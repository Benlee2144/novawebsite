# How To Actually Pray and Be Intimate With God — Not The Religious Version
### Conversation between Ben and Fredrick — February 23, 2026

---

This is the one that matters most practically. Because you can know all the theology, understand the Greek, see through the church's mistakes — and still feel like God is a million miles away when you try to talk to Him.

Most Christians have been taught a version of prayer that almost guarantees they'll never experience real intimacy with God. So let's tear down the false version first, then build the real one.

## What Prayer Is NOT

**It's not a performance.** Matthew 6:5 — *"And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men."* If your prayer sounds like it's meant to be overheard — fancy words, religious tone, theatrical emotion — you're performing, not communing.

**It's not repetition.** Matthew 6:7 — *"And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words."* God doesn't need you to say it five times for it to register. He heard you before you opened your mouth (Matthew 6:8 — "Your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him").

**It's not begging.** You're not a beggar at the gate. You're a son at the table. A child asks their father for something with confidence — they know the father loves them. They don't crawl on the floor crying "please, if it be thy will, maybe possibly consider my humble request."

**It's not a formula.** "Dear God... thank you for... please help with... in Jesus's name, amen." That's a template. It's not bad. But it's like reading a script to your wife every night instead of actually talking to her. Eventually the script replaces the relationship.

**It's not limited to a time and place.** The idea that prayer only happens when you close your eyes, fold your hands, and get on your knees in a quiet room — that's religion. Paul said "pray without ceasing" (1 Thessalonians 5:17). You can't cease if it only happens in a prayer closet. Prayer is supposed to be your DEFAULT STATE — an ongoing conversation, not an appointment.

## What Prayer Actually Is

The simplest definition: **Prayer is communion between your spirit and God's Spirit.**

That's it. Two spirits in contact. Everything else — words, posture, location, time — is just packaging. The content is CONTACT.

John 4:24 — *"God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."*

You connect to God spirit-to-Spirit. Not mind-to-God. Not emotions-to-God. Your spirit — the deepest part of you, the part that's already one with Him (1 Corinthians 6:17) — touches His Spirit. When that happens, THAT'S prayer. Whether words come out of your mouth or not.

## The Three Layers of Prayer

Think of prayer like the temple — which is a picture of YOU (1 Corinthians 6:19). The temple had three sections, and prayer operates the same way:

### 1. THE OUTER COURT — Soul Prayer (Mind + Emotions + Will)

This is where most Christians live permanently. It's praying from your soul:

- Talking AT God with your thoughts
- Reading a prayer list
- Asking for things
- Thanking Him for things
- Expressing emotions — joy, grief, frustration, fear

This is VALID. This isn't wrong. David prayed like this constantly in the Psalms. Raw, emotional, honest soul-prayers. "God, where are you? Why have you abandoned me? I'm angry. I'm scared. I'm grateful. I need help."

**The key with soul-prayer:** BE REAL. Stop using church language. Stop saying what you think God wants to hear. Say what's actually in you. If you're angry, say "I'm angry." If you're doubting, say "I'm doubting." If you don't feel Him, say "I don't feel you and it's driving me crazy."

Psalm 13:1 — *"How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?"* David didn't sanitize his prayers. He was raw. Honest. Messy. And God called him "a man after My own heart."

God isn't fragile. You can't offend Him with honesty. What offends Him is pretending. Performing. Saying words you don't mean with a voice you don't normally use.

**Talk to God like He's actually there. Because He is.**

### 2. THE HOLY PLACE — Spirit Prayer (Praying in the Spirit)

This is where it goes deeper than words.

**Romans 8:26-27** — *"Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God."*

There are things your spirit needs to communicate to God that your MIND doesn't have words for. The Holy Spirit — who lives IN your spirit — intercedes with groans that can't be articulated in human language. Your spirit is praying things your brain can't formulate.

This is where tongues fits (if you believe in that gift). But even without tongues, there's a kind of prayer that goes beyond words. You've probably felt it — moments where you're just PRESENT with God. No words. No requests. No agenda. Just... there. Together. Your spirit touching His Spirit without your mind's involvement.

**Ephesians 6:18** — *"Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit."* In the Spirit. Not in the mind.

**Jude 20** — *"But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit."* Praying in the Spirit BUILDS YOU UP.

How to get there practically: Start with soul-prayer (honest words). Then stop talking. Don't fill the silence. Don't move on to the next item on the list. Just... be still. Let your spirit settle. What often happens is a shift — you feel something change. The room feels different. Your chest feels different. Your mind might go quiet in a way it normally doesn't. That's your spirit taking over from your soul. Stay there. Don't analyze it. Don't try to understand it. Your mind will try to hijack it — "what is this? Am I doing this right? Is this real?" Ignore that. Stay in the stillness.

### 3. THE HOLY OF HOLIES — Union (Communion Beyond Prayer)

This is the deepest level. And it's barely talked about because it can't really be taught — only experienced.

**Psalm 46:10** — *"Be still, and know that I am God."*

The Hebrew word for "still" is **raphah** (רָפָה) — it means "to let go, to release, to stop striving, to become weak." It's not "be quiet." It's "STOP. Let go of everything. Release your grip. Become nothing."

When you truly let go — when your body is quiet, your soul is quiet, your mind stops churning — what's left is your spirit. And your spirit is ALREADY one with God (1 Corinthians 6:17). You don't have to CREATE the connection. It's already there. You just have to stop drowning it out with noise.

This is the place mystics and contemplatives throughout church history have described — the "cloud of unknowing," the "dark night of the soul," what Brother Lawrence called "practicing the presence of God." It's awareness of God that doesn't come through thoughts, emotions, or senses. It's KNOWING Him at the level where knowing doesn't need words.

**Exodus 33:11** — *"So the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend."*

Face to face. Friend to friend. No agenda. No requests. No formula. Just presence. That's the Holy of Holies experience. And it's available to you because the veil was torn (Matthew 27:51). The barrier between you and the deepest presence of God was ripped from TOP to bottom — God tore it, not man. You have access. Right now. Always.

## Practical Guide — How To Actually Do This

**Step 1: Show up.**
Pick a time. Ideally when you're alert, not exhausted. Don't start with an hour. Start with 10 minutes. Consistency matters more than duration. Same time every day if possible — your spirit starts to anticipate it.

**Step 2: Settle your body.**
Sit comfortably. Some people kneel. Some walk. Doesn't matter. The point is your body isn't demanding attention. Take a few deep breaths. Not as a ritual — just to shift your nervous system out of fight-or-flight mode.

**Step 3: Start honest.**
Talk. Out loud or in your head. But REAL. Not performative. Tell God what's actually going on.

"God, I'm tired. I'm stressed about money. I don't really feel you right now. I don't even know if I'm doing this right. But I'm here. I want to know you."

That's better than any eloquent prayer you've ever heard in church. Because it's TRUE. And God responds to truth.

**Step 4: Read a little.**
Not a Bible study. Not a chapter analysis. Take a short passage — a few verses, a Psalm, a couple lines from the Gospels — and read it SLOWLY. Not for information. For encounter. Ask "God, what are you saying to ME in this?" Then listen. Not with your ears. With your spirit. Something might jump out. A phrase might hit differently. A word might feel alive. That's the Word dividing soul and spirit (Hebrews 4:12). Follow that thread.

**Step 5: Stop talking.**
This is where most Christians bail. The silence feels awkward. Empty. Like nothing's happening. Your mind screams to fill it — check your phone, think about your day, plan dinner. RESIST. Stay in the silence.

The silence isn't empty. It's full. You just can't hear it yet because your soul is too loud. It's like trying to hear a whisper at a concert. The whisper is there. You need to turn down the other noise.

**Step 6: Listen.**
God's voice in your spirit doesn't usually sound like an audible voice. It comes as:
- A quiet knowing — suddenly you just KNOW something you didn't know before
- A phrase or sentence that drops into your mind that doesn't feel like your own thought
- A picture or image that forms without you creating it
- A deep peace that settles for no external reason
- A pull toward something — a person, an action, a scripture
- Conviction that's specific and gentle, not vague and condemning

**How to tell if it's God vs. your own thoughts vs. the enemy:**
- **God's voice** = specific, gentle, builds up, aligns with Scripture, produces peace even when it challenges you, usually quieter than you expect
- **Your own thoughts** = scattered, self-centered, familiar pattern, sounds like your normal inner monologue
- **The enemy** = condemning, vague guilt, accusation, fear, urgency without peace, "you're not good enough"

**Step 7: Respond.**
If He speaks, respond. Not with a religious answer. With a real one. "I hear you. I don't fully understand but I trust you." Or "That scares me but I'm willing." Or just "Thank you."

If He doesn't seem to speak — that's okay. He's still there. Sometimes presence without words IS the communication. A husband and wife sitting on the couch in comfortable silence aren't "not communicating." They're communicating intimacy. Being with someone without needing to fill the space IS relationship.

## Throughout Your Day — The Ongoing Conversation

The 10 minutes in the morning is the foundation. But the goal is 1 Thessalonians 5:17 — *"pray without ceasing."*

This means developing an AWARENESS of God throughout your day. Brother Lawrence (a 17th century monk) called it "practicing the presence of God." He worked in a kitchen. While washing dishes, cooking food, mopping floors — he maintained an inner conversation with God. Not formal prayers. Just ongoing awareness. "Lord, I sense you here. What do you think about this? I'm struggling right now. Thank you for that."

It's like texting someone you love throughout the day. Not formal letters. Just staying connected. "Hey." "Thinking about you." "That was cool." "I need help."

Your spirit is ALWAYS connected to God's Spirit. The connection never drops. You're just not always aware of it. The practice is learning to be aware of what's already there.

- Driving to work — "God, I'm anxious about this meeting. What do you want me to know?"
- Standing in line — "Holy Spirit, what do you see that I don't?"
- After a conversation — "Was there something you wanted me to say that I missed?"
- Before a decision — "Which way does my spirit lean? Not my fear. Not my logic. My spirit."

This is the life Jesus lived. He said "the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do" (John 5:19). He was in constant communion. Every decision, every conversation, every miracle came from that ongoing connection. And He said you'd do GREATER works (John 14:12).

## The Secret Nobody Tells You

Intimacy with God is more about RECEIVING than doing.

We're so programmed to perform — say the right words, pray the right way, do the right things. But intimacy isn't performance. It's presence. It's vulnerability. It's letting yourself be KNOWN.

**Psalm 139:1-4** — *"O LORD, You have searched me and known me. You know my sitting down and my rising up; You understand my thought afar off. You comprehend my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word on my tongue, but behold, O LORD, You know it altogether."*

He already knows everything about you. Every thought. Every fear. Every hidden thing you'd never tell anyone. And He's STILL here. He didn't leave. Knowing everything about you didn't make Him step back. He moved CLOSER.

The deepest prayer might just be: "You know me. You see all of it. And you're still here. Thank you."

That's intimacy. Not reaching for God. Realizing He's already holding you.

---

**1 John 4:19** — *"We love Him because He first loved us."*

You're not initiating this relationship. He already did. Every time you "feel" a pull toward prayer, toward Scripture, toward seeking Him — that's not you being spiritual. That's Him drawing you. He started it. He's always starting it. Your job isn't to create the connection. It's to stop resisting the one that's already there.
