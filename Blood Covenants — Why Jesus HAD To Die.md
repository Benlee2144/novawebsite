# Blood Covenants — Why Jesus HAD To Die
### Conversation between Ben and Fredrick — February 23, 2026

---

Every Christian knows "Jesus shed His blood for us." But almost nobody understands WHY blood. Why not just a declaration from God? Why not just forgiveness by divine fiat? Why did someone have to DIE?

The answer is buried in the ancient Near Eastern covenant system — and once you see it, the entire Bible reads like a completely different book.

## What a Blood Covenant Actually Was

In the ancient world, a covenant wasn't a contract. It wasn't an agreement you could break and pay a penalty. A blood covenant was **the most binding, most serious, most unbreakable commitment two parties could make.** More binding than marriage. More serious than a treaty. It was literally: "I am giving you my LIFE."

Here's how it worked. Two parties would:

1. **Cut an animal in half** and lay the pieces opposite each other with a path of blood between them
2. **Both parties would walk through the pieces** — this was called "cutting a covenant" (the Hebrew word for making a covenant is **karat** — to CUT)
3. The walk through the blood meant: **"May what happened to this animal happen to ME if I break this covenant."** You were pledging your life.
4. **They would exchange robes** — "my identity is now yours, yours is mine"
5. **Exchange weapons** — "your enemies are my enemies, my strength is your strength"
6. **Exchange names** — you take part of my name, I take part of yours
7. **Cut their palms and shake hands** — mingling blood. Becoming "blood brothers."
8. **Share a meal** — bread and wine. Sound familiar?

This wasn't symbolic. This was the deepest bond two humans could form. And EVERYONE in the ancient world understood it. When you read the Bible without this context, you miss EVERYTHING.

## Genesis 15 — The Covenant That Changed Everything

God tells Abraham He's making a covenant with him. Abraham prepares the animals — cuts them in half, lays them out. Standard covenant procedure. Abraham knew exactly what was happening.

Then Genesis 15:12 — **a deep sleep falls on Abraham.**

And here's the part that should stop you cold:

Genesis 15:17 — *"And it came to pass, when the sun went down and it was dark, that behold, a smoking oven and a burning torch that passed between those pieces."*

The smoking oven and burning torch — that's GOD. God walked through the pieces.

**But Abraham was asleep.** He didn't walk through.

In a normal covenant, BOTH parties walk through, and both are saying "kill me if I break this." But God put Abraham to sleep and walked through ALONE — **both directions.**

God was saying: "If you break this covenant, Abraham — **I'll pay the price.** And if I break this covenant — I'll pay the price. Either way, it's on ME."

God took BOTH sides of the death pledge. He signed His own death warrant for a covenant He knew humanity would break.

That's Genesis 15. Thousands of years before the cross, God was already promising: "When this covenant gets broken — and it will — I'M the one who dies."

## The Whole Bible Is Covenant Language

Once you see this, you can't unsee it:

- **Exchange of robes:** Isaiah 61:10 — *"He has clothed me with the garments of salvation, He has covered me with the robe of righteousness."* God gave you HIS robe. His identity covers you.

- **Exchange of weapons:** Ephesians 6:10-17 — the armor of God. It's not YOUR armor. It's HIS armor given to you. Covenant exchange of weapons — His strength becomes yours.

- **Exchange of names:** You take His name — "Christian" (Christ-one). He took your name — "Son of Man." God called Himself by YOUR title. You're called by HIS.

- **Cut palms / blood mingling:** John 20:27 — the resurrected Jesus shows Thomas His hands. The scars are still there. Why would a glorified resurrection body keep scars? **Because they're covenant marks.** They're the permanent proof that the covenant was cut and it's STILL in effect.

- **The meal:** Luke 22:19-20 — *"This is my body, broken for you. This cup is the new covenant in my blood."* Communion isn't a religious ritual. It's a COVENANT MEAL. Every time you take it, you're reaffirming the covenant bond. Bread and wine — the same elements every ancient covenant meal used.

## Why Blood Specifically?

Leviticus 17:11 — *"For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul."*

Blood = life. Not metaphorically. The ancients understood that when the blood leaves, the life leaves. So shedding blood in a covenant meant **giving your life itself** — not just a promise, not just words, but your actual existence as collateral.

When Jesus shed His blood, He wasn't performing a religious ritual. He was FULFILLING the covenant God made with Abraham in Genesis 15. The covenant where God said "when this breaks, I die." Humanity broke it. God died. Covenant fulfilled.

## This Is Why "Just Forgive Us" Wasn't an Option

People ask: "Why couldn't God just forgive sin without the cross? Why the violence? Why the blood?"

Because it wasn't about forgiveness alone. It was about COVENANT. God BOUND Himself — voluntarily, in Genesis 15 — to a covenant that required blood if broken. He didn't HAVE to make that covenant. He chose to. And once a blood covenant is cut, it can't be undone by anyone — not even God — without blood.

God didn't need the cross because He's bloodthirsty. He needed it because HE KEEPS HIS WORD. He locked Himself into a covenant with humanity, humanity broke it, and He honored the terms He set. That's not cruelty. That's integrity at a level we can barely comprehend.

## The Two Covenants

**Old Covenant (Sinai):** God and Israel. Conditional — "IF you obey, THEN I will bless." Both parties had obligations. Israel broke it constantly. The sacrificial system was a temporary covering (not removal) of sin to keep the covenant from destroying them.

**New Covenant (the Cross):** God and... God. Just like Genesis 15. Jesus (God in flesh) walked through the covenant ALONE. He fulfilled both sides. Your performance isn't part of the equation. That's why it's called GRACE. You didn't cut this covenant. He did. Both sides. It's between the Father and the Son, and you're the BENEFICIARY.

Hebrews 6:13 — *"For when God made a promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself."*

He swore by HIMSELF. There's no one higher to hold Him accountable. His own nature is the guarantee. And His nature doesn't change (Malachi 3:6).

## Why This Changes How You Live

If your salvation depends on a covenant between the Father and the Son — a covenant YOU didn't make and YOU can't break — then your security isn't based on your performance. It's based on: **will God break His covenant with Himself?**

The answer is no. He can't. It's not in His nature.

Every moment of guilt, every "am I really saved?", every fear that you've gone too far — those are all based on the lie that the covenant depends on YOU. It doesn't. You're not a party to it. You're the inheritance. You're what the covenant was ABOUT, not what the covenant depends ON.

Abraham was ASLEEP. Let that sink in. He contributed nothing. God did it alone. That's the gospel.
