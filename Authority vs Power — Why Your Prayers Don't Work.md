# Authority vs Power — Why Your Prayers Don't Work
### Conversation between Ben and Fredrick — February 23, 2026

This is why most Christians pray and nothing happens. They're asking for power when they already HAVE authority. And those are completely different things.

## Power vs. Authority — The Difference

A police officer stands in the middle of an intersection. A 40-ton semi truck is barreling toward him. The truck has infinitely more POWER than the officer. It could flatten him without slowing down.

But the officer raises his hand — and the truck stops.

Why? The officer has no power to stop the truck. He has AUTHORITY. He represents a government. Behind that badge is the entire legal system, the courts, the police force, the government. The truck driver doesn't stop because the officer is strong. He stops because of WHO THE OFFICER REPRESENTS.

Now flip that to the spiritual realm.

**Power** (Greek: **dynamis** — δύναμις) = raw force, ability, energy. This is where we get "dynamite." It's the ability to DO something.

**Authority** (Greek: **exousia** — ἐξουσία) = the RIGHT to use power. Delegated jurisdiction. Legal permission to act on behalf of someone greater.

Jesus didn't just give you power. He gave you AUTHORITY.

**Luke 10:19** — *"Behold, I give you the authority (exousia) to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power (dynamis) of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you."*

He gave you AUTHORITY over all the POWER of the enemy. Your authority outranks the enemy's power. Just like the officer's authority outranks the truck's power. You don't need to be stronger than the enemy. You just need to know who you represent.

## How Jesus Operated

Watch how Jesus handled things. He never begged God to do anything. He never said "Father, if it be thy will, please maybe possibly heal this person if you feel like it."

He COMMANDED.

- "Peace, be still" — to a storm (Mark 4:39)
- "Lazarus, come forth" — to a dead man (John 11:43)
- "Be clean" — to a leper (Mark 1:41)
- "Rise, take up your bed and walk" — to a paralytic (John 5:8)
- "Come out of him" — to a demon (Mark 1:25)

No begging. No asking. No "if it be thy will." He exercised AUTHORITY. He spoke and things obeyed because He had the LEGAL RIGHT to command them.

And then He turned around and said:

**John 14:12** — *"Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these will he do, because I go to My Father."*

GREATER works. Not lesser. Not "similar but smaller." Greater. Because when He went to the Father, He sent the Holy Spirit, and now the same authority is distributed across every believer on the planet simultaneously.

## Why Your Prayers Don't Work

Most Christians pray like beggars. "God, PLEASE heal my mother. God, PLEASE fix my finances. God, IF it's your will..."

That's not how authority works. Imagine that police officer standing in the intersection saying "Truck, PLEASE stop. Truck, if it's your will, could you maybe consider slowing down?"

He'd be dead.

Authority is exercised by DECLARATION, not petition. You don't ask the enemy to leave. You TELL him. You don't ask sickness to go. You COMMAND it. You don't beg God to do what He already authorized you to do. You EXERCISE the authority He already gave you.

There IS a place for petition. Philippians 4:6 says to make your requests known to God. But there's a difference between communing with your Father about your needs and BEGGING Him to do something He already delegated to you.

It's like a CEO who delegates a project to a manager. The manager keeps calling the CEO asking "should I do this? Can I do that? Please handle this for me." The CEO would say: "I GAVE you the authority. USE IT. Stop calling me to do YOUR job."

That's what a lot of prayer is. God already said "I give you authority over ALL the power of the enemy." And we're on our knees saying "God please deal with the enemy for me." He's saying "I already dealt with him. I gave YOU the badge. Go exercise it."

## The Legal Framework of the Spirit Realm

Here's what nobody teaches. The spirit realm operates on LEGALITY. Like a courtroom. Not raw force.

Satan isn't fighting God with power. He lost that fight at the cross (Colossians 2:15). What he does now is operate as an ATTORNEY. Remember his title? **The accuser** (Revelation 12:10). That's a LEGAL term. He's a prosecutor in a courtroom.

His whole strategy is legal accusations:

- "This person sinned — I have a right to afflict them"
- "This person is in fear — fear gives me legal access"
- "This person doesn't know their authority — they can't enforce the verdict against me"
- "This person agrees with my lies — their agreement is my permission"

And here's the thing — **he's technically right about the legal framework.** There ARE legal principles in the spirit realm. Sin CAN give the enemy access. Fear CAN open doors. Ignorance CAN prevent you from enforcing what's yours.

BUT — **the blood of Jesus settled the legal case PERMANENTLY.**

When Jesus said "it is finished," the Greek word is **tetelestai** (τετέλεσται). This wasn't just a spiritual statement. It was an ACCOUNTING term. In the first century, when a debt was paid in full, they would stamp the receipt with "tetelestai." PAID IN FULL.

Jesus wasn't just dying. He was filing the final legal document. Every accusation Satan could ever bring against any human — past, present, future — was answered by the blood. The case is closed. The debt stamp says PAID.

So when Satan accuses you now, he's bringing charges against a case that's already been adjudicated. He's a prosecutor trying to retry a case that has a permanent verdict of NOT GUILTY. He has no legal standing. But he does it anyway — because if YOU don't know the verdict, you'll accept the accusation as if it's valid.

**Your authority is the ability to ENFORCE the verdict that's already been rendered.**

You're not fighting FOR victory. You're fighting FROM victory. The war is won. You're enforcing the outcome.

## What This Looks Like Practically

**Sickness shows up.** The religious response: "God, please heal me if it's your will." The authority response: "By His stripes I WAS healed (1 Peter 2:24 — past tense, completed). Sickness, you have no legal right to this body. The blood speaks a better word (Hebrews 12:24). I enforce the finished work. Leave."

**Fear attacks.** The religious response: "God, please take this fear away." The authority response: "God has not given me a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind (2 Timothy 1:7). Fear, you are not from God and you have no authority here. I refuse your presence."

**Financial lack.** The religious response: "God, please provide." The authority response: "My God supplies all my needs according to His riches in glory (Philippians 4:19 — present tense, ongoing). Lack, you don't belong here. I am an heir of God and co-heir with Christ. Everything the Father has is available to me."

**The difference isn't arrogance.** It's POSITION. You're not commanding these things in your own name. You're commanding them in the name of Jesus — which means you're commanding them based on HIS authority, HIS finished work, HIS legal victory.

The officer doesn't stop the truck because he's personally powerful. He stops it because of the government behind the badge.

## Why The Church Doesn't Teach This

Same reason as everything else. **An empowered believer doesn't need a mediator.**

If you know you have authority, you handle things directly. You pray with boldness. You speak to mountains (Mark 11:23). You resist the devil and he flees (James 4:7). You don't need a "man of God" to pray over you. You don't need a special anointing service. You don't need to wait for a revival.

The authority is in YOU. Right now. Already given. Already authorized. Already legal.

The church kept you begging because beggars come back every week. Kings don't.

## Your Position

**Ephesians 1:19-21** — *"...and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come."*

**Ephesians 2:6** — *"and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus."*

Where is Christ? Far above ALL principality, power, might, and dominion. Where are YOU? Seated WITH Him. Same position. Same altitude. Same authority.

You're not under the enemy. You're not beside the enemy. You're ABOVE the enemy. Seated with Christ, far above all of it.

Start acting like it.
