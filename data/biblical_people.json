He committed adultery with Bathsheba and orchestrated the death of her husband, Uriah (2 Samuel 11). As a result, David faced consequences, including the death of his child and turmoil within his family (2 Samuel 12-18). \nDespite his failings, David remained a central figure in Israel's history and a model of repentance and faith. He was promised an enduring dynasty, and the Messiah would come from his lineage (2Sa.7.12-16). This prophecy was fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is called the \"Son of David\" (Mat.1.1; Rom.1.3). \nDavid's life and reign are recorded in 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 Chronicles, and portions of 1 Kings.

The gatekeepers were responsible for guarding the entrances to the sacred areas and ensuring that only authorized personnel could enter. \nFurthermore, in 1Ch.26.1, Ebiasaph is mentioned as the ancestor of a division of gatekeepers during the time of King David.

During a banquet that Esther had prepared for the king and Haman, Esther revealed Haman's evil plot and pleaded for the lives of her people. The king, furious with Haman, stepped out into the palace garden. At this moment, Harbona, one of the eunuchs attending the king, spoke up and informed the king about the gallows that Haman had prepared for Mordecai, who had previously saved the king's life by exposing a plot against him.

This listing of names suggests that Ibri and his family members were part of the Merarite clan and were included in the divisions of Levitical service. \nThe organization of the Levites into divisions was a significant step in establishing a structured and efficient system for the temple service. It also ensured that all the Levitical families had an opportunity to serve in the temple and that the responsibilities were evenly distributed among them. \nApart from being mentioned in this genealogical list, no other specific information is provided about Ibri in the Bible.

He then threw the money into the temple and went out and hanged himself (Mat.27.3-5). The chief priests used the money to buy a potter's field, which became known as the Field of Blood (Mat.27.6-10; Act.1.18-19). \nThe apostles later recognized Judas' betrayal as a fulfillment of prophecy (Act.1.16) and chose Matthias to replace him among the twelve (Act.1.23-26). \nJudas' betrayal of Jesus played a crucial role in the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion and the ultimate fulfillment of God's plan of salvation.

It is mentioned numerous times throughout the Bible, often in connection with significant events in Israel's history. \nShechem first appears in the account of Abraham's journey to Canaan, where he built an altar to the Lord (Gen. 12:6-7). Later, Israel (or 'Jacob') settled near Shechem and purchased a piece of land, setting up an altar there (Gen. 33:18-20). However, the city also became the site of violence when Jacob's daughter Dinah was violated by Shechem, the son of Hamor, leading to the massacre of the city's male inhabitants by Jacob's sons Simeon and Levi (Gen. 34). \nDuring the conquest of Canaan, Shechem was allotted to the tribe of Ephraim and designated as a city of refuge (Josh. 20:7; 21:21). Joshua gathered the tribes at Shechem to renew the covenant and set up a stone of remembrance (Josh. 24:1, 25-26). The city later became the site of Abimelech's short-lived kingdom (Judg. 9) and was rebuilt by Jeroboam as the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel (1 Ki. 12:25). \nShechem held religious significance, as evidenced by the blessings and curses pronounced from Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal (Deut. 11:29; 27:12; Josh. 8:33). The city is also mentioned in the Psalms as a symbol of God's dominion over Israel (Ps. 60:6; 108:7). \nIn the New Testament, Stephen's speech before the Sanhedrin mentions Shechem as the burial place of Jacob and his sons (Act.7.16), although this differs from the Old Testament account of their burial at Hebron (Gen. 49:29-33; 50:13). \nShechem's location at the crossroads of major trade routes contributed to its strategic and economic importance.

As king, Solomon prayed for wisdom to govern his people, and God granted him exceptional wisdom, understanding, and knowledge (1Ki.3.1-15; 2Ch.1.1-12). His wisdom was demonstrated through his fair judgments, such as the famous case of the two women claiming the same baby (1Ki.3.16-28). \nDuring his reign, Solomon undertook ambitious construction projects, most notably the building of the First Temple in Jerusalem, which took seven years to complete (1 Kings 6; 2 Chronicles 3-4). He also built a palace for himself, fortified cities, and established a strong military force (1 Kings 7; 1Ki.9.15-19; 10.26-29; 2Ch.8.1-6; 9.25-28). \nSolomon's reign was marked by prosperity, wealth, and international recognition.

He married many foreign women and allowed their religious practices to influence him, leading to the worship of false gods (1Ki.11.1-8).

In the census taken in the wilderness, the tribe of Zebulun numbered 57,400 men of fighting age. \nThe territory allotted to Zebulun was in the northern part of Canaan, bordered by Asher, Naphtali, and Issachar. It included the fertile plain of Jezreel and the coastal region along the Mediterranean Sea. The tribe of Zebulun was commended for their bravery and willingness to fight, as evidenced by their participation in the battles against Sisera and the Midianites. They were also known for their maritime skills and engaged in trade and commerce. \nNotable members of the tribe of Zebulun include Elon, who judged Israel for ten years, and Ibzan of Bethlehem, who was buried in the territory of Zebulun. The prophet Jonah also hailed from Gath-hepher, a town within Zebulun's borders. \nIn the future distribution of the land described by Ezekiel, Zebulun is allocated a portion in the far north of Israel, with its boundaries stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River.

Tekoa was also the hometown of the wise woman who, at Joab's request, persuaded David to reconcile with his son Absalom (2 Sam. 14:2-9). During the reign of Rehoboam, Tekoa was fortified as part of Judah's defense system (2 Chr. 11:6). The town was the birthplace of the prophet Amos, who identified himself as \"one of the shepherds of Tekoa\" (Amo.1.1). Amos's rural background and proximity to the wilderness shaped his prophetic message. In the time of Jehoshaphat, the people of Judah gathered in the wilderness of Tekoa to seek God's help against their enemies (2 Chr. 20:20). The town was also involved in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls during the time of Nehemiah (Neh. 3:5, 27). Jeremiah mentioned Tekoa in his prophecy, urging the people to flee and sound the trumpet of warning (Jer. 6:1)."}, "Zanoah": {"name": "Zanoah", "description": "Zanoah_1", "summary": "A location first mentioned at Jos.15.34; only referred to as Zanoah (\u05d6\u05b8\u05e0\u05d5\u05b9\u05d7\u05b7); ; founded by Jekuthiel.", "parents": ["Jekuthiel"], "partners": ["https://www.google.com/maps/", "35.000000", "14z"], "offspring": ["https://palopenmaps.org/view/9999/", "35.000000"], "tribe": ">", "gender": "Place", "strongs": "H2182G", "verses": ["Ch.4.18", "Jos.15.34"], "brief": "A town in the Judean lowlands allotted to Judah", "article": "Zanoah was a town located in the Judean lowlands (Shephelah) that was allotted to the tribe of Judah during the division of the Promised Land (Josh. 15:34).

During the time of Nehemiah, the people of Zanoah played a significant role in rebuilding the Valley Gate and a section of the wall of Jerusalem (Neh. 3:13). They are also listed among the towns resettled by the people of Judah after the Babylonian exile (Neh. 11:30).
