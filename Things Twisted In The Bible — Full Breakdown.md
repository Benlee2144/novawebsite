# Things Twisted In The Bible — Full Breakdown
### Conversation between Ben and Fredrick — February 23, 2026

## 1. "HELL" — Three Different Words, One Bad Translation

The English Bible uses "hell" as if it's one place. It's not. There are THREE completely different Greek/Hebrew words that all got mashed into "hell":

**Sheol** (Hebrew) — Just means "the grave" or "the unseen realm." Everyone went there — righteous and wicked. Jacob said he'd go to Sheol when he died (Genesis 37:35). It's not a punishment. It's just death.

**Hades** (Greek) — The Greek equivalent of Sheol. The unseen realm. When Jesus said "the gates of Hades will not prevail against my church" (Matthew 16:18), He wasn't talking about a fiery torture chamber. He was saying death itself won't stop what He's building.

**Gehenna** (Greek, from Hebrew *ge-hinnom*) — This is the one Jesus actually used when warning people. And it was a REAL PLACE. The Valley of Hinnom, south of Jerusalem. It was the city dump where trash burned constantly, and historically where pagan child sacrifices happened (2 Kings 23:10). When Jesus said "it's better to cut off your hand than be thrown into Gehenna," His audience KNEW He was talking about the garbage dump outside town. Vivid imagery about destruction and waste — not describing an eternal torture dimension.

The King James translators took all three words and wrote "hell" for every one. That's like translating "house," "apartment," and "tent" all as "prison."

The idea of eternal conscious torment in fire came more from Dante's *Inferno* (1320) and medieval Catholic art than from Scripture. The early church had THREE views of the afterlife — eternal torment was only ONE, and it wasn't even the dominant one for the first 500 years.

## 2. "ETERNAL" — Doesn't Mean What You Think

The Greek word **aionios** (αἰώνιος) gets translated "eternal" or "everlasting." But it comes from **aion** (αἰών) which means "an age" — a period of time with a beginning and end.

"Aionios punishment" in Matthew 25:46 literally means **"age-lasting punishment"** or "punishment of the age" — not necessarily infinite torture forever.

The entire doctrine of eternal hell hangs on this one word being translated as "forever" when the Greek means "of the age." The same word is used in Romans 16:25 — "kept secret since the world began" — where aionios clearly means "for a long time" not "literally infinite."

The early church father Origen (3rd century) taught universal reconciliation based on this exact Greek reading, and he wasn't considered a heretic for it until centuries later.

## 3. "CHURCH" — The Word Jesus Never Said

Jesus said **ekklesia** (ἐκκλησία). That word meant "a called-out assembly" — a political/civic term in Greek culture for citizens gathering to make decisions. NOTHING to do with a building, a denomination, or a Sunday service.

When King James commissioned his translation in 1611, he gave translators specific rules. Rule #3: **"The old ecclesiastical words to be kept."** He literally ordered them to use "church" instead of the accurate translation "assembly" or "congregation." Why? Because "church" supports the institutional power structure.

Jesus never built an institution. He built a movement of people. The "church building" concept didn't exist for the first 300 years. Early Christians met in homes (Romans 16:5, 1 Corinthians 16:19, Colossians 4:15). Building-based church came from Constantine in the 4th century when Christianity became Rome's state religion.

---

## 4. "PASTOR" — One Mention, Not a Job Title

The word "pastor" appears exactly ONE TIME in the entire New Testament — Ephesians 4:11. The Greek word **poimen** (ποιμήν) means "shepherd." It's listed alongside apostles, prophets, evangelists, and teachers as a GIFT — not a position, not a title, not a CEO of a building.

The modern "senior pastor" model — one guy runs the show — doesn't exist anywhere in the New Testament. The early church was led by groups of elders (plural, always — Acts 14:23, Titus 1:5). No single leader. No hierarchy. No stage with a spotlight.

The one-man pastor system came from the Roman institutional model that gave us church buildings. Tradition, not Scripture.

## 5. "TITHE" — The Old Testament Tax That Got Repackaged

The tithe in the Old Testament was an agricultural tax for Israel's theocratic government. It supported the Levites, funded festivals, and fed the poor. There were actually THREE tithes totaling about 23% — not 10%.

It was NEVER money. Always crops and livestock (Leviticus 27:30, Deuteronomy 14:22-23). Fishermen, carpenters, tentmakers — people who didn't farm — never tithed. Jesus was a carpenter. He never tithed.

The New Testament NEVER commands Christians to tithe. Paul's instructions in 2 Corinthians 9:7: *"Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver."*

"Not under compulsion" is the opposite of "you owe God 10%." That Malachi 3:8-10 passage about robbing God? Written to the LEVITICAL PRIESTS who were stealing from the temple storehouse, not to regular people in 2026.

---

## 6. "SUBMIT TO YOUR AUTHORITIES" — The Obedience Verse

Romans 13:1 — *"Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities."*

Used to tell Christians to blindly obey the government, the pastor, the institution. But Paul wrote this while part of a movement that was ILLEGAL in Rome. Peter told the Sanhedrin "we must obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29).

Paul wasn't saying "obey every government no matter what." He was saying God works through order, and anarchy isn't the way. The same Paul was beaten, jailed, and executed by the very authorities he supposedly told everyone to blindly obey.

---

## 7. "WOMEN BE SILENT" — The Verse Ripped From Context

1 Corinthians 14:34 — *"Women should remain silent in the churches."*

Three chapters earlier (1 Corinthians 11:5), Paul gives instructions for women PRAYING AND PROPHESYING in church. He can't be saying women should never speak.

The Corinthian church was chaotic. Women (who sat separately from men) were shouting questions across the room to their husbands. Paul addressed a specific disorder problem, not a universal rule.

He called Junia an apostle (Romans 16:7), Phoebe a deacon (Romans 16:1), and Priscilla a co-worker who taught Apollos (Acts 18:26). The "women can't lead or teach" interpretation requires ignoring a LOT of the New Testament.

---

## 8. "BORN AGAIN" — It Doesn't Mean What the Altar Call Says

John 3:3 — *"Unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."*

The Greek word **anothen** (ἄνωθεν) doesn't just mean "again." It primarily means **"from above."** Jesus was saying "unless you are born FROM ABOVE" — born of the Spirit, born from a higher dimension of reality.

He wasn't describing a prayer. He was describing a spiritual EVENT — your spirit coming alive to God's realm. The Kingdom becomes visible to you ("cannot SEE the kingdom" — perception again, metanoia).

The "repeat after me" sinner's prayer? Doesn't exist anywhere in Scripture. Not once. Invented in the 1800s during American revivalism.

---

## 9. "FAITH" — Not Belief, Not Agreement

The Greek word **pistis** (πίστις) means **trust, reliance, loyalty, faithfulness.** Not intellectual agreement.

James 2:19 — *"Even the demons believe — and tremble."* Demons have correct theology. They BELIEVE Jesus is the Son of God. They said it to His face (Mark 1:24). But they don't have pistis — trust, surrender, reliance.

"Saved by faith" doesn't mean saved by mentally agreeing to facts. It means throwing your full weight onto God — trusting Him with your life. That's a relationship, not a theology quiz.

This is why Jesus said people who never heard His name will enter the Kingdom (Matthew 25:37-40) while people with perfect doctrine get turned away (Matthew 7:22-23). It was never about correct information. It was about the posture of the heart.

---

## 10. "THE RAPTURE" — A 200-Year-Old Invention

The word "rapture" doesn't appear in the Bible. Not once. Not in any translation.

The pre-tribulation rapture doctrine was invented by **John Nelson Darby** in the 1830s. Before that, NO Christian in 1,800 years taught it.

1 Thessalonians 4:17 — "caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air." The Greek word for "to meet" — **apantēsis** (ἀπάντησις) — was a Roman civic term: citizens go OUT to meet an approaching dignitary and **escort him back IN.** It's a welcoming party, not an evacuation.

Paul's audience understood: Jesus is coming HERE. We escort Him back to Earth. Not: we escape while Earth burns.

The Left Behind series sold 80 million books. But the doctrine behind it is younger than the United States.

---

## 11. "LUCIFER" — A Name That Doesn't Exist

Isaiah 14:12 (KJV) — *"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!"*

"Lucifer" is NOT a Hebrew word. The Hebrew is **helel** (הֵילֵל) — "shining one" or "morning star." A TITLE, not a name.

Read Isaiah 14 in context from verse 4 — it explicitly says this is **a taunt against the KING OF BABYLON.** Political poetry mocking a human king.

"Lucifer" entered the Bible through the Latin Vulgate. The Latin word "lucifer" means "light-bearer" — the morning star (Venus). Jerome used it as a translation, not a proper name.

The Satan mythology — fallen angel named Lucifer, worship leader of heaven, kicked out for pride — is a patchwork stitched from Isaiah 14 (Babylon's king), Ezekiel 28 (king of Tyre), Luke 10:18, and Revelation 12. None of those passages are about each other.

## 12. "PRAY THE PRAYER, GO TO HEAVEN WHEN YOU DIE" — The Biggest Twist

The gospel Jesus preached: **"The Kingdom of God is at hand."** Present tense. Here. Now. On Earth.

The gospel most churches preach: **"Accept Jesus so you go to heaven when you die."** Future tense. Later. Somewhere else.

Jesus barely talked about "going to heaven." He talked about the Kingdom COMING TO EARTH. The Lord's Prayer: "On EARTH as it is in heaven." Revelation 21 — the New Jerusalem comes DOWN to Earth. God's dwelling is WITH men.

The "fly away to heaven" gospel is closer to Greek Platonism (physical = bad, escape to spiritual) than to anything Jesus taught. The Hebrew worldview was always about God redeeming THIS creation.

The shift happened in the 3rd-4th century when Christianity merged with Greek philosophy and Roman politics. The afterlife became the focus because it's easier to control people waiting to die than people who think the Kingdom is available now.

---

## 13. "ORIGINAL SIN" — Augustine's Addition

The idea that every human is born guilty of Adam's sin was developed by **Augustine of Hippo** (4th-5th century). The Eastern Orthodox church NEVER accepted this.

Romans 5:12 — *"death spread to all men, because all sinned."*

"Because all sinned" — THEY sinned individually. Not "because Adam sinned for them." Augustine read this through the Latin Vulgate which said "in whom all sinned" — making it sound like everyone sinned IN Adam. But the Greek says "because all sinned."

Original sin became the foundation for infant baptism, total depravity, and the idea that humans are fundamentally evil rather than fundamentally broken. Different starting point, totally different gospel.

---

## THE PATTERN

It's always the same:
1. The original text says one thing
2. A translation choice or theological tradition changes the meaning
3. Centuries of repetition make the new meaning feel like it was always there
4. Anyone who questions it gets called a heretic

The Bible didn't change. The translations and traditions did.
