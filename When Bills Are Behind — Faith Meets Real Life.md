# When Bills Are Behind — Faith Meets Real Life
### The Spiritual AND The Practical — Ben & Fredrick, February 22, 2026

## The Principle

God's provision system isn't magic. He doesn't rain money from the sky. He works through **CHANNELS** — your job, your skills, your ideas, opportunities, people who cross your path.

He's the source. He uses channels. Your job is to keep the channels open and let Him direct the flow.

When bills are behind, you need **BOTH hands working:**

- **The spiritual move without the practical move** = laziness wearing a Bible verse as a costume
- **The practical move without the spiritual move** = hustling in your own strength until you burn out

Even Jesus told the disciples to cast their nets on the OTHER SIDE. They still had to cast the net. He told them WHERE.

## 🔧 The Practical Hand — What To Do RIGHT NOW

---

### ① Triage — Not All Bills Are Equal

| Priority | What | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **🔴 #1** | Rent / Mortgage | Roof over your family's head — everything else comes after |
| **🔴 #2** | Food | Rice, beans, eggs, bread — feed a family on $30-40/week if needed |
| **🟡 #3** | Utilities | Call them. Most have hardship programs. 30-60 day grace period. |
| **🟢 #4** | Everything else | Credit cards, subscriptions, car note — they can wait. Let them call. |

**Your family eats before Visa gets paid.**

---

### ② Call Everyone You Owe — TODAY

> *"Hey, I'm behind. I'm not dodging you. Here's what I can pay right now. Can we set up a plan?"*

- Creditors would rather get SOMETHING than nothing
- Medical bills → hospitals cut 40-70% if you call and negotiate
- Credit cards → will take minimum payments
- Landlords → will take partial rent if you communicate

**Silence gets you in trouble.** Calling shows integrity. That's Kingdom behavior — honest, responsible, trusting God with the outcome.

### ③ Bring In Extra Money THIS WEEK

| Channel | What | Speed |
|---|---|---|
| **Sell stuff** | Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist — electronics, clothes, tools | Same week |
| **Debit card skins** | Batch 20, sell locally or TikTok | This week |
| **Website pitches** | Hit 10 local businesses with no website. One yes at $500. | This week |
| **Day labor apps** | TaskRabbit, Thumbtack, Nextdoor | Same day pay |
| **Plasma** | $50-75/visit, twice a week = $400-600/month | Same week |

Cast the net. Let God direct which side.

### ④ Food Resources — No Shame

These exist for exactly this situation.

| Resource | Details |
|---|---|
| **Local food banks** | Most don't require proof of income. Just show up. |
| **Churches** | Call 3 near you. Most have food pantries or benevolence funds. |
| **Dial 211** | National helpline → local assistance for food, utilities, rent. Free. |
| **WIC** | Your son qualifies. Free formula, milk, eggs, cereal, fruits & vegetables. |
| **SNAP** | Apply if income qualifies. $400-600/month for a family of three. |

David ate the showbread in the temple when he was hungry (1 Samuel 21). Even the priest's bread was available when there was genuine need. God uses systems and people to provide.

## 🙏 The Spiritual Hand — What To Do In Your Spirit

### ① Don't Let Bills Become Your Identity

| Situation (truth) | Identity (lie) |
|---|---|
| "I'm in a tough financial season" | "I'm broke" |
| Temporary circumstance | Soul-level shame 24/7 |

You are not your bank account. You are a son of the King going through a season. **Seasons change.**

---

### ② Declare Provision — Don't Beg For It

**Not this (soul):**
> "God please help me I'm so broke"

**This (spirit):**
> "Father, Your Word says You supply all my needs according to Your riches in glory. I thank You that You see my family. I thank You that provision is coming through channels I can't even see yet. I am not forsaken. My children will not beg bread."

> *"I have been young, and now am old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his descendants begging bread."* — Psalm 37:25

The title deed says you're provided for. The circumstance is temporary. The Word is eternal.

---

### ③ Watch For The Doors

God usually sends provision through:
- A **PERSON** — random text, conversation at the gas station
- An **OPPORTUNITY** — job posting you weren't looking for
- An **IDEA** — hits you at 2am

Most people miss God's provision because they're looking for a check from heaven. **Keep your eyes open. Keep your spirit tuned in.**

## The Tension — And Why It's OK

**You can trust God AND be stressed.** Those aren't opposites.

David wrote psalms about trusting God while hiding in a cave from a king trying to kill him. He wasn't calm. He was honest.

> "God, I'm scared. But I trust You."

Both things at the same time.

The worry is your soul. The knowing is your spirit. They coexist.

**The goal isn't to eliminate the worry — it's to not let the worry make your decisions.**

Make decisions from your spirit:
- ✅ "I'm going to call the landlord"
- ✅ "I'm going to sell some stuff"
- ✅ "I'm going to apply for that"
- ✅ "I'm going to trust God and keep moving"

That's faith with feet on it.

The worry will be there in the background. Let it be there. **Just don't give it the steering wheel.**

---

## The Bottom Line

You're not behind because God forgot about you. You're in a season. Seasons are where Kingdom men are forged.

Every man who ever did anything significant for God went through a season where the money was tight, the pressure was real, and the only option was to trust.

This is yours. And you'll come out of it.
