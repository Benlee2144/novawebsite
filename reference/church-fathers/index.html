    <div class="father-card">
      <div class="father-name">Clement of Rome</div>
      <div class="father-dates">c. 35–99 AD • Bishop of Rome</div>
      <div class="father-bio">
        Clement was the third or fourth bishop of Rome. Tradition identifies him with the Clement mentioned by Paul in Philippians 4:3. His letter to the Corinthians (c. 96 AD) is one of the oldest surviving Christian documents outside the New Testament, written to address division in the Corinthian church — remarkably similar to the problems Paul addressed 40 years earlier.

      <div class="father-dates">c. 35–108 AD • Bishop of Antioch, Martyr</div>
      <div class="father-bio">
        Ignatius was the second or third bishop of Antioch (where believers were first called "Christians," Acts 11:26). Condemned to death by wild beasts, he wrote seven letters to churches while being escorted to Rome for execution. His letters are passionate defenses of Christ's real humanity and divinity, church unity under the bishop, and the reality of the Eucharist.

      <div class="father-dates">c. 69–155 AD • Bishop of Smyrna, Martyr</div>
      <div class="father-bio">
        Polycarp was a direct disciple of the apostle John. Irenaeus recalls sitting at Polycarp's feet as a boy, listening to him recount conversations with John and others "who had seen the Lord." At age 86, Polycarp was burned at the stake for refusing to deny Christ. His martyrdom account is the earliest detailed Christian martyrdom narrative outside the New Testament.

      <div class="father-bio">
        "The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles" is possibly the oldest surviving Christian document outside the New Testament. It's a practical manual covering ethics (the "Two Ways"), baptism, fasting, prayer (includes the Lord's Prayer), the Eucharist, and how to identify true vs. false prophets. It provides a remarkable window into the daily life of the earliest Christian communities.

      <div class="father-dates">c. 100–165 AD • Philosopher, Apologist, Martyr</div>
      <div class="father-bio">
        Justin was a pagan philosopher who converted to Christianity after encountering an old man who pointed him to the Hebrew prophets. He became the most important Christian apologist of the 2nd century, arguing that Christianity was the "true philosophy." His <em>First Apology</em> includes the earliest detailed description of Christian Sunday worship: Scripture reading, a homily, communal prayers, and the Eucharist.
      </div>
      <div class="father-quote">
        "We have been taught that Christ is the first-born of God, and we have shown that He is the Word of whom every race of men were partakers; and those who lived reasonably are Christians, even though they have been thought atheists."

      <div class="father-dates">c. 130–202 AD • Bishop of Lyon</div>
      <div class="father-bio">
        Irenaeus was a student of Polycarp (who was a student of John), making him only two generations removed from the apostles. His massive work <em>Against Heresies</em> is the most important early refutation of Gnosticism. He is the earliest writer to argue for the authority of all four Gospels (and only four), and his theology of "recapitulation" — Christ undoing Adam's failure — profoundly shaped Christian thought.

      <div class="father-dates">c. 155–220 AD • Theologian, Carthage</div>
      <div class="father-bio">
        Tertullian was the first major Christian writer in Latin and coined many theological terms still used today, including "Trinity" (<em>trinitas</em>), "three persons, one substance," and "Old/New Testament." A brilliant and combative writer, he defended Christianity against Roman persecution and heresy. Later in life, he joined the Montanist movement.

      <div class="father-dates">c. 185–253 AD • Scholar, Theologian</div>
      <div class="father-bio">
        Origen was arguably the most brilliant and prolific scholar of the early church. He produced the <em>Hexapla</em>, a massive side-by-side comparison of six versions of the Old Testament (Hebrew, Greek transliteration, Aquila, Symmachus, LXX, and Theodotion). His commentaries covered nearly every book of the Bible. While some of his speculative theology was later condemned, his textual and exegetical work was unparalleled.
