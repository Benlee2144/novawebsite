<div class="era-divider">Apostolic Fathers (c. 70&ndash;150 AD)</div>

<div class="father-card">
  <div class="father-name">Clement of Rome</div>
  <div class="father-dates">c. 35&ndash;99 AD &bull; Bishop of Rome</div>
  <div class="father-bio">Clement was the third or fourth bishop of Rome. Tradition identifies him with the Clement mentioned by Paul in Philippians 4:3. His letter to the Corinthians (c. 96 AD) is one of the oldest surviving Christian documents outside the New Testament, written to address division in the Corinthian church &mdash; remarkably similar to the problems Paul addressed 40 years earlier.</div>
  <div class="father-quote">&ldquo;The apostles received the gospel for us from the Lord Jesus Christ; Jesus the Christ was sent from God. Christ, therefore, is from God, and the apostles are from Christ.&rdquo;<cite>&mdash; 1 Clement 42:1&ndash;2</cite></div>

<div class="father-card">
  <div class="father-name">Ignatius of Antioch</div>
  <div class="father-dates">c. 35&ndash;108 AD &bull; Bishop of Antioch, Martyr</div>
  <div class="father-bio">Ignatius was the second or third bishop of Antioch (where believers were first called &ldquo;Christians,&rdquo; Acts 11:26). Condemned to death by wild beasts, he wrote seven letters to churches while being escorted to Rome for execution. His letters are passionate defenses of Christ&rsquo;s real humanity and divinity, church unity under the bishop, and the reality of the Eucharist.</div>
  <div class="father-quote">&ldquo;Where the bishop is, there let the people be, as where Jesus Christ is, there is the catholic church.&rdquo;<cite>&mdash; Ignatius, Letter to the Smyrnaeans 8:2 (first use of &ldquo;catholic church&rdquo;)</cite></div>
  <div class="father-works"><h4>Key Works (7 Letters)</h4>

  <div class="father-name">Polycarp of Smyrna</div>
  <div class="father-dates">c. 69&ndash;155 AD &bull; Bishop of Smyrna, Martyr</div>
  <div class="father-bio">Polycarp was a direct disciple of the apostle John. Irenaeus recalls sitting at Polycarp&rsquo;s feet as a boy, listening to him recount conversations with John and others &ldquo;who had seen the Lord.&rdquo; At age 86, Polycarp was burned at the stake for refusing to deny Christ. His martyrdom account is the earliest detailed Christian martyrdom narrative outside the New Testament.</div>
  <div class="father-quote">&ldquo;Eighty-six years I have served Him, and He has done me no wrong. How can I blaspheme my King who saved me?&rdquo;<cite>&mdash; Polycarp, at his martyrdom (Martyrdom of Polycarp 9:3)</cite></div>

  <div class="father-dates">c. 50&ndash;120 AD &bull; Anonymous</div>
  <div class="father-bio">&ldquo;The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles&rdquo; is possibly the oldest surviving Christian document outside the New Testament. It&rsquo;s a practical manual covering ethics (the &ldquo;Two Ways&rdquo;), baptism, fasting, prayer (includes the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer), the Eucharist, and how to identify true vs. false prophets.</div>
  <div class="father-quote">&ldquo;But concerning baptism, baptize this way: Having first said all these things, baptize into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, in living [running] water.&rdquo;<cite>&mdash; Didache 7:1</cite></div>

<div class="era-divider">Apologists &amp; Early Theologians (c. 100&ndash;250 AD)</div>

<div class="father-card">
  <div class="father-name">Justin Martyr</div>
  <div class="father-dates">c. 100&ndash;165 AD &bull; Philosopher, Apologist, Martyr</div>
  <div class="father-bio">Justin was a pagan philosopher who converted to Christianity after encountering an old man who pointed him to the Hebrew prophets. He became the most important Christian apologist of the 2nd century. His <em>First Apology</em> includes the earliest detailed description of Christian Sunday worship: Scripture reading, a homily, communal prayers, and the Eucharist.</div>
  <div class="father-quote">&ldquo;We have been taught that Christ is the first-born of God, and we have shown that He is the Word of whom every race of men were partakers; and those who lived reasonably are Christians, even though they have been thought atheists.&rdquo;<cite>&mdash; Justin Martyr, First Apology 46</cite></div>

  <div class="father-name">Irenaeus of Lyon</div>
  <div class="father-dates">c. 130&ndash;202 AD &bull; Bishop of Lyon</div>
  <div class="father-bio">Irenaeus was a student of Polycarp (who was a student of John), making him only two generations removed from the apostles. His massive work <em>Against Heresies</em> is the most important early refutation of Gnosticism. He is the earliest writer to argue for the authority of all four Gospels (and only four).</div>
  <div class="father-quote">&ldquo;The glory of God is a human being fully alive, and the life of a human being is the vision of God.&rdquo;<cite>&mdash; Irenaeus, Against Heresies IV.20.7</cite></div>

  <div class="father-dates">c. 155&ndash;220 AD &bull; Theologian, Carthage</div>
  <div class="father-bio">Tertullian was the first major Christian writer in Latin and coined many theological terms still used today, including &ldquo;Trinity&rdquo; (<em>trinitas</em>), &ldquo;three persons, one substance,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Old/New Testament.&rdquo; A brilliant and combative writer, he defended Christianity against Roman persecution and heresy.</div>

  <div class="father-name">Origen of Alexandria</div>
  <div class="father-dates">c. 185&ndash;253 AD &bull; Scholar, Theologian</div>
  <div class="father-bio">Origen was arguably the most brilliant and prolific scholar of the early church. He produced the <em>Hexapla</em>, a massive side-by-side comparison of six versions of the Old Testament. His commentaries covered nearly every book of the Bible.</div>
  <div class="father-quote">&ldquo;The Scriptures were written by the Spirit of God, and have a meaning, not such only as is apparent at first sight, but also another, which escapes the notice of most.&rdquo;<cite>&mdash; Origen, De Principiis IV.1.9</cite></div>
