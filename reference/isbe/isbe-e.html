          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">e&#x27;-g&#x27;-l (nesher; aetos; Latin aquila): A bird of the genus aquila of the family falconidae.The Hebrew nesher, meaning &quot;to tear with the beak,&quot; is almost invariably translated &quot;eagle,&quot; throughout the Bible; yet many of the most important references compel the admission that the bird to which they applied was a vulture.There were many large birds and carrion eaters flocking over Palestine, attracted by the offal from animals slaughtered for tribal feasts and continuous sacrifice. The eagle family could not be separated from the vultures by their habit of feeding, for they ate the offal from slaughter as well as the vultures. One distinction always holds good. Eagles never flock. They select the tallest trees of the forest, the topmost crag of the mountain, and pairs live in solitude, hunting and feeding singly, whenever possible carrying their prey to the nest so that the young may gain strength and experience by tearing at it and feeding themselves. The vultures are friendly, and collect and feed in flocks. So wherever it is recorded that a &quot;flock came down on a carcass,&quot; there may have been an eagle or two in it, but the body of it were vultures. Because they came in such close contact with birds of prey, the natives came nearer dividing them into families than any birds. Of perhaps a half-dozen, they recognized three eagles, they knew three vultures, four or five falcons, and several kites; but almost every Biblical reference is translated &quot;eagle,&quot; no matter how evident the text makes it that the bird was a vulture.For example, Mic 1:16: &quot;Make thee bald, and cut off thy hair for the children of thy delight: enlarge thy baldness as the eagle (m &quot;vulture&quot;); for they are gone into captivity from thee.&quot; This is a reference to the custom of shaving the head when in mourning, but as Palestine knew no bald eagle, the text could refer only to the bare head and neck of the griffon vulture. The eagles were, when hunger-driven, birds of prey; the vultures, carrion feeders only. There was a golden eagle (the osprey of the King James Version), not very common, distinguished by its tan-colored head; the imperial eagle, more numerous and easily identified by a dark head and white shoulders; a spotted eagle; a tawny eagle, much more common and readily distinguished by its plumage; and the short-toed eagle, most common of all and especially a bird of prey, as also a small hooded eagle so similar to a vulture that it was easily mistaken for one, save that it was very bold about taking its own food.The first Biblical reference to the eagle referred to the right bird. Ex 19:4: &quot;Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles&#x27; wings, and brought you unto myself.&quot; This &quot;bare you on eagles&#x27; wings&quot; must not be interpreted to mean that an eagle ever carried anything on its back. It merely means that by strength of powerful wing it could carry quite a load with its feet and frequently was seen doing this. Vultures never carried anything; they fea...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">er (&#x27;ozen; ous, otion, the latter word (literally, &quot;earlet&quot;) in all the Gospels only used of the ear of the high priest&#x27;s servant, which was cut off by Peter: Mt 26:51; Mr 14:47; Lu 22:51 (not 22:50); Joh 18:10,26):(1) The physical organ of hearing which was considered of peculiar importance as the chief instrument by which man receives information and commandments. For this reason the ear of the priest had to be specially sanctified, the tip of the right ear being touched with sacrificial blood at the consecration (Le 8:23). Similarly the ear of the cleansed leper had to be rededicated to the service of God by blood and oil (Le 14:14,17,25,28). The ear-lobe of a servant, who preferred to remain with the family of his master rather than become free in the seventh year, was to be publicly bored or pierced with an awl in token of perpetual servitude (Ex 21:6). It has been suggested that Ps 40:6 should be interpreted in this sense, but this is not probable (see below). The cutting off of the ears and noses of captives was an atrocious custom of war frequently alluded to in oriental literature, (Eze 23:25). The phrase &quot;to open the ear,&quot; which originally means the uncovering of the ear by partially removing the turban, so as to permit a clearer hearing, is used in the sense of revealing a secret or of giving important (private) information (1Sa 9:15; 20:2,12,13; 2Sa 7:27; 1Ch 17:25; Ps 40:6), and the New Testament promises similarly that &quot;things which eye saw not, and ear heard not&quot; are to be revealed by the reconciled God to the heart that in gladsome surrender has come to Him to be taught by His spirit (1Co 2:9).(2) The inner ear, the organ of spiritual perception. If the ear listens, the heart willingly submits, but often the spiritual ear is &quot;hardened&quot; (Isa 6:10; Zec 7:11; Mt 13:15; Ac 28:27), or &quot;heavy&quot; (Isa 6:10; De 29:4), either by self-seeking obstinacy or by the judgment of an insulted God. Such unwilling hearers are compared to the &quot;deaf adder .... which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely&quot; (Ps 58:4,5; Pr 21:13; 28:9; Ac 7:57). The expression &quot;He that hath ears to hear let him hear&quot; is frequent in the Synoptic Gospels, occurring 7 or 8 times: Mt 11:15; Mt 13:9,43; Mr 4:9,23 (7:16 the Revised Version (British and American) omits); Lu 8:8; 14:35, and while not found in the Fourth Gospel, it occurs seven times in Re 2 and 3. &quot;Itching ears,&quot; on the other hand, are those that have become tired of the sound of oft-repeated truth and that long for new though deceitful teaching (2Ti 4:3). Ears may &quot;tingle&quot; at startling news, especially of disaster (1Sa 3:11; 2Ki 21:12; Jer 19:3).(3) God&#x27;s ears are often mentioned in the anthropopathic style of Scripture, signifying the ability of God to receive the petitions of His people, for &quot;He that planted the ear, shall he not hear?&quot; (Ps 94:9 also Ps 10:17; 34:15; 130:2; Is 59:1; 1Pe 3:12). But God also hears the murmurings of the wicked against Him (Nu 11:1; 2Ki 19:28;  /APC Wis 1...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ur&#x27;-li (orthros, and related words; proi):The word generally refers to the day, and means the hour of dawn or soon after (Ge 19:2; 2Ch 36:15; Ho 6:4; Lu 24:22). Sometimes it refers to the beginning of the season, eg. the early rain (Ps 84:6; Jas 5:7; see RAIN). It may also have the sense of &quot;speedily&quot; (Ps 46:5). The early morning is frequently commended as the hour for prayer. See examples of Jesus (Mr 1:35; Lu 21:38; Joh 8:2); also Abraham (Ge 19:27), Jacob (Ge 28:18), Gideon (Jud 6:38), Samuel(1Sa 15:12), David (1Sa 17:20).G. H. Gerberding</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ur&#x27;-nest (arrhabon):Found three times in the New Testament: The &quot;earnest of our inheritance&quot; (Eph 1:14); &quot;the earnest of the Spirit&quot; (2Co 1:22; 5:5).It has an equivalent in Hebrew `erabhon (found in Ge 38:17,18,20), in Latin arrabo, French arrhes and the Old English arles. The term is mercantile and comes originally from the Phoenicians. Its general meaning is that of a pledge or token given as the assurance of the fulfillment of a bargain or promise. It also carries with it the idea of forfeit, such as is now common in land deals, only from the obverse side. In other words, the one promising to convey property, wages or blessing binds the promise with an advance gift or pledge partaking of the quality of the benefit to be bestowed. If the agreement be about wages, then a part of the wages is advanced; if it be about land, then a clod given to the purchaser or beneficiary may stand as the pledge of final and complete conveyance of the property.Figurative: In the spiritual sense, as used in the passages above named, the reference is to the work of the Spirit of God in our hearts being a token and pledge of a perfect redemption and a heavenly inheritance. There is more than the idea of security in the word as used, for it clearly implies the continuity and identity of the blessing.C. E. Schenk</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">er&#x27;-ring:An ornamental pendant of some kind hanging from the ears has been worn by both sexes in oriental lands from the earliest times. Among the Greeks and Romans, as with western peoples in general, its use was confined to females. The ears in the statue of the Medicean Venus are pierced and probably were originally ornamented with earrings. It is clear, however, that among the Hebrews and related oriental peoples earrings were worn by both sexes. Abraham&#x27;s servant &quot;put the earring upon (Rebekah&#x27;s) face, and the bracelets upon her hands&quot; (Ge 24:47 King James Version), in accordance with custom, evidently, but it is implied that it was customary for men also to wear earrings, in that the relatives and friends of Job &quot;every one (gave him) an earring of gold&quot;                 (Job 42:11 King James Version).Such ornaments were usually made of gold, finely wrought, and often set with precious stones, as archaeology has shown. Such jewels were worn in ancient times for protective as well as for decorative purposes. the Revised Version (British and American) renders &quot;amulets&quot; for the King James Version &quot;earrings&quot; in Isa 3:20, the Hebrew word (lechashim) being elsewhere associated with serpent-charming; but the earrings of Ge 35:4, also, were more than mere ornaments, so the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) may both be right in their renderings here (Kennedy). The influence of Egypt, where amulets of various kinds were worn by men and gods, by the living and the dead, is shown by recent excavations at Gezer, Taanach and Megiddo.See AMULET; ORNAMENT.George.

This is especially the case on relatively barren hills where there is little organic matter present to prevent reddening and give a more blackish tinge.&#x27;Adhamah (compare &#x27;adham, &quot;a man,&quot; and Adam) is from &#x27;adham, &quot;to be red,&quot; and is used in the senses: &quot;earth&quot; (Ex 20:24), &quot;land&quot; (Ps 105:35), a &quot;land&quot; or country (Isa 14:2), &quot;ground&quot; (Ge 4:11), &quot;the earth&quot; (Ge 7:4).The word most in use is &#x27;erets, undoubtedly from a most ancient root occurring in many languages, as English &quot;earth,&quot; German Erde, Arabic &#x27;ard. It is used in most of the senses of &#x27;adhamah, but less as &quot;soil&quot; and more as &quot;the earth&quot; as a part of the universe; frequently with shamayim, &quot;heavens,&quot; as in Ge 1:1: &quot;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&quot;`Aphar and its root word and derivatives are closely paralleled in the Arabic, and refer mainly to &quot;dust&quot; or &quot;dry earth&quot; (compare Arabic `afir, &quot;to be of the color of dust&quot;; `afar &quot;dust&quot;; ya`fur, &quot;a gazelle&quot;; Hebrew `opher, &quot;a gazelle&quot;). Compare Ge 2:7: &quot;Yahweh God formed man of the dust of the ground&quot;; Job 2:12: &quot;.... sprinkled dust upon their heads&quot;; Ps 104:29: &quot;.... they die, and return to their dust&quot;; Ge 18:27: &quot;dust and ashes.&quot;In the Septuagint and New Testament, ge is used in nearly all cases, oikoumene being used a few times for the &quot;habitable earth,&quot; as in Lu 21:26 the King James Version.See further ANTHROPOLOGY; ASTRONOMY; EVOLUTION; WORLD.Alfred Ely Day</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">The &quot;corners&quot; or &quot;ends&quot; of the earth are its &quot;wings&quot; (kanephoth ha-&#x27;arets), i.e. its borders or extremities. The word in general means a wing, because the wing of a bird is used as a covering for its young, and from this meaning it acquires that of the extremity of anything stretched out. It is thus used in De 22:12: &quot;Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four borders (wings) of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.&quot; It thus also means the coasts or boundaries of the land surface of the earth; its extremities. It is translated &quot;corners&quot; in Isa 11:12; &quot;ends&quot; in Job 37:3, 38:13. The &quot;four corners&quot; of the earth (Isa 11:12) or &quot;land&quot; (Eze 7:2) are therefore simply the extremities of the land in the four cardinal directions.See also ASTRONOMY, sec. III, 3.E.

A traveler in the interior of Palestine may still meet with the hospitality showed to David (2Sa 17:28). The generous natives brought not only gifts of food but the necessary vessels in which to cook it. An earthen vessel was used to preserve a land deed (Jer 32:14).Figurative: In Jer 19:1 breaking of an earthen vessel was symbolical of the destruction of Jerusalem.

The word epigeios is not found in Septuagint, but occurs in classical Greek from Plato down. In Plutarch Mor. 566 D, it occurs in the remarkable phrase, &quot;that which is earthly of the soul.&quot;Its meaning is primarily merely local (&quot;being on the earth&quot;). The word ge (&quot;earth&quot;) has not in itself an ethical significance, and does not carry a suggestion of moral taint, such as the word kosmos (&quot;world&quot;) has, especially in the Johannine writings, and sarx (&quot;flesh&quot;), especially in Paul. It does, however, suggest a certain limitation or frailty; and in some passages, the context gives the adjective epigeios an ethical color, though in the New Testament the purely local meaning is never lost sight of. It is translated &quot;earthly&quot; in the following passages:(1) Joh 3:12, &quot;if I told you earthly things,&quot; i.e. things which are realized on earth, things within the circle of human observation, truths of subjective experience (eg. the new birth); in contrast to &quot;heavenly things,&quot; the objective truths which, as not directly realizable in human experience, must be revealed from above (the mysteries of the Divine purpose and plans). Clearly &quot;earthly&quot; here implies no moral contrast to the heavenly or spiritual.(2) 2Co 5:1, &quot;the earthly house of our tabernacle,&quot; i.e. the body with which we are clothed on earth, in contrast to the spiritual resurrection-body, &quot;which is from heaven&quot; (verse 2). Here again the word has a merely local, not an ethical, significance.(3) Php 3:19, &quot;whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things,&quot; i.e. whose thoughts rest on earth, on the pleasures of life here below.(4) Jas 3:15, &quot;This wisdom is not a wisdom that cometh down from above, but is earthly,&quot; i.e. it is on the plane of life on earth, merely human, incapable of ascending to the level of Divine wisdom. In the last two passages, the literal local meaning is still evident, but the word shades off into the moral and suggests that which is opposed to the spiritual in character. The same word is translated &quot;terrestrial&quot; in 1Co 15:40, and &quot;things in (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;on&quot;) earth&quot; in Php 2:10 the King James Version has &quot;earthly&quot; in Joh 3:31, where it translates ek tes ges = literally, &quot;out of the earth,&quot; the reference being to the character and mission of the Baptist as partaking of the limitations of his earthly (human) origin, in contrast to the Messiah &quot;that cometh from heaven.&quot; The the King James Version rendering is somewhat misleading, for it introduces a confusion with the &quot;earthly&quot; of Joh 3:12 (see Westcott in the place cited.). The Revised Version (British and American) rightly renders &quot;of the earth.&quot;&quot;Earthly&quot; is to be distinguished from &quot;earthy&quot; = made of earth or clay (choikos, from chous, &quot;earth dug out,&quot; 1Co 15:47 ff).D.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">urth&#x27;-kwak (ra`ash; seismos):1. Earthquakes in Palestine: The last earthquake which worked any damage in Palestine and Syria occurred in 1837, and destroyed the village of Safed, near Mt. Hermon, and was felt even all the way to Hebron. Since that time a few feeble shocks have been felt but no damage was done. The region is just on the edge of the great earthquake circle whose center is in Armenia, and is liable to earthquakes. The large number of references in the Bible to earthquakes, and the evident fear in the minds of the people of those times, would seem to indicate that they were more frequent in Bible times than recently.2. Causes of Earthquakes: There are three main causes of earthquakes:(1) Earthslips. In the slow process of cooling, the crust of the earth tends to wrinkle and fold as it contracts. This causes a stress to be set up in the strata composing the crust. If the strata are too rigid to bend there must come after a time a break or fault. The shock caused by the break, which is usually several miles below the surface of the earth, is an earthquake, and it spreads in the form of earth waves from the break as center. Seismographs in all parts of the world are now adjusted to receive the waves even though the origin is on the opposite side of the earth.(2) Explosion of Steam or Gases under the Surface. Some earthquakes, especially those underneath the sea, are thought to be caused by water seeping through the soil and rocks and finding its way to the heated masses below. Steam is formed and if there is no escape for it, an explosion takes place whose force is felt on the surface.(3) Volcanic. As earthquakes are of common occurrence in volcanic regions it seems likely that there is some connection between the two, but the relation has not been fully traced. It may be that the second cause is the origin of both the volcano and earthquake.See further, DELUGE OF NOAH.3. Earthquakes in Jerusalem: Many destructive earthquakes have been recorded in the history of Syria, but they have been mostly in the north, in the region of Aleppo. Jerusalem itself has seldom been affected by earthquakes. The Hauran beyond the Jordan is covered with volcanic remains and signs of violent shocks, and the cities on the coast have suffered much, but Jerusalem on the higher ground between has usually escaped with little destruction.4. Earthquakes in Scripture: A number of earthquakes are mentioned in the Scriptures: (1) At Mount Sinai (Ex 19:18); (2) Korah and companions destroyed in fissure and sinking ground (Nu 16:31 Ant, IV, iii, 3); (3) in the Philistine camp in the days of Saul (1Sa 14:15); (4) after Elijah&#x27;s flight (1Ki 19:11); (5) in the reign of Uzziah, between 790 and 740 BC (Am 1:1); Zec 14:5 probably refers to the same (Ant., IX, x, 4); (6) at Christ&#x27;s death (Mt 27:51-54); (7) at Christ&#x27;s resurrection (Mt 28:2); (8) at Philippi when Paul and Silas were freed from prison (Ac 16:26). Most of these shocks seem to have been slight and caused little ...</p>

Frequent allusions are made also by various prophets to individuals or groups of individuals, as &quot;Woe to them that are at ease in Zion&quot; (Am 6:1); &quot;Rise up, ye women that are at ease&quot; (Isa 32:9), and &quot;Tremble, ye women that are at ease&quot; (Isa 32:11).The word in another form is used also in a verbal sense and to apply to physical ease and comfort, as &quot;My couch shall ease my complaint&quot; (Job 7:13 compare especially 2Ch 10:4,9). Simple mental tranquillity or peace of mind is also expressed by it (Jer 46:27).The single instance of its use in the New Testament is illustrative of its figurative but most common usage in the Old Testament, where it refers to moral indifference in the parable of the Rich Fool: &quot;Soul .... take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry&quot; (Lu 12:19).Walter G.

In the story of Gideon (Jud 6:3,13; 7:12; 8:10), we find several times the expression &quot;the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east.&quot; In Jud 8:24 it is said of the same host: &quot;For they Go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east. Their tents and had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.&quot; In Jer 49:28,29: &quot;Go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east. Their tents and their flocks shall they take.&quot; In Ge 25:6: &quot;But unto the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.&quot; Now Ishmael is the son of Abraham and Hagar, Midian of Abraham and Keturah, Kedar the son of Ishmael, and Amalek the grandson of Esau, dwelling in Edom. It is evident that we have to do with the Syrian desert and in a general way with Arabia, especially its northern part, and with peoples like the modern Bedouin who kept camels and dwelt in tents, &#x27;houses of hair&#x27; (buyut sha`r), as they are called by the Arabs of today.A striking passage is Ge 29:1: &quot;Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.&quot; As one journeys eastward through the country East of the Jordan he traverses first a region of towns and villages with fields of grain, and then the wide desert where the Bedouin wander with their herds. The line is a sharp one. Within a very few hours he passes from the settled part where the rain, though scanty, is sufficient to bring the grain to maturity, to the bare desert.Job was &quot;the greatest of all the children of the east&quot; (Job 1:3). These desert people had a name for wisdom as we see from 1Ki 4:30, &quot;Solomon&#x27;s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt&quot;; and from Mt 2:1: &quot;Now when Jesus was born .... Wisemen from the east came.&quot;Alfred Ely Day</p>

There is no trace of Easter celebration in the New Testament, though some would see an intimation of it in 1Co 5:7. The Jewish Christians in the early church continued to celebrate the Passover, regarding Christ as the true paschal lamb, and this naturally passed over into a commemoration of the death and resurrection of our Lord, or an Easter feast. This was preceded by a fast, which was considered by one party as ending at the hour of the crucifixion, i.e. at 3 o&#x27;clock on Friday, by another as continuing until the hour of the resurrection before dawn on Easter morning. Differences arose as to the time of the Easter celebration, the Jewish Christians naturally fixing it at the time of the Passover feast which was regulated by the paschal moon. According to this reckoning it began on the evening of the 14th day of the moon of the month of Nican without regard to the day of the week, while the GentileChristians identified it with the first day of the week, i.e. the Sunday of the resurrection, irrespective of the day of the month. This latter practice finally prevailed in the church, and those who followed the other reckoning were stigmatized as heretics. But differences arose as to the proper Sunday for the Easter celebration which led to long and bitter controversies. The Council of Nice, 325 AD, decreed that it should be on Sunday, but did not fix the particular Sunday. It was left to the bishop of Alexandria to determine, since that city was regarded as the authority in astronomical matters and he was to communicate the result of his determination to the other bishops.But this was not satisfactory, especially to the western churches, and a definite rule for the determination of Easter was needed. By some it was kept as early as March 21, and by others as late as April 25, and others followed dates between. The rule was finally adopted, in the 7th century, to celebrate Easter on the Sunday following the 14th day of the calendar moon which comes on, or after, the vernal equinox which was fixed for March 21. This is not always the astronomical moon, but near enough for practical purposes, and is determined without astronomical calculation by certain intricate rules adopted by ecclesiastical authority. These rules involve the Dominical Letters, or the first seven of the alphabet, representing the days of the week, A standing for the first day of the year and the one on which Sunday falls being called the Dominical for that year. There are also involved the Golden Numbers and the Epacts, the first being the ...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">e&#x27;-bal, (har `ebhal; Gaibal):Rises North of the vale of Shechem, over against Mt. Gerizim on the South. The mountain (Arabic el-Iclamiyeh) reaches a height of 1,402 ft. above the floor of the valley, and 3,077 ft. above the level of the Mediterranean. The Samaritans feign that Gerizim is the higher; but it is more than 200 ft. lower than Ebal. These two mountains overhang the pass through which runs the main artery of intercourse between East and West, the city of Nablus lying in the throat of the valley to the West. The ancient Shechem probably stood farther to the East. The lower slopes of Ebal as one ascends from Nablus are covered with gardens and orchards, the copious streams from the fountains under Gerizim washing its foot, and spreading fertility and beauty. The vine, the fig and the olive grow luxuriantly. Higher up we scramble over rough rocky terraces, where grow only the ubiquitous thistles and prickly shrubs.From the broad summit a view of surpassing interest and beauty rewards the climber&#x27;s toil. Westward beyond the hills and the plain of Sharon with its coast line of yellow sand running from Jaffa to Carmel, stretch the blue waters of the Mediterranean. From Carmel to Gilboa, Little Hermon and Tabor, roll the fruitful breadths of Esdraelon: the uplands of Galilee, with Nazareth showing on the brow above the plain, rise away to the buttresses of Lebanon in the North. From the snowy peak of Hermon the eye ranges over the Jaulan and Mount Gilead to the Mountain of Bashan in the East, with the steep eastern wall of the Jordan valley in the foreground. The land of Moab is visible beyond the Dead Sea; and the heights around Jerusalem close the view on the South.Round this splendid mountain, seen from afar on all sides, religious associations have gathered from old time. The Moslem Weley on the top--the usual white-domed sanctuary--where it is said the head of the Baptist is buried, is doubtless the modern representative of some ancient seat of worship. The ruins of a church show that Christians also came under the spell of the hill.The slopes of Ebal toward Gerizim played their part in that memorable scene, when, having conquered the central region of Palestine, Joshua led the people hither, erected an altar of unhewn stones, wrote upon the stones--either engraving on the stone itself, or impressing on plaster placed there for the purpose--a copy of the law, and then, as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded, placed half the tribes on the slope of Gerizim, and half on those of Ebal, and the ark with the priests and Levites in the center. Then with dramatic responses from the two divisions of the people, the blessings and the cursings of the law were read (Jos 8:30 ff; compare De 27:11 ff). In all the future, therefore, this mountain, towering aloft in the very heart of the land, would remind beholders far and near of their people&#x27;s covenant with God. It has sometimes been questioned if the reading of the law could be heard by the p...</p>

Organization of EbionitesV. EVIDENCE FROM EBIONISM FOR THE DOCTRINE OF THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH1. Christology of the Early Church 2. Paulinism of the Early ChurchLITERATUREGeneral Statement:The Ebionites were a sect of heretics frequently mentioned by the early Fathers. In regard to their opinions, as in regard to those of most early heretical sects, there is the difficulty that to a large extent we are dependent for our information on their opponents. These opponents were not generally very careful to apprehend exactly the views of those whose opinions they undertook to refute. It adds to the difficulty in the present case that there is a dubiety as to the persons designated by the title. Sometimes, it is admitted, the name was used to designate all Jewish Christians irrespective of their opinions; at other times it denotes a sect akin to the Gnostics, who ascribed a purely human origin to our Lord.There are, however, certain works, the Clementine writings, which from statements of the Fathers may be assumed to represent the views of this sect, but as these represent views to some extent divergent, it is difficult to decide which is the truly Ebionitic. There are also certain apocalyptic books which present affinities with Ebionism. The quotations from the Gospel according to the Hebrews--the only gospel the Ebionites received--likewise afford means of appreciating their views. This gospel has come down to us only in isolated quotations, for the accuracy of which we have no guarantee. Finally, it has to be borne in mind that no sect can persist through centuries of changing circumstances, and not in turn undergo change.I. Origin of the Name.1. The Poor Ones:Tertullian and Epiphanius assume the sect to have received its name from a certain Ebion or Hebion. Others of the Fathers, without affirming it, use language which seems to imply the belief in a person called Ebion. This, however, is generally now regarded as a mistake. No trace of the existence of such a person is to be found. The sect in question seems to have assumed the name Ebionites, &quot;the poor ones,&quot; from the first Beatitude (Mt 5:3), claiming to be the continuation into the new dispensation of the &quot;poor and needy&quot; of the Psalms, eg. psalm 69:33; 70:5; 74:21.It has been mooted that the sect may have had a leader who assumed the title the poor man. Besides that we have no trace of his existence, the name would almost certainly have been treated as an Aramaic word and put in the status emphaticus as Ebiona, which in Greek would ...</p>

While the significance of this statement is somewhat debatable, yet there is little doubt, as judged from his attitude and statement immediately following, that Pilate was endeavoring to appeal to the accusers&#x27; sympathies and to point out to them the manly qualities of Jesus. The ordinary punctuation which places an exclamation point after &quot;Behold&quot; and a period after &quot;the man&quot; is evidently incorrect if the grammatical structure in the Greek is to be observed, which gives to the second and third words the nominative form, and which therefore admits of a mild exclamation, and therefore of the emphasis upon &quot;the man.&quot; Some, however, hold the contrary view and maintain that the utterance was made in a spirit of contempt and ridicule, as much as to say, &quot;Behold here a mere man.&quot; See especially on this view Marcus Dods in Expositor&#x27;s Greek Testament. It would seem, however, that the former of the two views would be sustained by the chief facts in the case.Walter G. Clippinger</p>

Canonicity1. Structure of the Book:Reading this book one soon becomes aware that it is a discussion of certain difficult problems of human life. It begins with a title Ec (1:1), followed by a preface (1:2-11). It has a formal conclusion (12:8-13). Between the preface and the conclusion the body of the book is made up of materials of two kinds--first a series of &quot;I&quot; sections, sections uttered in the 1st person singular, a record of a personal experience; and second, an alternating series of gnomic sections, sections made up of proverbs (say 4:5,6,9-12; 5:1-12; 7:1-14,16-22; 8:1-8; 9:7-10; 10:1-4; 10:8-12:7). These may be called the &quot;thou&quot; sections, as most of them have the pronoun of the 2nd person singular. The idea of the vanity of all things characterizes the record of experience, but it also appears in the &quot;thou&quot; sections (eg. 9:9). On the other hand the proverb element is not wholly lacking in the &quot;I&quot; sections (eg. 4:1-3).2. The Contents:In the preface the speaker lays down the proposition that all things are unreal, and that the results of human effort are illusive Ec (1:2,3). Human generations, day and night, the wind, the streams, are alike the repetition of an unending round (1:4-7). The same holds in regard to all human study and thinking (1:8-11). The speaker shows familiarity with the phenomena which we think of as those of natural law, of the persistence of force, but he thinks of them in the main as monotonously limiting human experience. Nothing is new. All effort of Nature or of man is the doing again of something which has already been done.After the preface the speaker introduces himself, and recounts his experiences. At the outset he had a noble ambition for wisdom and discipline, but all he attained to was unreality and perplexity of mind (Ec 1:12-18). This is equally the meaning of the text, whether we translate &quot;vanity and vexation of spirit&quot; or &quot;vanity and a striving after wind,&quot; (&quot;emptiness, and struggling for breath&quot;), though the first of these two translations is the better grounded.Finding no adequate satisfaction in the pursuits of the scholar and thinker, taken by themselves, he seeks to combine these with the pursuit of agreeable sensations--alike those which come from luxury and those which come from activity and enterprise and achievement Ec (2:1-12). No one could be in better shape than he for making this experiment, but again he only attains to unreality and perplexity of spirit. He says to himself that at least it is in itself profitable to be a wise man rather than a fool, but his comfort is impaired by the fact that both alike are mortal (2:13-17). He finds little reassurance in the idea of laboring for the benefit of posterity; posterity i...</p>

But neither the Massoretic Text nor the Septuagint contained the word. Both the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American), however, insert the word on the authority of a few manuscripts. It has been suggested that it is the final `edh in Gal`edh, the name given by Laban and Jacob to the memorial heap of stones erected by them in the vicinity (Ge 31:47,48). According to the Massoretic Text, the name of the altar is the entire sentence: &quot;It is a witness between us that Yahweh is God.&quot; The opposition of the ten tribes to the erection of this altar was on the score that it was built after the pattern of the great altar of burnt offering (Jos 22:11,29), which was a horned altar forbidden in ordinary lay sacrifice. There is in it, therefore, no indication of a general opposition to lay sacrifices on altars of earth or unhewn stone (see Wiener, EPC, 198).George Frederick Weight</p>

Following are the references to Eden in the Bible, aside from those in Ge 2 and 3: Ge 4:16; Isa 51:3; Eze 28:13; 31:9,16,18; 36:35; Joe 2:3. The Garden of Eden is said to be &quot;eastward, in Eden&quot; Ge (2:8); where the vegetation was luxurious (2:9) and the fig tree indigenous (3:7), and where it was watered by irrigation.All kinds of animals, including cattle, beasts of the field and birds, were found there (2:19,20). Moreover, the climate was such that clothing was not needed for warmth. It is not surprising, therefore, that the plural of the word has the meaning &quot;delights,&quot; and that Eden has been supposed to mean the land of delights, and that the word became a synonym for Paradise.The location of Eden is in part to be determined from the description already given. It must be where there is a climate adapted to the production of fruit trees and of animals capable of domestication, and in general to the existence of man in his primitive condition. In particular, its location is supposed to be determined by the statements regarding the rivers coursing through it and surrounding it. There is a river (nahar) (Ge 2:10) which was parted and became four heads (ro&#x27;shim), a word which (Jud 8:16; Job 1:17) designates main detachments into which an army is divided, and therefore would more properly signify branches than heads, permitting Josephus and others to interpret the river as referring to the ocean, which by the Greeks was spoken of as the river (okeanos) surrounding the world. According to Josephus, the Ganges, the Tigris, the Euphrates and the Nile are the four rivers, being but branches of this one river. Moreover, it is contended by some, with much show of reason, that the word perath translated Euphrates is a more general term, signifying &quot;the broad&quot; or &quot;deep&quot; river, and so may here refer to some other stream than the Euphrates, possibly to a river in some other region whose name is perpetuated in the present Euphrates, as &quot;the Thames&quot; of New England perpetuates the memory of the Thames of Old England. In ancient times there was a river Phrath in Persia, and perhaps two. It is doubtful whether the phrase &quot;eastward, in Eden&quot; refers to the position with reference to the writer or simply with reference to Eden itself. So far as that phrase is concerned, therefore, speculation is left free to range over the whole earth, and this it has done.1. Central Asia:Columbus when passing the mouth of the Orinoco surmised that its waters came down from the Garden of Eden. It is fair to say, however, that he supposed himself to be upon the East coast of Asia. The traditions of its location somewhere in Central Asia are numerous and persistent.

After Rachel died and was buried &quot;in the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem) .... Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder&quot; (Ge 35:19,21). In Ge 35:27 he is described as proceeding to Hebron. This &quot;tower of the flock,&quot; which may have been only a tower and no town, must therefore be looked for between Bethlehem and Hebron. Jerome says that it was one Roman mile from Bethlehem. In the Septuagint, however, 35:16 and 21 are transposed, which suggests that there may have been a tradition that Migdal Eder was between Bethel and Bethlehem. There must have been many such towers for guarding flocks against robbers. Compare &quot;tower of the watchman&quot; (2Ki 18:8, etc.). The phrase &quot;Migdal Eder&quot; occurs in Mic 4:8 where Jerusalem is compared to such a tower.E. W. G. Masterman</p>

Boundaries:The boundaries of Edom may be traced with some approach to accuracy. On the East of the `Arabah the northern border ran from the Dead Sea, and was marked by Wady el-Kurachi, or Wady el-Chasa. On the East it marched with the desert. The southern border ran by Elath and Ezion-geber (De 2:8). On the West of the `Arabah the north boundary of Edom is determined by the south border of Israel, as indicated in Nu 34:3 f: a line running from the Salt Sea southward of the Ascent of Akrabbim to Zin and Kadesh-barnea. This last, we are told, lay in the &quot;uttermost&quot; of the border of Edom (Nu 20:16). The line may be generally indicated by the course of Wady el-Fiqrah. How much of the uplands West of the `Arabah southward to the Gulf of `Aqaba was included in Edom it is impossible to say.2. Character and Features:The land thus indicated varies greatly in character and features. South of the Dead Sea in the bottom of the valley we have first the stretch of salt marsh land called es-Sebkha; then, beyond the line of white cliffs that crosses the valley diagonally from Northwest to Southeast, a broad depression strewn with stones and sandhills, the debris of an old sea bottom, rises gradually, and 60 miles to the South reaches a height of about 700 ft. above the level of the Red Sea, 2,000 ft. above that of the Dead Sea. From this point it sinks until it reaches the shore of the Gulf of `Aqaba, 45 miles farther South. The whole depression is known today as Wady el-`Arabah (compare Hebrew ha-`arabhah, De 2:8 the Revised Version (British and American), etc.). On either side the mountains rise steeply from the valley, their edges carved into many fantastic shapes by the deep wadys that break down from the interior (see ARABAH). The northern part of the plateau on the West forms the spacious grazing ground of the `Azdzimeh Arabs. The mountains rise to a height of from about 1,500 ft. to a little over 2,000 ft. This district was traversed by the ancient caravan road to South Palestine; and along the eastern side traces of the former civilization are still to be seen. The desert region to the South is higher, reaching to as much as 2,600 ft. The mountain range East of the `Arabah is generally higher in the South than in the North. Jebel Harun beside Petra, is 4,780 ft. above sea-level; while East of `Aqaba, Jebel el-Chisma may be as much as 5,900 ft. in height.Limestone, porphyry and Nubian sandstone are the prevailing formation; but volcanic rocks are also found. The range consists mainly of rough rocky heights with many almost inaccessible peaks separated by deep gorges. But there are also breadths of fertile land where wheat, grapes, figs, pomegranates and olives are grown to advantage. The northern district is known today by the name el-Jebal, corresponding to the ancient Gebal. Seir is the name applied to the eastern range in Ge 36:8; De 2:1,5; 2Ch 20:23. It is also called Edom, and the Mount of Esau (Ob 1:8 f). Se...</p>

The most probable identification is with Der`ah, a town of between 4,000 and 5,000 inhabitants, on the southern lip of Wady Zeideh, about 29 miles as the crow flies East of the Sea of Galilee. It is the center of an exceedingly fruitful district. The accumulated rubbish in the town covers many remains of antiquity. It is, however, chiefly remarkable for the extraordinary subterranean city, as yet only partially explored, cut in the rock under the town. This is certainly very ancient, and was doubtless used by the inhabitants as a refuge in times of stress and peril.

Education Defined.By education we understand the sum total of those processes whereby society transmits from one generation to the next its accumulated social, intellectual and religious experience and heritage. In part these processes are informal and incidental, arising from participation in certain forms of social life and activity which exist on their own account and not for the sake of their educative influence upon the rising generation. The more formal educative processes are designed(1) to give the immature members of society a mastery over the symbols and technique of civilization, including language (reading and writing), the arts, the sciences, and religion, and(2) to enlarge the fund of individual and community knowledge beyond the measure furnished by the direct activities of the immediate environment (compare Dewey, article on &quot;Education&quot; in Monroe&#x27;s CE; compare Butler, ME).Religious education among ancient and modern peoples alike reveals clearly this twofold aspect of all education. On its informal side it consists in the transmission of religious ideas and experience by means of the reciprocal processes of imitation and example; each generation, by actually participating in the religious activities and ceremonies of the social group, imbibing as it were the spirit and ideals of the preceding generation as these are modified by the particular economic and industrial conditions under which the entire process takes place. Formal religious education begins with the conscious and systematic effort on the part of the mature members of a social group (tribe, nation, or religious fellowship) to initiate the immature members by means of solemn rites and ceremonies, or patient training, or both, into the mysteries and high privileges of their own religious fellowship and experience. As regards both the content and form of this instruction, these will in every case be determined by the type and stage of civilization reflected in the life, occupations, habits and customs of the people. Among primitive races educational method is simpler and the content of formal instruction less differentiated than on higher culture levels (Ames, PRE). All education is at first religious in the sense that religious motives and ideas predominate in the educational efforts of all primitive peoples. The degree to which religion continues preeminent in the educational s...</p>

The fertile egg of a bird consists of the yolk, a small disk from which the embryo develops, the albuminous white, and a calcareous shell. The most ancient records prove that eggs have been used as an article of diet ever since the use of the flesh of fowl began. Chickens were unknown in Palestine in the days of Job, so that his query concerning the taste of the white of an egg might have referred to those of pigeons, ducks, eggs taken from the nests of geese or swans, game birds or ostriches. &quot;Can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?&quot; (Job 6:6, the Revised Version, margin &quot;the juice of purslain&quot;). In Lu 11:12 there is every possibility that the egg of our common domestic fowl is referred to as &quot;chickens&quot; (which see) had been imported and were numerous in Palestine at that time. &quot;Or if he shall ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion?&quot; The reference in Isa 59:5 is to the egg of a serpent, and is figurative of the schemes of evil men: &quot;They hatch adders&#x27; eggs, and weave the spider&#x27;s web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth; and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.&quot;Gene Stratton-Porter</p>

Joshua passed from Libnah to Lachish, and from Lachish to Eglon on his way to Hebron (10:31 ff). It was in the Shephelah of Judah (15:39). The name seems to be preserved in that of Khirbet `Ajlan, about 10 miles West of Beit Jibrin. Professor Petrie, however, thinks that the site of Tell Nejileh better suits the requirements. While Khirbet `Ajlan is a comparatively modern site, the city at Tell Nejileh must have been contemporary with that at Tell el-Chesy (Lachish). It lies fully three miles Southeast of Tell el-Chesy.W.

This dualism, however, has been denied by some.I. The Country.1. The Basis of the Land:Though Egypt is one of the earliest countries in recorded history, and as regards its continuous civilization, yet it is a late country in its geological history and in its occupation by a settled population. The whole land up to Silsileh is a thick mass of Eocene limestone, with later marls over that in the lower districts. It has been elevated on the East, up to the mountains of igneous rocks many thousand feet high toward the Red Sea. It has been depressed on the West, down to the Fayum and the oases below sea-level. This strain resulted in a deep fault from North to South for some hundreds of miles up from the Mediterranean. This fault left its eastern side about 200 ft. above its western, and into it the drainage of the plateau poured, widening it out so as to form the Nile valley, as the permanent drain of Northeast Africa. The access of water to the rift seems to have caused the basalt outflows, which are seen as black columnar basalt South of the Fayum, and brown massive basalt at Khankah, North of Cairo.2. The Nile Valley:The gouging out of the Nile valley by rainfall must have continued when the land was 300 ft. higher than at present, as is shown by the immense fails of strata into collapsed caverns which were far below the present Nile level. Then, after the excavations of the valley, it has been submerged to 500 ft. lower than at present, as is shown by the rolled gravel beds and deposits on the tops of the water-worn cliffs, and the filling up of the tributary valleys--as at Thebes--by deep deposits, through which the subsequent stream beds have been scoured out. The land still had the Nile sourc...</p>

It was not subdued by Joshua (13:3) but was allotted, in the division of the land, first to Judah and then to Da (Jos 15:11,45,46; 19:43). It was taken by Judah (Jud 1:18). The people of Ekron are prominent in the story of the ark in the land of the Philistines. It was they who proposed to have it sent back to Israel (1Sa 5:10; 6:16,17). After the defeat of the Philistines, when David killed Goliath, the Israelites pursued them to the gates of Ekron, which was evidently the nearest walled town in which the fugitives could take refuge (1Sa 17:52). It was the seat of the worship of the god Baalzebub, as appears in the account of the sickness and death of Ahaziah (2Ki 1:2,3,6:16). It is included among other cities in the denunciations of Amos (1:8) and of Jeremiah (25:20). Zephaniah declares that it shall be rooted up (2:4), and Zechariah speaks of its consternation at the fall of Tyre (9:5,7).From the Assyrian records we learn that it revolted against Sennacherib and expelled Padi, the governor he had placed over it, and sent him to Hezekiah, at Jerusalem, for safe keeping. Sennacherib marched against it and Ekron called in the aid of the king of Mutsri, formerly supposed to be Egypt but now regarded by some scholars as a district of Northwestern Arabia. Sennacherib raised the siege of Ekron to defeat this army, which he did at Eltekeh, and then returned and took the city by storm and put to death the leaders of the revolt and carried their adherents into captivity. He then compelled Hezekiah to restore Padi, who was once more made governor. This affair led to the famous attack of Sennacherib on Hezekiah and Jerusalem (Rawl., Anc. Mon., II, 159). Ekron is mentioned in 1 Macc 10:89 as being given by Alexander Balas to Jonathan Maccabeus, and it appears in the accounts of the first Crusade.Ekronite:An inhabitant of Ekron, used in plural in Jos 13:3 and 1Sa 5:10.H.

This unusual combination of names has given occasion for much speculation and for various text emendations. Already the Septuagint sought to meet the difficulty by reading wa-yiqra&#x27; &#x27;el &#x27;elohe yisra&#x27;el, &quot;and he called upon the God of Israel,&quot; instead of the wa-yiqra&#x27; lo &#x27;el of Massoretic Text, &quot;and he called it El&quot; etc. Wellhausen, followed by Dillmann, Driver and others, changes &quot;altar&quot; to &quot;pillar,&quot; because the Hebrew verb, hitstsibh, is used with mitstsbhah, &quot;pillar,&quot; in Ge 35:14,20, so making this religious act a parallel to that at Bethel. But Delitzsch, New Commentary on Genesis, properly rejects this purely fanciful change, and understands the compound name as the altar&#x27;s inscription. Dillmann well suggests that &quot;altar&quot; (or &quot;pillar&quot;) be supplied, reading thus: &quot;called it the altar of El, the God of Israel.&quot; The peculiar phrase is best and most readily understood in its close connection with the struggle at Peniel, recorded in Ge 32. Being victorious in that struggle, Jacob received the new name &quot;Israel&quot;; and to his first altar in Palestine he gave that name of God which appeared in his own new name, further explaining it by the appositive phrase &quot;Elohe-Israel.&quot; Thus, his altar was called, or dedicated to, &quot;El, the God of Israel.&quot;Edward Mack</p>

The statement that he came to the throne in the 26th year of Asa, reigned two years, and died in the 27th year of Asa, illustrates the Hebrew method of synchronizing the reigns of the kings of Israel and Judah (compare 1Ki 15:33; 16:8). Elah appears to have been a debauchee. While he was drinking himself drunk in the house of Azra, his chamberlain, Zimri, one of his military leaders, conspired against him and murdered him. According to Josephus (VIII, xii, 4) he took advantage of the absence of the army, which was at Gibbethon, to kill Elah. The extirpation of the royal family followed the murder of the king. Baasha&#x27;s dynasty had its origin in a murder and it ended in a murder. The government had no stability.

Commencing near Hebron, close to Beit Sur, it descends under the name Wady es Sur in a more or less northerly direction until near Beit Nettif where it turns abruptly west and receives the name Wady ec CunT. Here it is joined by the Wady en Najil, coming from the North, and from the East by the Wady el-Jindy, down which descends an ancient road from Bethlehem.

Codex Sinaiticus &#x27;the original scribe&#x27; reads Elam)The scene of the events of 1Sa 17:2 ff, referred to also in 1Sa 21:9. There can be no doubt that this is the Wady ec CunT (&quot;valley of the tercbinth&quot;), or part of it. This is the southernmost of the great valleys which cut through the Shephelah. Commencing near Hebron, close to Beit Sur, it descends under the name Wady es Sur in a more or less northerly direction until near Beit Nettif where it turns abruptly west and receives the name Wady ec CunT. Here it is joined by the Wady en Najil, coming from the North, and from the East by the Wady el-Jindy, down which descends an ancient road from Bethlehem. Where all these valleys coalesce the Wady ec CunT expands into a wide and level bottom, half a mile across.

It is named along with Ezion-geber in the account of Israel&#x27;s journey round the land of Edom (De 2:8). It appears as Ailath, and Alion in the Septuagint, and in Josephus as Ilanis (Ant., VIII, vi, 4), while Eusebius (Onomasticon) has Aila. From this we may gather that the Aramaic Ilan or Ilana was in use as well as the Hebrew &#x27;elath or &#x27;eloth. The name, &quot;grove,&quot; was doubtless derived from the presence of certain sacred trees. It may be identical with El-paran of Ge 14:6, and Elah of Ge 36:41. When David conquered Edom, Elath passed into the hands of Israel (2Sa 8:14). It was a position of great importance in connection with the trade with South Arabia. Here the merchant fleets of Solomon and Jehoshaphat were fitted out, and hence, they sailed (1Ki 9:26; 2Ch 8:17; 1Ki 22:48).In the reign of Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, Edom shook off the hand of Judah (2Ki 8:20), but under Amaziah and Uzziah it was again subdued (2Ki 14:7,10,22). Finally it was taken from Ahaz by Rezin, king of Syria. The Jews were driven out and the Syrians (Edomites?) took permanent possession (2Ki 16:6). It is identical with the modern `Aqaba, at the head of the gulf of that name.W. Ewing</p>

In the King James Version the names are given as Eldad and Medad; meaning &quot;God has loved&quot; (&quot;God loves&quot;) and &quot;object of love&quot; (?).They were two of the seventy elders chosen by Moses (Nu 11:26), and while the others obeyed the summons and went to the tabernacle, these two remained in the camp and prophesied (Nu 11:26). The nature of their prophecy is not recorded, and this naturally became a good subject for the play of the imagination. It furnished the basis for a lost work which was quoted by Hermas (Vis 2 3): &quot;The Lord is near to them who return unto him, as it is written in Eldad and Modad, who prophesied to the people in the wilderness.&quot; The Palestine Targums also filled in the subject of the prophecy of Eldad and Modad, and, as they have it, it related to the coming of Gog and Magog against Israel at the end of the days. One of the Targums has the expression, &quot;The Lord is near to them that are in the hour of tribulation.&quot; The authors of the Targums were either dependent upon that work or upon a similar tradition; and the former of these views is the more probable. Lightfoot and Holtzman think the lengthy quotation in 1 Clem 23 and 2 Clem 11 is from the Book of Eldad and Modad. The work is found in the Stichometry of Nicephorus and consists of 400 stichoi, which would make it about twice the length of the Cant.A. W. Fortune</p>

From the references in Ac 14:23; 20:17 it may be inferred that the churches generally had elders appointed over them. That &quot;elders&quot; and &quot;bishops&quot; were in apostolic and sub-apostolic times the same, is now almost universally admitted; in all New Testament references their functions are identical. The most probable explanation of the difference of names is that &quot;elder&quot; refers mainly to the person, and &quot;bishop&quot; to the office; the name &quot;elder&quot; emphasizes what he is, while &quot;bishop,&quot; that is &quot;overseer,&quot; emphasizes what the elder or presbyter does.See BISHOP; CHURCH GOVERNMENT; MINISTRY.A.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">el&#x27;-der, (zaqen):Among primitive peoples authority seems naturally to be invested in those who by virtue of greater age and, consequently, experience are best fitted to govern thus Iliad iii.149. Later the idea of age became merged in that of dignity (Il. ii.404, ii.570; Odyssey ii.14). In like manner the word patres came to be used among the Romans (Cic. Rep. 2,8,14). So also among the Germans authority was entrusted to those who were older; compare Tacitus Agricola. The same is true among the Arabians to the present day, the sheik being always a man of age as well as of authority.From the first the Hebrews held this view of government, although the term &quot;elder&quot; came later to be used of the idea of the authority for which, at first, age was regarded necessary. Thus the office appears in both the Jahwist, J (9th century BC) (Ex 3:16; 12:21; 24:1, of the elders of the Hebrews; and of the Egyptians, Ge 50:7); and Elohist (E) (8th century BC) (Ex 17:5; 18:12; 19:7 (the second Deuteronomist (D2)); Jos 24:31, elders of Israel, or of the people. Compare the principle of selection of heads of tens, fifties, etc., Ex 18:13 ff, seventy being selected from a previous body of elders); compare Jahwist(J)-Elohist(E) (Nu 11:16,24). Seventy are also mentioned in Ex 24:1, while in Jud 8:14 seventy-seven are mentioned, although this might be taken to include seven princes. Probably the number was not uniform.Elder as a title continues to have place down through the times of the Judges (Jud 8:16; 2:7); compare Ru 4:2 ff into the kingdom. Saul asked to be honored before the elders (1Sa 15:30); the elders of Bethlehem appeared before Samuel (1Sa 16:4); the elders appeared before David in Hebron (2Sa 17:15; 1Ch 11:3); elders took part in the temple procession of Solomon (1Ki 8:3; 2Ch 5:4). They continued through the Persian period Ezr 5:5,9; 6:7,14; 10:8,14; Joe 1:14 margin and the Maccabean period APC Judith 6:16; 7:23; 8:10; 10:6; 13:12; 1Macc 12:35, while the New Testament presbuteros, Mt 16:21; 26:47,57; Mr 8:31; Lu 9:22; Ac 4:5,23 makes frequent mention of the office.The elders served as local magistrates, in bringing murderers to trial (De 19:12; 21:1 ff; Jos 20:4), punishing a disobedient son (De 21:19), inflicting penalty for slander (De 22:15), for noncompliance with the Levirate marriage law (De 25:7 ff), enforcing the Law (De 27:1), conducting the service in expiation of unwitting violation of the Law (Le 4:13 ff).In certain passages different classes of officers are mentioned as &quot;judges and officers&quot; (De 16:18), &quot;elders&quot; and &quot;officers&quot; (De 31:28), &quot;heads, tribes, elders officers&quot; (De 29:10; Hebrew 9). It is probable that both classes were selected from among the elders, and that to one class was assigned the work of judging, and that the &quot;officers&quot; exercised executive functions (Schurer). In entirely Jewish communities the same men would be both officers of the community and elders of the synagogue. In this case the same men would have jurisdiction over c...</p>

With his father and 3 brothers he was consecrated to the priest&#x27;s office (Ex 28:1). After the destruction of Nadab and Abihu, he occupied a more important position, and he and Ithamar &quot;ministered in the priest&#x27;s office in the presence of Aaron their father&quot; (Le 10:6 f; Nu 3:4; 1Ch 24:2 ff). He was given the oversight of the Levites and had charge of the tabernacle and all within it (Nu 3:32; 4:16). To Eleazar fell the duty of beating out for an altar covering the censers of Korah and his fellow-conspirators who had attempted to seize the priesthood (Nu 16:37,39). On the death of Aaron, Eleazar succeeded him (Nu 20:25 ff). He assisted Moses with the census after the plague in the plains of Moab (Nu 26:1 ff), and with Moses and the elders heard the petition of the daughters of Zelophehad who wished to be served as heirs to their father (Nu 27:1 ff). After the entrance into Canaan, Eleazar and Joshua gave effect to the decision arrived at by giving the daughters of Zelophehad a share in the land of Manasseh (Jos 17:4). He was priest and adviser to Joshua, the successor of Moses (Nu 27:19; 31:12 ff), whom he also assisted in partitioning Canaan among the tribes (Nu 34:17; Jos 14:1; 19:51; 21:1). He was buried in the hill (the Revised Version, margin &quot;Gibeah&quot;) of Phinehas his son in the hill country of Ephraim (Jos 24:33). For some reason unknown the descendants of Ithamar seem to have held the chief position among the priests from Eli till the accession of Solomon, when Abiathar was sent into retirement, and Zadok, the descendant of Eleazar, was appointed in his place (1Ki 2:26 ff).

It means properly an object or objects of selection.This primary meaning sometimes passes into that of &quot;eminent,&quot; &quot;valuable,&quot; &quot;choice&quot;; often thus as a fact, in places where the King James Version uses &quot;chosen&quot; (or &quot;elect&quot;) to translate the original (eg. Isa 42:1; 1Pe 2:6). In the King James Version &quot;elect&quot; (or &quot;chosen&quot;) is used of Israel as the race selected for special favor and to be the special vehicle of Divine purposes (so 4 times in Apocrypha, Tobit and Ecclus); of the great Servant of Yahweh (compare Lu 23:35; the &quot;Christ of God, his chosen&quot;); compare eminent saints as Jacob, Moses, Rufus (Ro 16:13); &quot;the lady,&quot; and her &quot;sister&quot; of 2 Jn; of the holy angels (1Ti 5:21); with a possible suggestion of the lapse of other angels. Otherwise, and prevalently in the New Testament, it denotes a human community, also described as believers, saints, the Israel of God; regarded as in some sense selected by Him from among men, objects of His special favor, and correspondingly called to special holiness and service.See further under ELECTION. In the English versions &quot;elect&quot; is not used as a verb: &quot;to choose&quot; is preferred; eg. Mr 13:20; Eph 1:4.Handley Dunelm</p>

Dr. Rendel Harris believes this question to be settled by the discovery in the papyri of numerous instances which prove that kurios and kuria were used by ancient letter-writers as terms of familiar endearment, applicable to brother, sister, son, wife, or intimate friend of either sex (Expositor, March, 1901; see also Findlay, Fellowship in the Life Eternal, chapter iii). In the light of this suggestion we should naturally translate, &quot;to my (dear) lady Eklekte.&quot;Grammatically, this is strongly supported by 1Ti 1:2 and 2Ti 1:2 (Timotheo gnesio .... agapeto .... tekno = &quot;to Tim othy my true .... beloved .... child&quot;); and the fact that the name Eklekte has not yet been discovered, though Eklektos has, offers no grave objection. This is the translation favored by Clement of Alexandria, who says of the epistle: scripta vero est ad quandam Babyloniam nomine Electam, significat autem electionem ecclesiae sanctae (&quot;It is written to a certain Babylonian, Electa by name; but it signifies the further election of the holy church&quot;). It seems doubtful whether he means by the last clause that Electa is simply a personification of the church, or a real person whose name was derived from the Christian idea of election. Either way the rendering, &quot;to the lady Electa,&quot; is suitable, and upon the whole it seems the best. Eklekte is not an adjective but a noun. If a person is intended, it is &quot;the lady Electa&quot;; if a church, it is designated, not &quot;the elect Lady,&quot; but &quot;the lady Elect.&quot; The mention of &quot;thy elect sister&quot; in 2 Joh 1:13 does not hinder either supposition.See further CYRIA; JOHN, THE EPISTLES OF.

CONSIDERATIONS IN RELIEF OF THOUGHT1. Antinomies 2. Fatalism Another Thing 3. The Moral Aspects 4. &quot;We know in Part&quot; 5. The Unknown FutureI. The Word in Scripture.The word is absent from the Old Testament, where the related Hebrew verb (bachar) is frequent. In the New Testament it occurs 6 times (Ro 9:11; 11:5,7,28; 1Th 1:4; 2Pe 1:10). In all these places it appears to denote an act of Divine selection taking effect upon human objects so as to bring them into special and saving relations with God: a selection such as to be at once a mysterious thing, transcending human analysis of its motives (so eminently in Ro 9:11), and such as to be knowable by its objects, who are (2 Pet) exhorted to &quot;make it sure,&quot; certain, a fact to consciousness. It is always (with one exception, Ro 9:11; see below) related to a community, and thus has close affinity with the Old Testament teachings upon the privileged position of Israel as the chosen, selected race (see under ELECT). The objects of election in the New Testament are, in effect, the Israel of God, the new, regenerate race called to special privilege and special service. From one point of view, that of the external marks of Christianity, they may thus be described as the Christian community in its widest sense, the sense in which the sacramental position and the real are prima facie assumed to coincide. But from 2 Peter it is manifest that much more than this has to be said if the incidence of the word present to the writer&#x27;s mind is to be rightly felt. It is assumed there that the Christian, baptized and a worshipper, may yet need to make &quot;sure&quot; his &quot;calling and election&quot; as a fact to his consciousness. This implies conditions in the &quot;election&quot; which far transcend the tests of sacred rite and external fellowship.II. The Mysterious Element.Such impressions of depth and mystery in the word are confirmed by the other, passages. In Ro 9:11 the context is charged with the most urgent and even staggering challenges to submission and silence in the presence of the inscrutable. To illustrate large assertions as to the liberty and sovereignty of the Divine dealings with man, the apostle brings in Esau and Jacob, individuals, twins as yet unborn, and points to the inscrutable difference of the Divine action toward them as such. Somehow, as a matter of fact, the Eternal appears as appointing to unborn Esau a future of comparative disfavor and to Jacob of favor; a future announced to the still pregnant mother. Such discrimination was made and announced, says the apostle, &quot;that the purpose of God according to election might stand.&quot; In the whole passage the gravest stress is laid upon the isolation of the &quot;election&quot; from the merit or demerit of its objects.III. ...</p>

The definite article used serves to designate them as a distinct and definite group whose integrity was not destroyed by the loss of one of the twelve. The college of &quot;the Twelve&quot; had come to be so well recognized that the gospel writers all used on occasions the word with the definite article to represent the Twelve Apostles chosen by Jesus. This custom still remained and the numeral merely changed, as, &quot;Afterward he was manifested unto the eleven&quot; (Mr 16:14; compare Lu 24:9,33; Ac 2:14). On the other hand, however, the substantive is also sometimes used, as &quot;The eleven disciples went into Galilee&quot; (Mt 28:16; compare also Ac 1:26). As an illustration of the fixedness of usage, Paul refers to the eleven as &quot;the twelve&quot; when he recounts the appearances of Jesus after His resurrection: &quot;And that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve&quot; (1Co 15:5).Walter G.

There is a discrepancy between 2Sa 21:19 and 1Ch 20:5. In the former passage we read, &quot;And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan, the son of Jaare-oregim the Beth-lehemite, slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver&#x27;s beam&quot;; while in the latter we are told, &quot;And there was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver&#x27;s beam.&quot; Most modern critics prefer as the original text of the latter part of the two discrepant statements the following: &quot;and Elhanan the son of Jair the Beth-lehemite slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver&#x27;s beam.&quot; It is contended that the Chronicler slightly modified the text before him, in order to bring it into harmony with 1Sa 17, where David is said to have slain a Philistine giant Goliath. There is almost unanimous agreement that &quot;Jaare-oregim&quot; is a corrupt reading, and the &quot;Jair&quot; in 1Ch is to be preferred. From Jerome to the present some scholars identify Elhanan with David, and thus remove the discrepancy. Ewald ( Hist, III, 70) argued that the name &quot;Goliath&quot; was inserted in 1Sa 17 and 21 by the narrators whose compositions are embodied in Samuel, Elhanan being the real victor over Goliath, while David&#x27;s antagonist was simply called &quot;the Philistine.&quot;(2) The son of Dodo of Bethlehem, one of David&#x27;s mighty men (2Sa 23:24; 1Ch 11:26). Some moderns think that there was only one Elhanan, and that he was the son of Dodo of the clan of Jair.John Richard Sampey</p>

For the first time in Israel, Eli combined in his own person the functions of high priest and judge, judging Israel for 40 years (1Sa 4:18). The incidents in Eli&#x27;s life are few; indeed, the main interest of the narrative is in the other characters who are associated with him. The chief interest centers in Samuel. In Eli&#x27;s first interview with Hannah (1Sa 1:12 ff), she is the central figure; in the second interview (1Sa 1:24 ff), it is the child Samuel. When Eli next appears, it is as the father of Hophni and Phinehas, whose worthless and licentious lives had profaned their priestly office, and earned for them the title &quot;men of Belial&quot; (or &quot;worthlessness&quot;).Eli administered no stern rebuke to his sons, but only a gentle chiding of their greed and immorality. Thereafter he was warned by a nameless prophet of the downfall of his house, and of the death of his two sons in one day (1Sa 2:27-36), a message later confirmed by Samuel, who had received this word directly from Yahweh Himself (1Sa 3:11 ff). The prophecy was not long in fulfillment. During the next invasion by the Philistines, the Israelites were utterly routed, the ark of God was captured, and Hophni and Phinehas were both slain. When the news reached Eli, he was so overcome that he &quot;fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck brake, and he died&quot; (1Sa 4:18). The character of Eli, while sincere and devout, seems to have been entirely lacking in firmness. He appears from the history to have been a good man, full of humility and gentleness, but weak and indulgent. His is not a strong personality; he is always overshadowed by some more commanding or interesting figure.A. C. Grant</p>

The functions of his office are seen from the oracle of Isaiah in which Shebna is deposed and Eliakim set in his place (Isa 22:15 ff). He is the &quot;treasurer&quot; (the Revised Version, margin &quot;steward&quot;), and is &quot;over the house&quot; (Isa 22:15).At his installation he is clothed with a robe and girdle, the insignia of his office, and, having the government committed into his hand, is the &quot;father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah&quot; (Isa 22:21). The key of the house of David is laid on his shoulder, and he alone has power to open and shut, this being symbolic of his absolute authority as the king&#x27;s representative (Isa 22:22).One of Solomon&#x27;s officials is the first mentioned as occupying this position (1Ki 4:6), and this office was continued in both the Northern and Southern Kingdom (1Ki 16:9; 18:3; 2Ki 10:5; 15:5). Its importance is seen from the fact that after Azariah was smitten with leprosy, Jotham his heir &quot;was over the household, judging the people of the land&quot; (2Ki 15:5).When Sennacherib sent an army against Jerusalem in 701, Eliskim was one of these Jewish princes who held on behalf of Hezekiah a parley with the Assyrian officers (2Ki 18:18,26,37; Isa 36:3,11,22). As a result of the invader&#x27;s threats, he was sent by Hezekiah in sackcloth to Isaiah, entreating his prayers to Yahweh on behalf of Jerusalem (2Ki 19:2; Isa 37:2).(2) The original name of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, whom Pharaoh-necoh made king of Judah (2Ki 23:34; 2Ch 36:4).(3) A priest who assisted at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, rebuilt after his return from Babylon (Ne 12:41).(4) A grandson of Zerubbabel and ancestor of Jesus (Mt 1:13).(5) An ancestor of Jesus (Lu 3:30).S.

He is of the tribe of Buz (compare Ge 22:21), a brother-tribe to that of Uz, and of the family of Ram, or Aram, that is, an Aramean. He is not mentioned as one of the characters of the story until chapter 32; and then, as the friends are silenced and Job&#x27;s words are ended, Elihu has the whole field to himself, until theophany of the whirlwind proves too portentous for him to bear. His four speeches take up chapters 32-37. Some critics have considered that the Elihu portion of the Book of Job was added by a later hand, and urge obscurities and prolixities, as well as a different style, to prove that it was the work of an inferior writer. This estimate seems, however, to take into account only the part it plays in a didactic treatise, or a theological debate. It looks quite different when we read it as a real dramatic element in a story; in other words, when we realize that the prevailing interest of the Book of Job is not dialectic but narrative.Thus viewed, the Elihu episode is a skillfully managed agency in preparing the denouncement. Consider the situation at the end of Job&#x27;s words (Job 31:40). Job has vindicated his integrity and stands ready to present his cause to God (Job 31:35-37). The friends, however, have exhausted their resources, and through three discourses have been silent, as it were, snuffed out of existence. It is at this point, then, that Elihu is introduced, to renew their contention with young constructive blood, and represent their cause (as he deems) better than they can themselves. He is essentially at one with them in condemning Job (Job 34:34-37); his only quarrel with them is on the score of the inconclusiveness of their arguments (32:3,1). His self-portrayal is conceived in a decided spirit of satire on the part of the writer, not unmingled with a sardonic humor. He is very egotistic, very sure of the value of his ideas; much of his alleged prolixity is due to that voluble self-deprecation which betrays an inordinate opinion of oneself (compare  Job 32:6-22). This, whether inferior composition or not, admirably adapts his words to his character. For substance of discourse he adds materially to what the friends have said, but in a more rationalistic vein; speaks edifyingly, as the friends have not done, of the disciplinary value of affliction, and of God&#x27;s means of revelation by dreams and visions and the interpreting of an intercessory friend (Job 33:13-28).Very evidently, however, his ego is the center of his system; it is he who sets up as Job&#x27;s mediator (Job 33:5-7; compare  Job 9:32-35), and his sage remarks on God&#x27;s power and wisdom in Nature are full of self-importance. All this seems designed to accentuate the almost ludicrous humiliation of his coll...</p>

Elijah is identified at his first appearance (1Ki 17:1) as &quot;Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the sojourners of Gilead.&quot; Thus his native place must have been called Tishbeh. A Tishbeh (Thisbe) in the territory of Naphtali is known from Tobit 1:2; but if (with most modern commentators) the reading of the Septuagint in 1Ki is followed, the word translated &quot;sojourners&quot; is itself &quot;Tishbeh,&quot; locating the place in Gilead and making the prophet a native of that mountain region and not merely a &quot;sojourner&quot; there.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I. The Works of Elijah.In 1Ki 16:29-34 we read of the impieties of Ahab, culminating in his patronage of the worship of the Tyrian Baal, god of his Tyrian queen Jezebel (1Ki 16:31). 1Ki 16:34 mentions as another instance of the little weight attached in Ahab&#x27;s time to ancient prophetic threatenings, the rebuilding by Hiel the Bethelite of the banned city of Jericho, &quot;with the loss&quot; of Hiel&#x27;s eldest and youngest sons. This is the situation which calls for a judgment of Yahweh, announced beforehand, as is often the case, by a faithful prophet of Yahweh.1. The Judgment of Drought:Whether Elijah was already a familiar figure at the court of Ahab, the narrative beginning with 1Ki 17:1 does not state. His garb and manner identified him as a prophet, in any case (2Ki 1:8; compare Zec 13:4). Elijah declared in few words that Yahweh, true and only rightful God of Israel, whose messenger he was, was even at the very time sending a drought which should continue until the prophet himself declared it at an end. The term is to be fixed, indeed, not by Elijah but by Yahweh; it is not to be short (&quot;these years&quot;), and it is to end only when the chastisement is seen to be sufficient. Guided, as true prophets were continually, by the &quot;word of Yahweh,&quot; Elijah then hid himself in one of the ravines east of (&quot;before&quot;) the Jordan, where the brook Cherith afforded him water, and ravens brought him abundant food (&quot;bread and flesh&quot; twice daily), 1Ki 17:2-6. As the drought advanced the brook dried up. Elijah was then directed, by the &quot;word of Yahweh,&quot; as constantly, to betake himself beyond the western limit of Ahab&#x27;s kingdom to the Phoenician village of Zarephath, near Sidon. There the widow to whom Yahweh sent him was found gathering a few sticks from the ground at the city gate, to prepare a last meal for herself and her son. She yielded to the prophet&#x27;s comman...</p>

Because of a severe famine in Judea, he emigrated to the land of Moab with his wife and his sons, Mahlon and Chilion. Not long afterward he died, and his two sons married Moabite women, Ru and Orpah. Ten years in all were spent in Moab, when the two sons died, and the three widows were left. Soon afterward Naomi decided to return to Judah, and the sequel is told in the Book of Ruth.See RUTH; NAOMI.J. J. Reeve</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">The first and most prominent of the three friends of Job (Job 2:11), who come from distant places to condole with and comfort him, when they hear of his affliction.That he is to be regarded as their leader and spokesman is shown by the greater weight and originality of his speeches (contained in Job 4; Job 5;  Job 15;  Job 22), the speeches of the other friends being in fact largely echoes and emotional enforcements of his thoughts, and by the fact that he is taken as their representative (Job 42:7) when, after the address from the whirlwind, Yahweh appoints their expiation for the wrong done to Job and to the truth.He is represented as a venerable and benignant sage from Teman in Idumaea, a place noted for its wisdom (compare Jer 49:7), as was also the whole land of Edom (compare Ob 1:8); and doubtless it is the writer&#x27;s design to make his words typical of the best wisdom of the world. This wisdom is the result of ages of thought and experience (compare Job 15:17-19), of long and ripened study (compare Job 5:27), and claims the authority of revelation, though only revelation of a secondary kind (compare Eliphaz&#x27; vision, Job 4:12 ff, and his challenge to Job to obtain the like,  Job 5:1).In his first speech he deduces Job&#x27;s affliction from the natural sequence of effect from cause (Job 4:7-11), which cause he makes broad enough to include innate impurity and depravity (Job 4:17-19); evinces a quietism which deprecates Job&#x27;s selfdestroying outbursts of wrath (Job 5:2,3; compare Job&#x27;s answer, Job 6:2,3; 30:24); and promises restoration as the result of penitence and submission. In his second speech he is irritated because Job&#x27;s blasphemous words are calculated to hinder devotion (Job 15:4), attributes them to iniquity (Job 15:5,6), reiterates his depravity doctrine (Job 15:14-16), and initiates the lurid descriptions of the wicked man&#x27;s fate, in which the friends go on to overstate their case (Job 15:20-35). In the third speech he is moved by the exigencies of his theory to impute actual frauds and crimes to Job, iniquities indulged in because God was too far away to see (22:5-15); but as a close holds open to him still the way of penitence, abjuring of iniquity, and restoration to health and wealth (22:21-30). His utterances are well composed and judicial (too coldly academic, Job thinks, 16:4,5), full of good religious counsel abstractly considered.Their error is in their inveterate presupposition of Job&#x27;s wickedness, their unsympathetic clinging to theory in the face of fact, and the suppressing of the human promptings of friendship.John Franklin Genung</p>

GENERAL ESTIMATE LITERATUREA prophet, the disciple and successor of Elijah. He was the son of Shaphat, lived at Abel-meholah, at the northern end of the Jordan valley and a little South of the Sea of Galilee. Nothing is told of his parents but the father&#x27;s name, though he must have been a man of some wealth and doubtless of earnest piety. No hint is given of Elisha&#x27;s age or birth-place, and it is almost certain that he was born and reared at Abel-meholah, and was a comparatively young man when we first hear of him. His early life thus was spent on his father&#x27;s estate, in a god-fearing family, conditions which have produced so many of God&#x27;s prophets. His moral and religious nature was highly developed in such surroundings, and from his work on his father&#x27;s farm he was called to his training as a prophet and successor of Elijah.====================================================================================I. His Call and Preparation.The first mention of him occurs in 1Ki 19:16. Elijah was at Horeb, learning perhaps the greatest lesson of his life; and one of the three duties with which he was charged was to anoint Elisha, the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah, as prophet in his stead.1. His Call:Elijah soon went northward and as he passed the lands of Shaphat he saw Elisha plowing in the rich level field of his father&#x27;s farm. Twelve yoke of oxen were at work, Elisha himself plowing with the twelfth yoke. Crossing over to him Elijah threw his mantle upon the young man (1Ki 19:19). Elisha seemed to understand the meaning of the symbolic act, and was for a moment overwhelmed with its significance. It meant his adoption as the son and successor of Elijah in the prophetic office. Naturally he would hesitate a moment before making such an important decision. As Elijah strode on, Elisha felt the irresistible force of the call of God and ran after the great prophet, announcing that he was ready to follow; only he wished to give a parting kiss to his father and mother (1Ki 19:20). Elijah seemed to realize what it meant to the young man, and bade him &quot;Go back again; for what have I done to thee?&quot; The call was not such an urgent one as Elisha seemed to think, and the response had better be deliberate and voluntary. But Elisha had fully made up his mind, slew the yoke of oxen with which he was plowing, boiled their flesh with the wood of the implements he was using, and made a farewell feast for his friends. He then followed Elijah, making a full renunciation of home ties, comforts and privileges. He becam...</p>

The Targum on Ezekiel gives &quot;the province of Italy.&quot; Other suggestions include Hellas, Ells, and Alsa; the last named is a kingdom mentioned in the Tell el-Amarna Letters, but its precise location is unknown.

Probably a gentilic adjective giving the home of the prophet; not definitely identified. Three traditions may be noted:(1) The Nestorians venerate the supposed tomb of the prophet in the village of Alqush not far from the east bank of the Tigris, about two days&#x27; journey almost directly north of Mosul.(2) Jerome states in the prologue to his commentary on Na that the village of Helkesei in Galilee was pointed out to him as Elkosh. This Helkesei is probably El-Kauzeh between Ramieh and Bint Jebeil.(3) The treatise De Vitis Prophetarum of the Pseudo-Epiphanius says that Nahum came from &quot;Elkesei beyond Jordan towards Begabor and was of the tribe of Simeon.&quot; Nestle has shown that the words &quot;beyond Jordan&quot; are probably a gloss, and that for Begabor should be read Betogabra, the modern Beit Jibrin in Southern Palestine. In favor of this identification may be urged the following facts:(a) that parallels to the name Elkosh, such as Eltekeh and Eltekon, are found in the southern country;(b) that the word probably contains the name of the Edomite god Qaush, whose name appears in the names of Edomite kings in the Assyrian inscriptions of the 8th and 7th centuries BC, such as Qaush-malaka and the like.(c) that the internal evidence of the prophecy makes the Judean origin of the prophet almost certain.LITERATURE.

The Name and Its Etymology:The city over which Arioch (Eri-Aku) and other Babylonian kings ruled (Ge 14:1). The Semitic-Babylonians form of its name is (al) Larsa, &quot;the city Larsa,&quot; a form which implies that the Hebrew has interchanged r and s, and transposed the final vowel. Its Sumerian name is given as Ararwa, apparently for Arauruwa, &quot;light-abode,&quot; which, in fact, is the meaning of the ideographic group with which it is written. The ruins of this ancient site are now known as Senqara, and lie on the East bank of the Euphrates, about midway between Warka (Erech) and Muqayyar (Ur of the Chaldees). In addition to the name Larsa, it seems also to have been called Aste azaga &quot;the holy (bright, pure) seat&quot; (or throne), and both its names were apparently due to its having been one of the great Babylonian centers of sun-god worship.2. Its Holy Places:Like most of the principal cities of Babylonia, it had a great temple-tower, called E-dur-an-ki, &quot;house of the bond of heaven and earth.&quot; The temple of the city bore the same name as that at Sippar, i.e. E-babbar, &quot;House of Light,&quot; where the sun-god Samas was worshipped. This temple was restored by Ur-Engur, Hammurabi (Amraphel), Burna-burias, Nebuchadrezzar and Nabonidus. Among the tablets found on this site by Loftus was that which gives measures of length and square and cube roots, pointing to the place as one of the great centers of Babylonian learning. Besides the remains of these temples, there are traces of the walls, and the remains of houses of the citizens. The city was at first governed by its own kings, but became a part of the Babylonian empire some time after the reign of Hammurabi.LITERATURE.Loftus, Chaldea and Susiana; Delitzsch, Wo lag das Paradies?; Zehnpfund, Babylonien in seinen wichtigsten Ruinenstatten, 53- 54.T.

A statement uttered by Jesus on the cross just before his death, translated, &quot;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&quot; (Mt 27:46; Mr 15:34).There is an interesting but difficult problem in connection with the interpretation of this passage. There seems to be a mixture of Aramaic and Hebrew.The first two words, whether in Hebrew or Aramaic, have sufficient similarity to each other and each sufficient similarity to the name itself to warrant the jeer that Jesus was calling upon Elias, or the sincere supposition of those who might not fully understand the language, that he was actually calling on Elias.The forms lema and lama used in Matthew and Mark respectively (Westcott and Hort, The New Testament in Greek) represent the various possible forms, the first the Aramaic, and the second the Hebrew. The various readings and translations of the latter word, sabachthani, only add confusion to an effort at ultimate explanation of the real statement. Certainly the influence of the Aramaic played a geat part in the translation and transmission of the original. The spirit revealed by Jesus in this utterance seems to be very much like that displayed in the Garden when He cried out to have the cup removed from Him.Walter G. Clippinger</p>

The method of manufacture is unknown. The designs may have been woven into cloth or drawn in by a needle or hook (Jud 5:30; Ps 45:14; Eze 16:10,13,18; 26:16; 27:7,16,24).Ma`aseh raqam is translated &quot;the work of the embroiderer&quot; in the Revised Version (British and American) instead of &quot;needlework&quot; (Ex 26:36; 27:16; 28:39; 36:37; 38:18; 39:29; Jud 5:30; Ps 45:14).Raqam, &quot;embroiderer,&quot; occurs in Ex 35:35; 38:23. The fact that this word is used instead of `aragh, &quot;weaver,&quot; would lead us to suppose that the embroiderers&#x27; work was either different from that of the weaver or that a &quot;raqam&quot; was especially skilled in fine weaving. Another word, choshebh, is used to describe a skillful weaver. &quot;Cunning work&quot; in the King James Version of Ex 26:1,31; 28:6,15; 35:33,15; 36:8,35; 39:3,1 is rendered in the American Standard Revised Version &quot;work of the skillful workmen.&quot; The passage has been freely rendered &quot;designers.&quot;In the Revised Version (British and American) of Ex 28:39 shabhats is translated &quot;weave.&quot;In Ex 28:4 occurs the word tashbets, which is translated &quot;broidered&quot; in the King James Version and &quot;checker work&quot; in the Revised Version (British and American). If this kind of work is what it is supposed to be, it is more truly &quot;needlework&quot; than the embroidery. This work is still done in some of the Syrian cities and towns, especially in Damascus. Small caps for men to wear under their ordinary headdress and loose outer garments or dressing-gowns are the forms in which it is commonly seen. The checker-work effect is obtained by sewing in a cotton string between two pieces of cloth, so as to form designs. The patterns Usually run to straight lines such as zigzags or squares. The effect is striking, and we can well imagine would have made an impressive priest&#x27;s robe, especially if costly materials were used.See also CRAFTS.James A. Patch</p>

In the Hebrew text of this passage the Qere substitutes for it the word techorim, a term which occurs in the next chapter in the description of the golden models of these swellings that were made as votive offerings (1Sa 6:11-17). The swellings were symptoms of a plague, and the history is precisely that of the outbreak of an epidemic of bubonic plague. The older writers supposed by comparison of the account in 1Sa with Ps 78:66 that they were hemorrhoids (or piles), and the older English term in the King James Version is a 16th-century form of that Greek word, which occurs in several medical treatises of the 16th and 17th centuries. There is, however, no evidence that this identification is correct. In the light of the modern research which has proved that the rat-flea (Pulex cheopis) is the most active agent in conveying the virus of plague to the human subject, it is worthy of note that the plague of tumors was accompanied by an invasion of mice (`akhbor) or rats. The rat is not specifically mentioned in the Bible, although it was as common in Canaan and Israelite times as it is today, a fact demonstrated by the frequency with which their bones occur in all strata of the old Palestinian cities, so it is probable that the term used was a generic one for both rodents.The coincidence of destructive epidemics and invasions of mice is also recorded by Herodotus (ii.141), who preserves a legend that the army of Sennacherib which entered Egypt was destroyed by the agency of mice. He states that a statue of Ptah, commemorating the event, was extant in his day. The god held a mouse in his hand, and bore the inscription: &quot;Whosoever sees me, let him reverence the gods.&quot; This may have been a reminiscence of the story in Isa 37:36.For other references see PLAGUE.Alex.

As the name was given to them by the Moabites, it may not have been that by which they called themselves. A tall race, known to the Israelites as REPHAIM (which see), once existed in Southern Palestine as well as on the East side of the Jordan, but its exact relationship is unknown.

Possibly the same Greek name may not always have been derived from the same Hebrew, and as Cheyne suggests (2) may have come from ha-motsah (see below).1. Emmaus of the Apocrypha:A place where Judas Maccabeus defeated Gorgias ( /APC 1Macc 4); it was &quot;in the plain&quot; ( /APC 1Macc 3:40); it was subsequently fortified by Bacchides ( /APC 1Macc 9:50). It is frequently mentioned by Josephus (Ant., XIV, xi, 2; BJ, I, xi, 2; II, v, 1; xx, 4; IV, viii, 1; V, i, 6), and also in the Talmud and Midrash. It is now the modern mud-village of `Amwas, 20 miles along, and a little North of, the main road from Jerusalem to Jaffa. In the 3rd century it was called Nicopolis and was an episcopal see; in early Christian times it was famous for a spring of reputed healing qualities.2. Emmaus of Luke:The Emmaus of Lu 24:13, a village 60 furlongs (stadia) from Jerusalem. Early Christian tradition appears to have identified it with (1) and hence, to harmonize the distance, some manuscripts have 160 furlongs. Eusebius and Jerome place this Emmaus at `Amwas; but in the first place(1) was a city and not a village (kome), and secondly(2) the distance, 40 miles there and back, is an almost impossible one for the narrative.In Crusading times this difficulty appears to have been realized, and on what grounds is not known, Kubeibeh at just over 60 stadia, Northwest of Jerusalem, was selected as the site of Emmaus. There a fine church was built which has in recent years been rebuilt and today a Franciscan hospice and school, attached to the church, and a newer German Roman Catholic hospice, combine with the considerable picturesqueness of the place itself to fortify the tradition.A much more probable site is Quloniyeh, a village about 35 stadia from Jerusalem, on the road to Jaffa. Josephus narrates (BJ, VII, vi, 6) that Vespasian &quot;assigned a place for 800 men only whom he had dismissed from his army which he gave them for their habitation; it is called Emmaus and is distant from Jerusalem 60 furlongs.&quot; This is almost certainly the Emmaus of Luke; it is highly probable that the name quloniyeh is derived from the fact of its being this Colonia. Close to this place is a ruin known as Bet Mizza, which is probably the Mozah (ha-motsah) of Jos 18:26 which in the Talmud (Cukk. 45) is also described as a colonia. Today it is a &quot;colony&quot; of Jews who have revived and always use the old name Motsah for their settlement.Other suggestions for this Emmaus are(a) el Khamsa, considerably over 60 stadia Southwest of Jerusalem (Conder);(b) Koriet el `enab, some 10 stadia farther a1ong the Jerus-Jaffa road than Kuloniyeh (LB, etc.); and(c) `Artas, S. of Bethlehem, where remains of Roman baths have been ...</p>

The Greek word is used in this sense in Ac 13:45; Ro 13:13; 1Co 3:3; Jas 3:14,16; 2Co 12:20; Ga 5:20; the Revised Version (British and American) translated by &quot;jealousy.&quot; It denotes a work of the flesh or lower nature, which Christians often fail sufficiently to guard against; it pleases &quot;the flesh&quot; to excite such a feeling in others.(2) In Ro 11:14 the King James Version &quot;emulation&quot; is the translation of parazeloo (&quot;to make one zealous or jealous&quot;), and is there used in a good sense. &quot;If by any means I may provoke to emulation (the Revised Version (British and American) jealousy) them that are my flesh&quot; (compare Ro 10:19, quoted from De 32:21). It is well to &quot;provoke to emulation&quot; in this sense, those who are slow or indifferent, by the example of earnestness and zeal on our part.

Here dwelt the woman who had a familiar spirit, whom Saul consulted on the night before the battle of Gilboa (1Sa 28:7). Here also, according to Ps 83:10, perished fugitives of Sisera&#x27;s army, after their defeat at the Kishon. The place was therefore not far from the Kishon and Tabor.It is generally identified with the modern Endur, a small village on the northern slope of Jebel ed-Duchy, with several ancient caves. It is not far from Nain and Shunem, and looks across the valley along which the broken ranks of Sisera may have attempted to make their way eastward to the open uplands, and thence to their native North. Coming hither from Gilboa, eluding the Philistine outposts under cover of the darkness, Saul would cross the Vale of Jezreel, and pass round the eastern base of the mountain, the Philistines being on the west.W.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">wich:In 1Sa 28:3-25, it is narrated how Saul, in despair of mind because Yahweh had forsaken him, on the eve of the fatal battle of Gilboa, resorted in disguise to &quot;a woman that had a familiar spirit&quot; (&#x27;obh: see DIVINATION; NECROMANCY), at En-dor, and besought the woman to divine for him, and bring him up from the dead whom he should name. On the woman reminding him how Saul had cut off from the land those who practiced these arts--a proof of the existence and operation of the laws against divination, witchcraft, necromancy, etc. (Le 19:31; De 18:9-14)--the king assured her of immunity, and bade her call up Samuel. The incidents that followed have been the subject of much discussion and of varied interpretation. It seems assumed in the narrative that the woman did see an appearance, which the king, on her describing it, recognized to bethat of Samuel.This, however, need be only the narrator&#x27;s interpretation of the events. It is not to be credited that the saintly Samuel was actually summoned from his rest by the spells of a professional diviner. Some have thought that Samuel, by God&#x27;s permission, did indeed appear, as much to the woman&#x27;s dismay as to the king&#x27;s; and urge in favor of this the woman&#x27;s evident surprise and terror at his appearance (1Sa 28:12 ff), and the true prophecy of Saul&#x27;s fate (1Sa 28:16-19).It may conceivably have been so, but the more reasonable view is that the whole transaction was a piece of feigning on the part of the woman. The Septuagint uses the word eggastrimuthos (&quot;a ventriloquist&quot;) to describe the woman and those who exercised kindred arts (1Sa 28:9). Though pretending ignorance (1Sa 28:12), the woman doubtless recognizes Saul from the first. It was she who saw Samuel, and reported his words; the king himself saw and heard nothing. It required no great skill in a practiced diviner to forecast the general issue of the battle about to take place, and the disaster that would overtake Saul and his sons; while if the forecast had proved untrue, the narrative of the witch of En-dor would never have been written. Saul, in fact, was not slain, but killed himself. The incident, therefore, may best be ranked in the same category as the feats of modern mediumship.James Orr</p>

In 1Ch 6:73 it is replaced by Anem. It probably corresponds to the Ginnea of Josephus (Ant., XX, vi, 1; BJ, III, iii, 4), and may certainly be identified with the modern Jenin, a prosperous village on the southern edge of the plain of Esdraelon, with beautiful gardens, fruitful orchards and plentiful supplies of water from the local springs.W.

According to 2Ch 20:2 it is the same as Hazazon-tamar, mentioned in Ge 14:7 as occupied by the Amorites and as having been attacked by Chedorlaomer after leaving Kadesh and El Paran on his way to the Vale of Siddim. The place is situated upon the West shore of the Dead Sea about midway between the North and the South ends, and was included in the territory of Judah (Jos 15:62). The spot is rendered attractive by the verdure clothing it by reason of immense fountains of warm water, 80 degrees F., which pour out from beneath the limestone cliffs.In the time of Solomon (So 1:14) palms and vines were cultivated here. Josephus also mentions its beautiful palm groves.In the time of Eusebius it was still a place of importance, but since the Middle Ages it has been almost deserted, being occupied now only by a few Arabs. The oasis occupies a small area a few hundred feet above the Dead Sea marked by the 650 ft. sedimentary terrace heretofore described (see DEAD SEA). The limestone borders rise so abruptly to a height of 2,000 ft. immediately on the West, that the place can be approached only by a rock-cut path. Two streams, Wady Sugeir and Wady el- Areyeh, descend on either side through precipitous rocky gorges from the uninhabitable wilderness separating it from Bethlehem and Hebron. It was in the caves opening out from the sides of these gorges that David took refuge from Saul (1Sa 24:1). During the reign of Jehoshaphat (2Ch 20:2), the children of Ammon, Moab and Mt. Seir attempted to invade Judah by way of En-gedi, but were easily defeated as they came up from the gorges to occupy the advantageous field of battle chosen by Jehoshaphat.George Frederick Wright</p>

G. A. Smith thinks &quot;spring of the current,&quot; or &quot;stream,&quot; from Syriac rogulo, more probable.(1) En-rogel was an important landmark on the boundary between Judah and Benjamin (Jos 15:7; 18:16). Here David&#x27;s spies, Jonathan and Ahimaaz, hid themselves (2Sa 17:17), and here (1Ki 1:9) &quot;Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel,&quot; when he anticipated his father&#x27;s death and caused himself rebelliously to be proclaimed king.(2) The identification of this important landmark is of first-class importance in Jerusalem topography. Two sites have been proposed:(a) The older view identifies En-rogel with the spring known variously as &quot;the Virgin&#x27;s Fount,&quot; `Ain sitti Miriam and `Ain Umm el deraj, an intermittent source of water which rises in a cave on the West side of the Kedron valley opposite Siloam (see GIHON). The arguments that this is the one Jerusalem spring and that this must have been a very important landmark are inconclusive. The strongest argument for this view is that put forward by M. Clermont-Ganneau, who found that a rough rock surface on the mountain slope opposite, an ascent to the village of Silwan, is known as es Zechweleh, a word in which there certainly appears to linger an echo of Zoheleth. The argument is, however, not as convincing as it seems. Firstly, Zoheleth was a stone; this is a natural rock scarp; such a stone might probably have been transferred from place to place. Secondly, it is quite common for a name to be transferred some miles; instances are numerous. Thirdly, the writer, after frequent inquiries of the fellahin of Silwan, is satisfied that the name is by no means confined to the rock scarp near the spring, but to the whole ridge running along from here to, or almost to, Bir Eyyub itself. The strongest argument against this identification is, however, that there are so much stronger reasons for identifying the &quot;Virgin&#x27;s Fount&quot; with Gihon (see GIHON), and that the two springs En-rogel and Gihon cannot be at one site, as is clear from the narrative in 1Ki 1.(b) The view which places En-rogel at Bir Eyyub in every way harmonizes with the Bible data. It has been objected that the latter is not a spring but a well. It is today a well, 125 ft. deep, but one with an inexhaustible supply--there must be a true spring at the bottom. Probably one reason it only overflows today after periods of heavy rain is that such enormous quantities of debris have now covered the original valley bed that the water cannot rise to the surface; much of it flows away down the valley deep under the present surface. The water is brackish and is impregnated with sewage, which is no...</p>

They included enchantment, sorcery, witchcraft, sooth-saying, augury, necromancy, divination in numberless forms, and all kinds of magic article Nine varieties are mentioned in one single passage in the Pentateuch (De 18:10,11); other varieties in many passages both in the Old Testament and New Testament, eg. Le 19:26,31; Isa 2:6; 57:3; Jer 27:9; Mic 5:12; Ac 8:9,11; 13:6,8; Ga 5:20; Re 9:21.The extent of the magic arts (forbidden under Judaism and Christianity) may incidentally be seen from the fact that the Scriptures alone refer to their being practiced in Chaldea (Da 5:11), Babylon (Eze 21:21), Assyria (2Ki 17:17), Egypt (Ex 7:11), Canaan (Le 18:3,11; 19:26,31), Asia (Ephesus, Ac 19:13,19), Greece (Ac 16:16), Arabia also, as &quot;customs from the East,&quot; etc. (Isa 2:6) indicates. These secret arts were prohibited by the laws of Moses (De 18:9-12), inasmuch as they constituted a peculiar temptation to Israel to apostatize. They were a constant incentive to idolatry, clouded the mind with superstition, tended and were closely allied to imposture (Mt 24:24). The term &quot;enchantment&quot; is found only in the Old Testament and its Hebrew originals indicate its varieties.(1) laTim, and lehaTim &quot;to wrap up,&quot; &quot;muffie,&quot; &quot;cover,&quot; hence, &quot;clandestine,&quot; &quot;secret.&quot; It was this hidden element that enabled the magicians of Egypt to impose on the credulity of Pharaoh in imitating or reproducing the miracles of Moses and Aaron; &quot;They .... did in like manner with their enchantments&quot; (Ex 7:11,22). Their inability to perform a genuine miracle is shown by Ex 8:18.(2) nachash, &quot;to hiss,&quot; &quot;whisper&quot; referring to the mutterings of sorcerers in their incantations. Used as a derivative noun this Hebrew word means &quot;a serpent.&quot; This involves the idea of cunning and subtlety. Although employed in the wider sense of augury or prognostication, its fundamental meaning is divination by serpents. This was the form of enchantment sought by Balaam (Nu 24:1). Its impotence against the people of God is shown by Nu 23:23 m. Shalmaneser forced this forbidden art upon the Israelites whom he carried captive to Assyria (2Ki 17:17). It was also one of the heathen practices introduced during the apostasy under Ahab, against which Elijah protested (compare 1Ki 21:20).(3) lachash, &quot;to whisper,&quot; &quot;mutter,&quot; an onomatopoetic word, like the above, in imitation of the hiss of serpents. It is used of the offensive practice of serpent charming referred to in Ec 10:11, and as Delitzsch says, in the place cited., &quot;signifies the whispering of formulas of charming.&quot; See also Isa 3:3, &quot;skilful enchanter&quot;; Jer 8:17, &quot;serpents, cockatrices (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;adders&quot;) .... which will not be charmed&quot;; Ps 58:4,5, &quot;the voice of charmers (the Revised Version, margin &quot;enchanters&quot;), charming never so wisely.&quot; Ophiomancy, the art of charming serpents, is still practiced in the East.(4...</p>

The priesthood was based upon His possession, by nature, of a life which in time and eternity death could not touch. This distinguished Him essentially from priests under the law.(2) In 1Ti 1:4, Paul warns Timothy against giving heed in his ministry to &quot;fables (muthoi) and endless (limitless) genealogies.&quot; The allusion seems to be to the series of emanations (aeons) in Gnostic speculation, to which no limit could be set.Distinct from the above are the words denoting &quot;everlasting,&quot; &quot;eternal,&quot; which see.James Orr</p>

Among the captives was Tobit, taken from Thisbe in Gilead, where the prophet Elijah was born and for a time lived. The writer of Tobit makes Sennacherib the son (1 15), as well as the successor of Enemessar, whereas, according to the Assyrian inscriptions, Sennacherib was the son of Sargon. This is only one of several serious historical difficulties in the narrative of Tobit. The corruption of the name is variously explained. Rawlinson supposes the first syllable of the word &quot;Shal&quot; to have been dropped, comparing the Bupalussor of Abydenus for Nabopolassar. Dr. Pinches takes Enemessar for Senemessar, the &quot;sh&quot; being changed to &quot;s&quot; and then to the smooth breathing, though the rough breathing more commonly takes the place of a dropped &quot;s&quot;; both scholars admit the easy transposition of the liquids &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;.

The Hebrew word most often so translated is &#x27;oyebh, meaning perhaps literally, &quot;one who hates&quot;; very frequent in the Psalms, eg. 3:7; 6:10; 7:5; 8:2; 9:3,1; 13:2, where the cry is often for deliverance from enemies. Another word for &quot;enemy,&quot; found chiefly in the poetical books, is tsar, or tsar, &quot;distresser,&quot; &quot;straitener&quot; (Nu 10:9; Job 16:9; Ps 27:2,12, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;adversary,&quot; etc.); also tsarar (Es 3:10; Ps 8:2; 10:5 the King James Version, etc.). Other words are `ar, &quot;one awake&quot; (1Sa 28:16 the King James Version; Da 4:19 the King James Version); sane&#x27;, perhaps, &quot;to be sharp or bite&quot; (Ex 1:10; Pr 25:21; 27:6); sharar, &quot;to watch&quot; (Ps 5:8; 27:11), and qum, &quot;to stand up,&quot; or &quot;withstand&quot; (Ex 32:25).In the New Testament echthros, &quot;enemy,&quot; &quot;opponent,&quot; is the only word translated &quot;enemy&quot; (Mt 5:43,14; Mr 12:36; Lu 1:71,74, etc.; Ro 5:10; 11:28, etc.), once with anthropos (&quot;a man&quot;), joined to echthros (Mt 13:28).In the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;adversary&quot; is frequently substituted for &quot;enemy&quot; (Nu 24:8; De 32:41; Ps 6:7; 7:6; 44:10, etc.); for &quot;O thou enemy,&quot; etc. (Ps 9:6) we have &quot;The enemy are come to an end&quot;; instead of &quot;When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him&quot; (Isa 59:19) we have &quot;For he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Yahweh driveth&quot; (with the text of the King James Version in margins); for &quot;The fire of thine enemies shall devour them&quot; (Isa 26:11), &quot;Fire shall devour thine adversaries&quot; (text of the King James Version in the margin).The frequent reference to enemies in the Old Testament is what we should expect to see in these early times on the part of a people settling in a land that had been occupied by other tribes, worshipping other gods. The spirit of their law was that expressed by our Lord in His Sermon on the Mount, &quot;Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy.&quot; This He changed: &quot;but I say unto you, Love your enemies.&quot; An approach toward this spirit had been made in the later prophets by their inclusion of the whole world under one God, who had a gracious purpose toward all, but the near statement of it we only find in Pr 25:21 (quoted by Paul, Ro 12:20).

LITERATURE=====================================================================================English Versions of the Scriptures.1. Introductory:The battle for vernacular Scripture, the right of a nation to have the sacred writings in its own tongue, was fought and won in England. Ancient VSS, such as the Syriac and the Gothic, were produced to meet obvious requirements of the teacher or the missionary, and met with no opposition from any quarter. The same was the case with the efforts of the Anglo-Saxon church to provide portions of Scripture for the use of the people. Even in later times the Latin church seems to have followed no consistent policy in permitting or forbidding the translation of the Scriptures. In one country the practice was forbidden, in another it was regarded with forbearance or permitted under authority (Addis and Arnold, Catholic Dictionary, London, 1884, article &quot;Bible&quot;); and so it came about that the different nations of Europe came by the inestimable boon of an open Bible in different ways. Germany, for example, after the attempts of numerous translators who seem to have been quite untrammeled in their work owed, under Providence, to the faith, the intrepidity and the genius of Luther the national version which satisfied it for more than three centuries, and, after a recent and essentially conservative revision, satisfies it still. In England, as related below, things took a different course. In the Reformation period the struggle turned mainly on the question of the translation of the Bible.2. The Bible in Anglo-Saxon and Norman Times:The clergy and learned men had always of course access to the Scriptures in the Vulgate, a translation of the original Scriptures into Latin completed by Jerome at the very beginning of the 5th century; and from this version--the Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 AD.)--practically all further translations were made till the days of Luther. Within a century or little more after the landing of Augustine in England and his settlement at Canterbury (597 AD) Caedmon, a monk of Whitby, produced (670) his metrical version of the Bible, hardly indeed to be reckoned a version of the Scriptures in the ordinary sense, though it paved the way for such. Bede of Jarrow (672-735) translated the Creed and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and, according to the beauti...</p>

This spiritual enlightening the Spirit of God brings about through the Divine word (Ps 119:130; 2Ti 3:15; 2Pe 1:19).

He is said (Ge 5:23) to have lived 365 years, but the brief record of his life is comprised in the words, &quot;Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him&quot; (Ge 5:24). The expression &quot;walked with God&quot; denotes a devout life, lived in close communion with God, while the reference to his end has always been understood, as by the writer of He, to mean, &quot;By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him&quot; (Heb 11:5).See further, APOCALYPTIC LITERATURE, sec.

It is impossible to fix more definitely the locality of this first of cities, recorded, as Delitzsch says (Genesis, in the place cited.), as registering an advance in civilization. The &quot;city&quot; would be a very simple affair, a place of protection for himself, wife and household, perhaps connected with the fear spoken of in Ge 4:14.</p>

At Moses&#x27; command the children of Israel, before crossing the Red Sea, took the wrong way in order to give Pharaoh the impression that they were lost in the wilderness and cause him to say &quot;They are entangled in the land&quot; (Ex 14:3).(2) Mental:pagideuo, &quot;to entrap,&quot; &quot;ensnare,&quot; with words, as birds are caught in a snare; compare Ec 9:12. The Pharisees sought to &quot;entangle&quot; (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;ensnare&quot;) Jesus in His talk (Mt 22:15).(3) Moral:`empleko, &quot;to inweave,&quot; hence, intertwine and involve. &quot;A god soldier of Jesus Christ,&quot; says Paul, does not &quot;entangle himself,&quot; i.e. become involved, &quot;in the affairs of this life&quot; (2Ti 2:4). Having &quot;escaped the defilements of the world,&quot; Christians are not to be &quot;again entangled therein&quot; (2Pe 2:20).(4) Spiritual:enecho, &quot;to hold in,&quot; hence, to hold captive, as a slave in fetters or under a burden. Having experienced spiritual emancipation, freedom, through Christ from bondage to sin and false religion (Ga 5:1; compare Ga 4:8), the Gentiles were not to become &quot;entangled again in a yoke of bondage&quot; by submission to mere legal requirements, as the external rite of circumcision.With reference to the thoroughness and irresistibleness of God&#x27;s judgments, we read in Na 1:10, &quot;For entangled like thorns&quot; (the King James Version &quot;while they be folden together as thorns&quot;), damp, closely packed and intertwined, &quot;they are consumed utterly as dry stubble&quot; (the King James Version &quot;devoured as stubble fully dry&quot;).Dwight M.

It is to be distinguished from jealousy. &quot;We are jealous of our own; we are envious of another man&#x27;s possessions. Jealousy fears to lose what it has; envy is pained at seeing another have&quot; (Crabb&#x27;s English Synonyms). In the Old Testament it is the translation of qin&#x27;ah from kana&#x27;, &quot;to redden,&quot; &quot;to glow&quot; (Job 5:2, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;jealousy,&quot; margin &quot;indignation&quot;; in Isa 26:11 the Revised Version (British and American) renders &quot;see thy zeal for the people&quot;; Pr 27:4, etc.); the verb occurs in Ge 26:14, etc.; Nu 11:29 the King James Version; Ps 106:16; Pr 3:31, etc.; in the New Testament it is the translation of phthonos, &quot;envy&quot; (Mt 27:18; Ro 1:29; Ga 5:21, &quot;envyings,&quot; etc.); of zelos, &quot;zeal&quot;, &quot;jealousy,&quot; &quot;envy&quot; (Ac 13:45), translated &quot;envying,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;jealousy&quot; (Ro 13:13; 1Co 3:3; 2Co 12:20; Jas 3:14,16); the verb phthoneo occurs in Ga 5:26; zeloo in Ac 7:9; 17:5, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;moved with jealousy&quot;; 1Co 13:4, &quot;charity (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;love&quot;) envieth not.&quot;The power of envy is stated in Pr 27:4: &quot;Who is able to stand before envy?&quot; (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;jealousy&quot;); its evil effects are depicted in Job 5:2 (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;jealousy&quot;), in Pr 14:30 (the Revised Version, margin &quot;jealousy&quot;); it led to the crucifixion of Christ (Mt 27:18; Mr 15:10); it is one of &quot;the works of the flesh&quot; (Ga 5:21; compare Ro 1:29; 1Ti 6:4); Christian believers are earnestly warned against it (Ro 13:13 the King James Version; 1Co 3:3 the King James Version; Ga 5:26; 1Pe 2:1). In Jas 4:5 &quot;envy&quot; is used in a good sense, akin to the jealousy ascribed to God. Where the King James Version has &quot;The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) reads &quot;Doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying?&quot;; the American Revised Version, margin &quot;The spirit which he made to dwell in us he yearneth for even unto jealous envy&quot;; compare Jer 3:14; Ho 2:19 f; or the English Revised Version, margin &quot;That spirit which he made to dwell in us yearneth (for us) even unto jealous envy.&quot; This last seems to give the sense; compare &quot;Ye adulteresses&quot; (Ho 2:4), the American Revised Version, margin &quot;That is, who break your marriage vow to God.&quot;W.

Paul describes him as(1) &quot;my beloved,&quot;(2) &quot;who is the firstfruits of Asia unto Christ.&quot;Textus Receptus of the New Testament has &quot;firstfruits of Achaia&quot; but this wrong reading is due to 1Co 16:15. He was one of the first Christians in the Roman province of Asia.This salutation brings up the question of the destination of Ro 16:3-16, for it is argued that they are addressed to the church in Ephesus owing to the fact that Prisca and Aquila and Epenetus are known to have dwelt in Asia. On the other hand, there are more than 20 others in this list who are not known to have spent any time in Asia. Prisca and Aquila had once dwelt in Rome (Ac 18:2), and there is nothing unusual in an Ephesian dwelling in the capital of the empire.

He must not, however, be confounded with the messenger of the Philippian community. He was with Paul during a part of his 1st Roman imprisonment, joining in Paul&#x27;s greetings to Philemon (Phm 1:23). Epaphras was the missionary by whose instrumentality the Colossians had been converted to Christianity (Col 1:7), and probably the other churches of the Lycus had been founded by him. In sending his salutation to the Colossians Paul testified, &quot;He hath much labor for you, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis&quot; (Col 4:13). Epaphras had brought to Paul good news of the progress of the gospel, of their &quot;faith in Christ Jesus&quot; and of their love toward all the saints (Col 1:4). Paul&#x27;s regard for him is shown by his designating him &quot;our beloved fellow-servant,&quot; &quot;a faithful minister of Christ&quot; (Col 1:7), and &quot;a bondservant of Christ Jesus&quot; (Col 4:12 margin) . The last designation Paul uses several times of himself, but only once of another besides Epaphras (Php 1:1).S. F. Hunter</p>

The name corresponds to the Latin Venustus (= handsome), and was very common in the Roman period. &quot;The name occurs very frequently in inscriptions both Greek and Latin, whether at full length Epaphroditus, or in its contracted form Epaphras&quot; (Lightfoot, Philippians, 123). Epaphroditus was the delegate of the Christian community at Philippi, sent with their gift to Paul during his first Roman imprisonment. Paul calls him &quot;my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier.&quot; &quot;The three words are arranged in an ascending scale: common sympathy, common work, common danger and toil and suffering&quot; (Lightfoot, l. c.). On his arrival at Rome, Epaphroditus devoted himself to &quot;the work of Christ,&quot; both as Paul&#x27;s attendant and as his assistant in missionary work. So assiduously did he labor that he lost his health, and &quot;was sick nigh unto death.&quot; He recovered, however, and Paul sent him back to Philippi with this letter to quiet the alarm of his friends, who had heard of his serious illness. Paul besought for him that the church should receive him with joy and hold him in honor.S. F. Hunter</p>

TEACHINGVIII. LITERATURE========================================================================I. Authenticity.1. External Evidence:None of the epistles which are ascribed to Paul have a stronger chain of evidence to their early and continued use than that which we know as the Epistle to the Ephesians. Leaving for the moment the question of the relation of Eph to other New Testament writings, we find that it not only colors the phraseology of the Apostolic Fathers, but is actually quoted. In Clement of Rome (circa 95 AD) the connection with Ephesians might be due to some common liturgical form in xlvi.6 (compare Eph 4:6); though the resemblance is so close that we must feel that our epistle was known to Clement both here and in lxiv (compare Eph 1:3-4); xxxviii (compare Eph 5:21); xxxvi (compare Eph 4:18); lix (compare Eph 1:18; 4:18). Ignatius (died 115) shows numerous points of contact with Ephesians, especially in his Epistle to the Ephesians. In chap. xii we read: &quot;Ye are associates and fellow students of the mysteries with Paul, who in every letter makes mention of you in Christ Jesus.&quot; It is difficult to decide the exact meaning of the phrase &quot;every letter,&quot; but in spite of the opinion of many scholars that it must be rendered &quot;in all his epistle,&quot; i.e. in every part of his epistle, it is safer to take it as an exaggeration, &quot;in all his epistles,&quot; justified to some extent in the fact that besides Ephesians, Paul does mention the Ephesian Christians in Ro (16:5); 1Co (15:32; 16:8,19); 2Co (1:8 f); 1Ti (1:3) and 2Ti (1:18). In the opening address the connection with Eph 1:3-6 is too close to be accidental. There are echoes of our epistle in chap. i (Eph 6:1); ix (Eph 2:20-22); xviii (oikonomia, Eph 1:10); xx (Eph 2:18; 4:24); and in Ignat. ad Polyc. v we have close identity with Eph 5:25 and less certain connection with Eph 4:2, and in vi with Eph 6:13-17.The Epistle of Polycarp in two passages shows verbal agreement with Eph: in chap. i with Eph 1:8, and in xii with Eph 4:26, where we have (the Greek is missing here) ut his scripturis dictum est. Hermas speaks of the grief of the Holy Spirit in such a way as to suggest Ephesians (Mand. X, ii; compare Eph 4:30). Sim. IX, xiii, shows a knowledge of Eph 4:3-6, and possibly of 5:26 and 1:13. In the Didache (4) we find a parallel to Eph 6:5: &quot;Servants submit yourselves to your masters.&quot; In Barnabas there are two or three turns of phrase that are possibly due to Ephesians. There is a slightly stronger connection between II Clement and Ephesians, especially in chap. xiv, where we have the Ephesian figure of the church as the body of Christ, and the relation between them referred to in terms of hus...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ef&#x27;-e-sus (Ephesos, &quot;desirable&quot;):A city of the Roman province of Asia, near the mouth of the Cayster river, 3 miles from the western coast of Asia Minor, and opposite the island of Samos. With an artificial harbor accessible to the largest ships, and rivaling the harbor at Miletus, standing at the entrance of the valley which reaches far into the interior of Asia Minor, and connected by highways with the chief cities of the province, Ephesus was the most easily accessible city in Asia, both by land and sea. Its location, therefore, favored its religious, political and commercial development, and presented a most advantageous field for the missionary labors of Paul. The city stood upon the sloping sides and at the base of two hills, Prion and Coressus, commanding a beautiful view; its climate was exceptionally fine, and the soil of the valley was unusually fertile.Tradition says that in early times near the place where the mother goddess of the earth was born, the Amazons built a city and a temple in which they might worship. This little city of the Amazons, bearing at different times the names of Samorna, Trachea, Ortygia and Ptelea, flourished until in the early Greek days it aroused the cupidity of Androclus, a prince of Athens. He captured it and made it a Greek city. Still another tradition says that Androclus was its founder. However, under Greek rule the Greek civilization gradually supplanted that of the Orientals, the Greek language was spoken in place of the Asiatic; and the Asiatic goddess of the temple assumed more or less the character of the Greek Artemis. Ephesus, therefore, and all that pertained to it, was a mixture of oriental and Greek Though the early history of the city is obscure, it seems that at different times it was in the hands of the Carians, the Leleges and Ionians; in the early historical period it was one of a league of twelve Ionfan cities. In 560 BC it came into the possession of the Lydians; 3 years later, in 557, it was taken by the Persians; and during the following years the Greeks and Persians were constantly disputing for its possession. Finally, Alexander the Great took it; and at his death it fell to Lysimachus, who gave it the name of Arsinoe, from his second wife. Upon the death of Attalus II (Philadelphus), king of Pergamos, it was bequeathed to the Roman Empire; and in 190, when the Roman province of Asia was formed, it became a part of it. Ephesus and Pergamos, the capital of Asia, were the two great rival cities of the province. Though Pergamos was the center of the Roman religion and of the government, Ephesus was the more accessible, the commercial center and the home of the native goddess Diana; and because of its wealth and situation it gradually became the chief city of the province. It is to the temple of Diana, however, that its great wealth and prominence are largely due. Like the city, it dates from the time of the Amazons, yet what the early temple was like we now have no means of knowing, a...</p>

On the shoulderpieces were two onyx stones on which were engraved the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. It is not known whether the ephod extended below the hips or only to the waist. Attached to the ephod by chains of pure gold was a breastplate containing twelve precious stones in four rows. Underneath the ephod was the blue robe of the ephod extending to the feet of the priest. The robe of the ephod was thus a garment comprising, in addition to the long robe proper, the ephod with its shoulderpieces and the breastplate of judgment.(2) From the historical books we learn that ephods were worn by persons other than the high priest. Thus, the boy Samuel was girded with a linen ephod while assisting the aged high priest (1Sa 2:18); the priests at Nob, 85 in number, are described as men wearing a linen ephod (1Sa 22:18); and David was girded with a linen ephod when he danced in the procession that brought the ark into Jerusalem (2Sa 6:14). The ephod was considered appropriate for the king on this solemn and happy occasion; but it would be reading into the narrative more than it contains to infer that lay worshippers were regularly clothed with the ephod; nor are we to suppose that priests other than the high priest were accustomed to wear ephods as rich and elaborate as that of the high priest. Abiathar, who became high priest after the assassination of his father by Doeg, probably brought to the camp of David the ephod worn by the high priest in his ministrations at Nob (1Sa 23:6), and through this ephod David sought in certain crises to learn Yahweh&#x27;s will (1Sa 23:9; 30:7). Some have argued that the ephod, which Abiathar brought in his hand, was an image rather than a priestly garment, but there seems no sufficient reason for regarding it as other than a vestment for the high priest. The ephod behind which the sword of Goliath was kept wrapped in a cloth may well have been a garment suspended from the wall or itself wrapped in a protecting cloth (1Sa 21:9).(3) The ephod mentioned in Jud 17:5; 18:14 f; Ho 3:4 is associated with teraphim and other idolatrous images. We may frankly confess that we do not know the shape, size and use of the ephod in these cases, though even here also the ephod may well have been a priestly garment. The same remark holds good of the ephod made by Gideon, and which became an object of idolatrous worship in Israel (Jud 8:27). It has been argued that a vestment would not cost seventeen hundred shekels of gold. Possibly Gideon set up an apparatus of worship containing other articles just as the mother of Micah began with the promise...</p>

The Patriarch:The younger of the two sons of Joseph and Asenath, born in Egypt. He and his brother Manasseh were adopted by Jacob, and ranked as his own sons, each becoming the ancestor of a tribe in Israel. In blessing his grandchildren, despite their father&#x27;s protest, Jacob preferred the younger, foreshadowing the future eminence of his descendants (Ge 41:50 ff; 48:20 ff). In the Blessing of Jacob however, the two are included under the name of Joseph (Ge 49:22 f).2. The Tribe:At the first census on leaving Egypt, Ephraim&#x27;s men of war numbered 40,500; and at the second census they are given as 32,500 (Nu 1:33; 26:37). See, however, article NUMBERS. The head of the tribe at the Exodus was Elishama, son of Ammihud (Nu 1:10). With the standard of the tribe of Ephraim on the West of the tabernacle in the desert march were Manasseh and Benjamin (Nu 2:18 ff). The Ephraimite among the spies was Hoshea (i.e. Joshua), the son of Nun (Nu 13:8). At the division of the land Ephraim was represented by prince Kemuel, son of Shiphtan (Nu 34:24). The future power of this tribe is again foreshadowed in the Blessing of Moses (De 33:17). When Moses died, a member of the tribe, Joshua, whose faith and courage had distinguished him among the spies, succeeded to the chief place in Israel. It was natural that the scene of national assemblies, and the center of the nation&#x27;s worship, should be chosen within the land occupied by the children of Joseph, at Shechem and Shiloh respectively. The leadership of Ephraim was further emphasized by the rule of Samuel. From the beginning of life in Palestine they enjoyed a certain prestige, and were very sensitive on the point of honor (Jud 7:24; 8:1; 12:1 ff). Their acceptance of and loyalty to Saul, the first king chosen over Israel, may be explained by his belonging to a Rachel tribe, and by the close and tender relations existing between Joseph and Benjamin. But they were never reconciled to the passing of the scepter to Judah in the person of David (2Sa 2:8 f). That Israel would have submitted to the sovereignty of Absalom, any more than to that of David, is not to be believed; but his revolt furnished an opportunity to deal a shrewd blow at the power of the southern tribe (2Sa 15:13). Solomon&#x27;s lack of wisdom and the crass folly of Rehoboam in the management of the northern tribes fanned the smoldering discontent into a fierce flame. This made easy the work of the rebel Jeroboam; and from the day of the disruption till the fall of the Northern Kingdom there was none to dispute the supremacy of Ephraim, the names Ephraim and Israel being synonymous. The most distinguished of Ephraim&#x27;s sons were Joshua, Samuel and Jeroboam I.3. The Territory:The central part of Western Palestine fell to the children of Joseph; and, while the boundaries of the territory allotted to Ephraim and Manasseh respectively are given in Jos 16; 17:1 ff, it seems to have been held by them in common for ...</p>

That it lay North of Jerusalem seems to be indicated in 2Sa 13:34. It may be identical with the Ephraim of Eusebius, Onomasticon, 20 Roman miles North of Jerusalem, and therefore to be sought somewhere in the neighborhood of Sinjil and el- Lubban. Connected with this may have been the name Aphaerema, a district in Samaria mentioned in 1 Macc 11:34; Ant, XIII, iv, 9.(2) The town near the wilderness to which Jesus retired after the raising of Lazarus (Joh 11:54). This probably corresponds to Ephrem of Eusebius, Onomasticon (s .v. &quot;Afra&quot;) 5 Roman miles East of Bethel. This may be the place named along with Bethel by Josephus (BJ, IV, ix, 9). It probably answers to eT-Taiyebeh, a large village about 4 miles North of Beitin. The antiquity of the site is attested by the cisterns and rock tombs. It stands on a high hill with a wide outlook including the plains of Jericho and the Dead Sea.See EPHRON.W. Ewing</p>

Complete Antithesis of Paul&#x27;s Teaching 14. LITERATURE===================================================================The Epicureans with the STOICS (which see) encountered Paul in Athens (Ac 17:18). They were the followers of Epicurus, a philosopher who was born in Samos in 341 BC, and who taught first in Asia Minor and afterward in Athens till his death in 270 BC. His system, unlike most philosophies, maintained its original form, with little development or dissent, to the end of its course. The views of Paul&#x27;s opponents of this school may therefore be gathered from the teaching of Epicurus.1. Social and Political Causes:The conditions for the rise of Epicureanism and Stoicism were political and social rather than intellectual. Speculative thought had reached its zenith in the great constructive ideals of Plato, and the encyclopaedic system of Aristotle. Criticism of these would necessarily drive men back upon themselves to probe deeper into the meaning of experience, as Kant did in later times. But the conditions were not propitious to pure speculation. The breaking up of the Greek city-states and the loss of Greek independence had filled men&#x27;s minds with a sense of insecurity. The institutions, laws and customs of society, which had hitherto sheltered the individual, now gave way; and men demanded from philosophy a haven of rest for their homeless and weary souls. Philosophy, therefore, became a theory of conduct and an art of living.Epicurus deprecated the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, whether as philosophy or science, and directed his inquiries to the two practical questions: What is the aim of life? and How to attain to it? Philosophy he defined as &quot;a daily business of speech and thought to secure a happy life.&quot;2. Egoistic Hedonism:His ethical teaching is therefore the central and governing factor of Epicurus&#x27; philosophy. It belongs to the type generally described as Egoistic Hedonism. The same general principles had been taught by Aristippus and his school, the Cyrenaics, a century earlier, and they were again revived in the 17th century in England by Thomas Hobbes. The aim and end of life for every man is his own happiness, and happiness is primarily defined as pleasure. &quot;Wherefore we call pleasure the Alpha and Omega of a blessed life. Pleasure is our first and kindred good. It is the starting-point of every choice and of every aversion, and to it we come back, inasmuch as we make feeling the rule by which to judge every good thing&quot; (Epicurus, Letter to Menoeceus). So far Epicurus might seem to be simply repeating the view of the Cyrenaics. But there are important differences. Aristippus held the pleasure of the moment to be the end of acti...</p>

Epistles as Distinguished from Letters 8. Patristic Epistles 9. Apocryphal Epistles========================================================================================1. New Testament Epistles:A written communication; a term inclusive of all forms of written correspondence, personal and official, in vogue from an early antiquity. As applied to the twenty-one letters, which constitute well-nigh one-half of the New Testament, the word &quot;epistle&quot; has come to have chiefly a technical and exclusive meaning. It refers, in common usage, to the communications addressed by five (possibly six) New Testament writers to individual or collective churches, or to single persons or groups of Christian disciples. Thirteen of these letters were written by Paul; three by John; two by Peter; one each by James and Jude; one--the epistle to the Hebrews--by an unknown writer.2. Distinctive Characteristics:As a whole the Epistles are classified as Pauline, and Catholic, i.e. general; the Pauline being divided into two classes: those written to churches and to individuals, the latter being known as Pastoral (1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus; some also including Philemon; see Lange on Romans, American edition, 16). The fact that the New Testament is so largely composed of letters distinguishes it, most uniquely, from all the sacred writings of the world. The Scriptures of other oriental religions--the Vedas, the Zend Avesta, the Tripitaka, the Koran, the writings of Confucius--lack the direct and personal address altogether. The Epistles of the New Testament are specifically the product of a new spiritual life and era. They deal, not with truth in the abstract, but in the concrete. They have to do with the soul&#x27;s inner experiences and processes. They are the burning and heart-throbbing messages of the apostles and their confreres to the fellow-Christians of their own day. The chosen disciples who witnessed the events following the resurrection of Jesus and received the power (Ac 1:8) bestowed by the Holy Spirit on, and subsequent to, the Day of Pentecost, were spiritually a new order of men. The only approach to them in the spiritual history of mankind is the ancient Hebrew prophets. Consequently the Epistles, penned by men who had experienced a great redemption and the marvelous intellectual emancipation and quickening that came with it, were an altogether new type of literature. Their object is personal. They relate the vital truths of the resurrection era, and the fundamental principles of the new teaching, to the individual and collective life of all believers. This specific aim accounts for the form in which the apostolic letters were written. The logic of this practical aim appears conspicuously ...</p>

Compare same Hebrew word in 1Sa 2:3, where the Lord is said to `weigh actions.&#x27; &quot;Equal,&quot; therefore, is what will bear the closest investigation and strictest judgment. In Mt 20:12, &quot;made them equal&quot; means &quot;put them upon the same footing,&quot; i.e. regarded their brief service as though it were the very same as our long hours of toil. In Lu 20:36 the context restricts the equality to a particular relation. The precise meaning of isos in Joh 5:18, &quot;making himself equal with God,&quot; is clearly defined by the preceding clause, for our Lord&#x27;s opponents say that He has &quot;called God his own Father&quot; (Greek idion patera, i.e. His Father in a peculiar and exclusive sense; compare idiou huiou of Ro 8:32, applying the same adjective to the Son in His relation to the Father, i.e. His Son in a sense in which no one else can claim the title). They correctly interpreted the language of Jesus as declaring that He was the Son of God in a way that put Him on an equality with God. The charge against Him is not that He said that He was &quot;like&quot; (homoios), but that He was &quot;equal&quot; (isos), i.e. of the very same rank and authority.H. E. Jacobs</p>

The &quot;being on an equality&quot; and the &quot;having equal prerogatives&quot; are both deductions from the possession of &quot;the form of God.&quot; The thought is that if He who had &quot;the form of God&quot; had under all circumstances exercised His Divine attributes, He would have been employing only what belonged to Him, and would in no way have derogated from what belongs only to God.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">e&#x27;-ra:We find no definite era in use in Old Testament times, and such usage does not appear until we reach the period of the Maccabees. There are some references to important events that might have served as eras had they been generally accepted and constantly employed. Such was the Exodus; and this is referred to as the starting-point in fixing the date of the building of Solomon&#x27;s temple (1Ki 6:1), and also for the date of Aaron&#x27;s death (Nu 33:38).An earthquake is referred to by Amos 1:1 as a well-known event by which to date the beginning of his prophetic career; and Ezekiel in two passages refers to the captivity of Judah as a date for marking certain events in his life. Of these the Exodus would have been the most appropriate event to use as an era, since it marked the birth of the Hebrew nation; but the universal custom of antiquity was to date from the regnal years of the kings, as we see in the history of Egypt and Babylonia and Assyria; this custom was followed by the Israelites as soon as the kingdom was established, and was continued down to the Captivity. After the return of the Jews they naturally adopted the regnal years of the Persian kings, under whose rule they were, until the overthrow of the kingdom by Alexander. After this event, the era that prevailed most widely in Syria was that of the Seleucid kingdom, which began in 312 BC, and must have been familiar to the Jews, and we have evidence that they made use of it. When Simon the Maccabee secured the independence of the Jews from the Seleucid king, Demetrius II, in 141-140, they began to date their instruments and contracts from this event as is stated in 1 Macc 13:41,42; and we find that the year of their independence is fixed by reference to the Seleucid era, the first year of Simon being the 170th of that era (see Josephus, Ant, XIII, vi, 7).After this they used the era of Simon, dating by his regnal years; but whether they used this as a permanent era during the Asmonean Dynasty or dated simply from the accession of each king, we do not know. There is no doubt that the Seleucid era continued to be used throughout the country for several centuries after the downfall of the Seleucid kingdom, as we have abundant evidence from inscriptions. When the Romans took possession of Syria and Palestine, their era was of course employed by Roman officials, but this did not prevail among the people. The dynasty of the Herods sometimes employed their own regnal years and sometimes those of the emperors, as appears from their coins. The Jews must have been familiar with the eras employed by some of the Phoenician towns, such as Tyre and Sidon. Tyre had a local era which began in 126 BC, and Sidon one beginning in 112 BC; and most of the towns on the coast used the era of Alexander, dating from the battle of Issus, until the establishment of the Seleucid era. The Jews would be familiar with these from their commercial connections with the coast towns, but we do not know that they used them...</p>

He was apparently an important person in the Corinthian community, and with Gaius probably represented that church in these fraternal relations with the Roman community.(3) Erastus is one who, in 2Ti 4:20, &quot;remained at Corinth.&quot;We have no means of discovering whether one or more than one person is meant in these references. A. C. Headlam (HDB, under the word) thinks it improbable that one who held an office implying residence in one locality should have been one of Paul&#x27;s companions in travel. On the other hand Paul may be designating Erastus (Ro 16:23) by an office he once held, but which he gave up to engage in mission work.S. F. Hunter</p>

Etymology of the Name:The second of the cities founded by Nimrod, the others being Babel, Accad and Calneh (Ge 10:10). The derivation of the name is well known, Erech being the Semitic-Babylonian Uruk, from the Sumerian Unug, a word meaning &quot;seat,&quot; probably in the sense of &quot;residential city.&quot; The character with which it is written enters into the composition of the Babylonian names of Larsa and Ur of the Chaldees.2. Position and Nature of the Ruins:Its identification with Warka, on the left bank of the Euphrates, half-way between Hillah (Babylon) and Korna, is beyond a doubt. It is thought that the Euphrates must have flowed nearer to the city in ancient times, as the Gilgames legend relates that that hero and his companion Enkidu washed their hands in the stream after having killed the divine bull sent by the goddess Ishtar to destroy them. The shape of the ruin is irregular, the course of the walls of the Northeast having been seemingly determined by that of the Nile canal (Shatt-en-Nil), which flowed on that side. The extreme length of the site from North to South is over 3,000 yds., and its width about 2,800 yds. This space is very full of remains of buildings; and the foundations of the walls, with their various windings, gateways and defenses, are traceable even now.3. Its Patron-Deities and Their Temples:Two great deities, Ishtar and Nanaa, were worshipped in this city, the temple of the former being E-anna, &quot;the house of heaven&quot; (or &quot;of Anu,&quot; in which case it is probable that the god of the heavens, Anu, was also one of the patrons of the city). The shrine dedicated to Ishtar is apparently now represented by the ruin known as Buwariyya or &quot;reed-mats,&quot; and so called on account of the layers of matting at intervals of 4 or 5 ft. This is the great temple-tower (ziq-qurat) of the place, called E-gipar-imina, &quot;the house of 7 enclosures.&quot; The remains are situated in a large courtyard measuring 350 ft. by 270 ft. As in the case of other Babylonian erections, the corners are directed toward the cardinal points, and its height is about 100 ft. above the desert-plain.As Erech is mentioned with Babylon, Niffer (Calneh) and Eridu, as one of the cities created by Merodach (Nimrod), it is clear that it was classed with the oldest foundations in Babylonia. It was the city of Gilgames, the half-mythical king of the earliest period, who seems to have restored the walls and temples. Its earliest known ruler of historical times was Ensag-kus-anna, about 4,000 BC.4. History of the City&#x27;s Temples, etc.:The celebrated shrine of Ishtar was already in existence in the time of Lugal-zaggi-si, who came somewhat later. King Dungi (2600 BC) restored E-anna and built its great wall. This was in the time of the great Ur Dynasty, but later the city seems to have come under the dominion of the kings of Isin, Libit-Ishtar having apparently restored the sanctuary of Ishtar on E- gipara. Another great ruler of the early period was Sin-gasi...</p>

The Name and Its Etymology:This is the probable Sumerian reading of the well-known Babylonian name written with the characters for &quot;servant&quot; (Sem wardu or ardu) and the group standing for the Moon-god Sin (written En-zu = Zu-en), otherwise Aku, the whole meaning &quot;servant of the Moon-god.&quot; This ruler, who was king of Larsa (ELLASAR, compare that article), is generally identified with the ARIOCH (which see) of Ge 14:9. Several Assyriologists read the name with the Semitic Babylonian pronunciation of Warad-Sin; and, if this be correct, there would be a certain amount of doubt as to the generally received identification; though this, on the other hand, might simply prove that the ancient Hebrews obtained their transcription from a Sumerian source.2. Inscriptions Mentioning Eri-Aku:In addition to a number of contract-tablets, the following inscriptions mentioning Eri-Aku or Warad-Sin are known:(1) A dedication, by Kudur-mabuk, &quot;father of Martu&quot; (Amurru, the land of the Amorites), son of Simti-Silchak, of some sacred object to the Moon-god Nannar, for his own life and that of Eri-Aku, his son, the king of Larsa.(2) A dedication, by Eri-Aku, to Ishtar of Challabu, for his own life and that of his father and begetter Kudur-mabuk. The text records the restoration of Istar&#x27;s sanctuary.(3) A dedication, by Eri-Aku, to the god Nannar, for the preservation of his own life and that of his father, Kudur-mabuk. The restoration of several temples is referred to.(4) An inscription of Eri-Aku, &quot;the powerful man,&quot; &quot;the nourisher of Ur (of the Chaldees), the king of Larsa, the king of Sumer and Akkad; son of Kudur-mabuk, the father of Emutbala.&quot; The text records that he raised the wall of Ur, called &quot;Nannar is the consolidator of the foundations of the land,&quot; high like a mountain.(5) A dedication by Eri-Aku to Nin-insina (titles as above). It records the building of the temple E-u-namtila, for his own life, and the life of Kudurmabuk, the father his begetter.3. The Nationality of His Family:These inscriptions and others show that Eri-Aku belonged to an Elamite family which held the throne of Larsa, a state which, in common with Babylonia itself, acknowledged the suzerainty of Elam. Kudurmabuk would seem, from motives of policy, to have given his sons Sumerian and Semitic Babylonian names; and it is noteworthy that he did not retain the rule of Larsa for himself, but delegated it to his offspring, keeping for himself the dominion of Emutbala and, as his own inscription shows, the land of the Amorites. With regard to these it may be noted, that the expression adda, &quot;father,&quot; probably means simply &quot;administrator.&quot;4. Eri-Aku and Rim-Sin:Eri-Aku seems to have died while his father was still alive, and was succeeded by Rim-Sin, who, as Francois Thureau-Dangin points out, must have been his brother. As in the case of Eri-Aku, Kudur-mabuk inaugurated the reign of Rim-Sin by a dedication; but there seems to be no inscription in which Rim-Sin makes a...</p>

The familiar phrase just quoted seems to have its equivalent in the marginal rendering of Ge 6:3, &quot;in their going astray they are flesh.&quot; Errors through ignorance are in the Bible distinguished from errors of the heart and willful errors (Le 5:18; Nu 15:22; Eze 45:20).W.

Sennacherib, having been slain in 681, apparently by two of his sons, who are called in the Old Testament Adrammelech and Sharezer (2Ki 19:37), Esarhaddon proceeded to Nineveh, where the rebellion which followed the death of his father collapsed, having existed for about a month and a half. The Old Testament informs us that the murderers of his father fled to Armenia. This is corroborated by the inscriptions which say that at Melid, in the land of Hanirabbat, which can be said to be in Armenia, Esarhaddon fought the rebels and defeated them; whereupon he was proclaimed king. His father had been so displeased with Babylon that he had attempted to annihilate the city by making it a swamp. Esarhaddon, however, having been infatuated with the ancient culture of the Babylonians, adopted a conciliatory attitude toward the people. Immediately he planned to restore the city on magnificent proportions. The foundations of his work were laid with impressive ceremonies, and in every way he endeavored to ameliorate the inhabitants by his gracious deeds. Even at Nippur evidences of his work in restoring the ancient shrine of Ellil are seen. The kings of the West who became his vassals, among them being Manasseh of Judah, were required to furnish building materials for his operations in Babylonia. His work in that land explains why the Judean king was incarcerated at Babylon (2Ch 33:11) instead of Assyria.Esarhaddon was first compelled to defend the kingdom against the inroads of the hordes from the North. The Gimirra (perhaps referring to Gomer of the Old Testament), who were called Manda, seemed to pour into the land. A decisive victory was finally gained over them, and they were driven back into their own country. Afterward, the Medes and the Chaldeans were also subjugated. He then directed his attentions toward the West. Sidon having revolted against Assyria, Esarhaddon laid siege to the city, which after three years was finally captured and destroyed. He built another city upon the same site, which he called Kar-Esarhaddon, and endeavored to revive its commerce. And, as is mentioned in Ezr 4:2; compare 10, he repopulated the city (Samaria) with captives from Elam and Babylonia.The capture of Tyre was also attempted, but, the city being differently situated, a siege from the land was insufficient to bring about submission, as it was impossible to cut off the commerce by sea. The siege, after several years, seems to have been lifted.

The name was given on account of the hairy covering on his body at birth: &quot;all over like a hairy garment&quot; (Ge 25:25). There was a prenatal foreshadowing of the relation his descendants were to sustain to those of his younger brother, Jacob (Ge 25:23). The moment of his birth also was signalized by a circumstance that betokened the same destiny (Ge 25:26).The young Esau was fond of the strenuous, daring life of the chase--he became a skillful hunter, &quot;a man of the field&quot; (&#x27;ish sadheh). His father warmed toward him rather than toward Jacob, because Esau&#x27;s hunting expeditions resulted in meats that appealed to the old man&#x27;s taste (Ge 25:28). Returning hungry from one of these expeditions, however, Esau exhibited a characteristic that marked him for the inferior position which had been foretokened at the time of his birth. Enticed by the pottage which Jacob had boiled, he could not deny himself, but must, at once, gratify his appetite, though the calm and calculating Jacob should demand the birthright of the firstborn as the price (Ge 25:30-34). Impulsively he snatched an immediate and sensual gratification at the forfeit of a future glory. Thus he lost the headship of the people through whom God&#x27;s redemptive purpose was to be wrought out in the world, no less than the mere secular advantage of the firstborn son&#x27;s chief share in the father&#x27;s temporal possessions. Though Esau had so recklessly disposed of his birthright, he afterward would have secured from Isaac the blessing that appertained, had not the cunning of Rebekah provided for Jacob. Jacob, to be sure, had some misgiving about the plan of his mother (Ge 27:12), but she reassured him; the deception was successful and he secured the blessing. Now, too late, Esau bitterly realized somewhat, at least, of his loss, though he blamed Jacob altogether, and himself not at all (Ge 27:34,36). Hating his brother on account of the grievance thus held against him, he determined upon fratricide as soon as his father should pass away (Ge 27:41); but the watchful Rebekah sent Jacob to Haran, there to abide with her kindred till Esau&#x27;s wrath should subside (Ge 27:42-45).Esau, at the age of forty, had taken two Hittite wives, and had thus displeased his parents. Rebekah had shrewdly used this fact to induce Isaac to fall in with her plan to send Jacob to Mesopotamia; and Esau, seeing this, seems to have thought he might please both Isaac and Rebekah by a marriage of a sort different from those already contracted with Canaanitish women. Accordingly, he married a kinswoman in the person of a daughter of Ishmael (Ge 28:6,9). Connected thus with the &quot;land of Seir,&quot; and by the fitness of that land for one who was to live by the sword, Esau was dwelling there when Jacob returned from Mesopotamia. While Jacob dreaded meeting him, and took great pains to propitiate him, and made careful preparations against a possible hostile meeting, very earnestly see...</p>

LITERATURE==========================================================================I. Doctrinal and Religious Significance.The subject of eschatology plays a prominent part in New Testament teaching and religion. Christianity in its very origin bears an eschatological character. It means the appearance of the Messiah and the inauguration of His work; and from the Old Testament point of view these form part of eschatology. It is true in Jewish theology the days of the Messiah were not always included in the eschatological age proper, but often regarded as introductory to it (compare Weber, Judische Theol. 2, 371 ff). And in the New Testament also this point of view is to some extent represented, inasmuch as, owing to the appearance of the Messiah and the only partial fulfillment of the prophecies for the present, that which the Old Testament depicted as one synchronous movement is now seen to divide into two stages, namely, the present Messianic age and the consummate state of the future. Even so, however, the New Testament draws the Messianic period into much closer connection with the strictly eschatological process than Judaism. The distinction in Judaism rested on a consciousness of difference in quality between the two stages, the content of the Messianic age being far less spiritually and transcendentally conceived than that of the final state. The New Testament, by spiritualizing the entire Messianic circle of ideas, becomes keenly alive to its affinity to the content of the highest eternal hope, and consequently tends to identify the two, to find the age to come anticipated in the present. In some cases this assumes explicit shape in the belief that great eschatological transactions have already begun to take place, and that believers have already attained to at least partial enjoyment of eschatological privileges. Thus the present kingdom in our Lord&#x27;s teaching is one in essence with the final kingdom; according to the discourses in John eternal life is in principle realized here; with Paul there has been a prelude to the last judgment and resurrection in the death and resurrection of Christ, and the life in the Spirit is the first- fruits of the heavenly state to come. The strong sense of this may even express itself in the paradoxical form that the eschatological state has arrived and the one great incision in history has already been made (Heb 2:3,1; 9:11; 10:1; 12:22-24). Still, even wh...</p>

In this article it is attempted to exhibit the beliefs on these matters contained in the Old Testament, with those in the Jewish apocryphal and apocalyptic writings that fill up the interval between the Old Testament and the New Testament.(B) Dr. Charles&#x27; Work:The subject here treated has been dealt with by many writers (see &quot;Literature&quot; below); by none more learnedly or ably than by Dr. R. H. Charles in his work on Hebrew, Jewish and Christian eschatology (A Critical History of the Doctrine of a Future Life in Israel, in Judaism, and in Christianity). The present writer is, however, unable to follow Dr. Charles in many of his very radical critical positions, which affect so seriously the view taken of the literary evidence, and of the development of Israel&#x27;s religion; is unable, therefore, to follow him in his interpretation of the religion itself. The subject, accordingly, is discussed in these pages from a different point of view from his.(C) Individual Religion in Israel.One special point in which the writer is unable to follow Dr. Charles in his treatment, which may be noticed at the outset, is in...</p>

The Name:The Greek name of the great plain in Central Palestine (Judith 3:9; 7:3, etc.). It is known in Scripture by the Hebrew name &quot;valley of Jezreel&quot; (Jos 17:16; Jud 6:33, etc.). It is called `emeq in Jud 5:15, which properly denotes &quot;a depression,&quot; or &quot;deepening,&quot; and is used more commonly of the vale running eastward between Gilboa and Little Hermon. Biq`ah is the term usually employed (2Ch 35:22, etc.), which accurately describes it, &quot;an opening,&quot; a level space surrounded by hills. The modern name is Merj ibn `Amr, &quot;meadow of the son of Amr.&quot;2. Position and Description:It lies between Gilboa and Little Hermon on the East, and Mt. Carmel on the West. It is enclosed by irregular lines drawn from the latter along the base of the foothills of Nazareth to Tabor; from Tabor, skirting Little Hermon and Gilboa to Jenin, and from Jenin along the North edge of the Samaritan uplands to Carmel. These sides of the triangle are, respectively, about 15, 15 and 20 miles in length. North of Jenin a bay of the plain sweeps eastward, hugging the foot of Mt. Gilboa. An offshoot passes down to the Jordan valley between Gilboa and Little Hermon; and another cuts off the latter hill from Tabor. The average elevation of the plain is 200 ft. above the level of the Mediterranean. The Vale of Jezreel between Zer`in and Beisan, a distance of about 12 miles, descends nearly 600 ft., and then sinks suddenly to the level of the Jordan valley. The chief springs supplying water for the plain are those at Jenin and at Megiddo. The former are the most copious, and are used to create a &quot;paradise&quot; on the edge of the plain. Those at Megiddo drive mills and serve for irrigation, besides forming extensive marshes. The springs near Zer`in, three in number, `Ain Jalud, possibly identical with the well of Harod, being the most copious, send their waters down the vale to the Jordan. The streams from the surrounding heights are gathered in the bed of the Kishon, a great trench which zigzags through the plain, carrying the water through the gorge at Carmel to the sea. For the most of its course this sluggish stream is too low to be available for irrigation. The deep, rich soil, however, retains the moisture from the winter rains until far on in the year, the surface only, where uncovered by crops, being baked to brick in the sun. When winter sets in it quickly absorbs the rain, great breadths being turned to soft mud. This probably happened in the battle with Sisera: the northern cavalry, floundering in the morass, would be an easy prey to the active, lightly armed foot-soldiers. The fertility of the plain is extraordinary: hardly anywhere can the toil of the husbandman find a greater reward. The present writer has ridden through crops of grain there, when from his seat on the saddle he could no more than see over the tops of the stalks. Trees do not flourish in the plain itsel...</p>

Versions 5. Date and AuthorshipLITERATURE======================================================================================1. Name:In some of the Greek uncials (Codex Vaticanus, etc.) of the Septuagint the book is called Esdras, Codex Alexandrinus (or Proton); so in the editions of Fritzsche, Tischendorf, Nestle and Swete. It is absent from Codex Sinaiticus and in Codex Alexandrinus its name is Ho Hiereus = The Priest, i.e. Ezra, who is emphatically the priest. It is also called 1 Esdras in the old Latin and Syriac VSS, as well as in the English, Welsh and other modern translations. In the English and other Protestant Bibles which generally print the Apocrypha apart, this book stands first in the Apocrypha under the influence partly of its name, and in part on account of its contents, as it seemed a suitable link between the canonical and the apocryphal writings. The English 2 Esdras is the apocalyptic Esdras and stands immediately after the English and Greek 1 Esdras. The Vulgate, following Jerome&#x27;s version, gave the names 1, 2 and 3 Esdras to our Ezra, Nehemiah, and 1 Esdras, respectively, and in editions of the Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 AD.) down to that of Pope Sixtus (died 1590) these three books appear in that order. The name 3 Esdras is, therefore, that current in the Roman church, and it has the sanction of the 6th article of the Anglican Creed and of Miles Coverdale who in his translation follows the Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 AD.) in naming the canonical Ezra, Nehemiah and the apocryphal 1 Esdras, 1, 2 and 3 Esdras, respectively. Other reformers adhered to these titles. In Fritzsche&#x27;s commentary on the Apocrypha 3 Esdras is preferred and he treats this book first. In Kautzsch&#x27;s German edition of the Apocrypha and in most recent German works the Latin designation 3 is revived. The English commentators Bissell (Lange) and Wace (Speaker&#x27;s Commentary) follow the custom of the Bible and speak of 1 Esdras, placing the book first in the collection, and this is the prevailing custom among English Protestant theologians. The name 2 Esdras has also been given to this book, the canonical Ezra and Nehemiah being then counted as one--1 Esdras. See Origen quoted by HE, V, 25; Zunz, Der Gottesdienst, Vortrage Berlin, 1832, 15.2. Contents:With the exception of 1 Esdras 3:1-5:6--the incident of the royal banquet and the contest for a prize of the three young men--the present books agree in everything essential, down to the minutest details, with the canonical Ezra and part of 2 Chronicles and Nehemiah. Before discussing the relation between 1 Esdras and the Biblical books named (see next section), it will be advantageous to give an outline of the book now specially under consideration, with reference to the parallel passages in the corresponding parts of the Canon. It will be seen that practically the whole of Ezr is concerned, and fo...</p>

DateLITERATURE============================================================================This book was not received by the Council of Trent as canonical, nor has it ever been acknowledged as such by the Anglican church.1. Name:The book is not found in the Septuagint and no complete copy of the Greek text is known, though at one time it did exist. The oldest extant name is &quot;The Prophet Ezra&quot; (Esdras ho prophetes; see Clement of Alexandria, Strom., iii.16): It has been often called the Latin Esdras because it exists more completely in that language; compare the name Greek Esdras for 1 Esdras.3 Esdras is the designation in old editions of the Vulgate, 1 Esdras being Ezr and Neh, 2 Esdras denoting what in English is called 1 Esdras. But in editions of the Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 AD.) later than the Council of Trent, and also in Walton&#x27;s Polyglot, Ezra is called 1 Esdras, Nehemiah, 2 Esdras, 1 Esdras = 3 Esdras, the present book (the Latin Esdras) being known as 4 Esdras. In authorized copies of the Vulgate, i.e. in those commonly used, this book is lacking. On account of its contents, Westcott, following the example of Anastasius Sinaita (bishop of Antioch from 559 AD), called the book the &quot;Apocalypse of Esdras.&quot; But as Tischendorf in 1866 edited a later and inferior work with this title the present writer suggests the name &quot;The Apocalyptic Esdras.&quot; Of all the Jewish apocalypses this is the sublimest and most pleading.See APOCALYPTIC LITERATURE, sec. II, 1, 5.2. Contents:The original work consists of 2 Esdras 3-14, chapters 1 f and 15 f being late additions. The entire book of 16 chapters exists in the Latin version only, the other versions containing chapters 3-14 only. The real 2nd (apocalyptic) Esdras, consisting of chapters 3-14, is made up of 7 visions given to Ezra in exile 30 years after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians. The drift of these visions is, How can a just and loving God allow His own people to suffer so much? The problem thus raised is fully and beautifully dealt with. For lack of space the present writer must refer for a fuller analysis to the article APOCALYPTIC LITERATURE, sec. I, 5, and the literature there cited. For 2 Esdras 1 ff and 15 ff see under ESDRAS 5 AND 6.3. Language:Though no complete text even of 2 Esdras 3-14 has survived, a careful examination of the Latin shows that it has been made from a Greek original.(1) Some fragments of the Greek can be traced, as 5:35 in Clement of Alexandria and 8:23 in the Apostolical Constitutions.(2) The order of the twelve prophets in 1:39 f follows that in the Septuagint.(3) The Latin version bears throughout clear traces of Greek idiom.Thus the gen. is used with the comparative (5:3; 11:29); we have the genitive (not ablative) absolute in 10:9, the double negative and the use of de (Greek apo) and ex (Greek ek) with the genitive in various parts.

Monachism  LITERATURE=======================================================================================When Josephus describes the sects of the Jews, he devotes most of his time and attention to the third of these sects, the Essenes. Strangely enough, although there are frequent references in the New Testament to the other two sects, the Sadducees and Pharisees, no reference has been found to the Essenes. Notwithstanding this silence of the Gospels, the prominence of this third sect is undeniable. Even in Egypt they are known. Philo, the Jewish philosopher, gives an account of these Essenes in terms that, while in the main resembling those used in Josephus, yet differ enough to prove him clearly an independent witness. Another contemporary, Pliny the Naturalist, also mentions these Essenes. Approximately a century later we have a long account of the habits and tenets of these sectaries in Hippolytus&#x27; Refutation of All Heresies. A century and a half later still Epiphanius describes these under various titles. Despite the fact that no reference to the Essenes can be found in the Gospels or the Acts, at all events under that name, there can be no doubt of their existence. Would one understand the Palestine in which our Lord&#x27;s ministry was carried on, he must comprehend the place occupied by the Essenes.I. The Name.This assumes several forms in different authors--indeed sometimes two forms appear in the same author. Josephus uses most frequently the form of the name which stands at the head of this article, but sometimes he speaks of individuals as &quot;Essaeans&quot; (BJ, II, vii, 3; viii, 4). This latter form is that preferred by Philo, a form that is adopted by Hegesippus as quoted by Eusebius, IV, 22. Pliny in his Natural History, v.15 writes &quot;Essaeans.&quot; Hippolytus also has &quot;Essenus.&quot; Epiphanius has mixed his information so that this sect appears wi...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">es-tem&#x27; (chashabh; hegeomai):&quot;To esteem&quot; means sometimes simply &quot;to think&quot; or &quot;reckon&quot;; in other connections it means &quot;to regard as honorable&quot; or &quot;valuable.&quot; We have examples of both senses in the Bible. The word most often so translated in the Old Testament is chashabh, meaning perhaps originally, &quot;to bind,&quot; hence, &quot;combine,&quot; &quot;think,&quot; &quot;reckon&quot; (Job 41:27 the King James Version; Isa 29:16,17; 53:4; La 4:2). In Isa 53:3 we have the word in the higher sense, &quot;We esteemed him not.&quot; This sense is expressed also by `arakh, &quot;to set in array,&quot; &quot;in order&quot; (Job 36:19, the King James Version &quot;Will he esteem thy riches?&quot; the English Revised Version &quot;Will thy riches suffice?&quot; margin &quot;Will thy cry avail?&quot; which the American Standard Revised Version adopts as the text); also by tsaphan, &quot;to hide,&quot; &quot;to conceal&quot; (Job 23:12, the King James Version &quot;I have esteemed the words of his mouth,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;treasured up&quot;); qalah, &quot;to be light,&quot; is translated &quot;lightly esteemed&quot; (1Sa 18:23, &quot;I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed&quot;), also qalal, same meaning (1Sa 2:30, &quot;They that despise me shall be lightly esteemed&quot;). In the New Testament, hegeomai, &quot;to lead out,&quot; is used in the sense of &quot;counting honorable,&quot; etc. (Php 2:3 the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;counting&quot;; 1Th 5:13; perhaps Heb 11:26, but the Revised Version (British and American) has simply &quot;accounting&quot;); krino, &quot;to judge,&quot; is used in the sense of &quot;to reckon&quot; (Ro 14:5 twice); also logizomai, &quot;to reckon&quot; (Ro 14:14, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;accounteth&quot;); hupselos, &quot;high,&quot; &quot;exalted,&quot; is rendered &quot;highly esteemed&quot; in Lu 16:15 the King James Version, but in the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;exalted&quot;; exoutheneo, &quot;to think nothing of,&quot; is translated &quot;least esteemed&quot; (1Co 6:4 the King James Version, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;of no account&quot;).The following changes in the Revised Version (British and American) are of interest: for &quot;He that is despised and hath a servant, is better than he that honoreth himself and lacketh bread&quot; (Pr 12:9), &quot;Better is he that is lightly esteemed&quot;; for &quot;Better is he than both they, which hath not yet been&quot; (Ec 4:3), &quot;Better than them both did I esteem him,&quot; margin &quot;Better than they both is he&quot;; for &quot;Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter&#x27;s clay&quot; (Isa 29:16), &quot;Ye turn things upside down!&quot; (margin, &quot;Oh your perversity!&quot;), &quot;Shall the potter be esteemed (the English Revised Version &quot;counted&quot;) as clay,&quot; etc.--in this connection a forcible assertion of the necessary possession of knowledge by the Creator of man.W.

She was brought up at Susa by her cousin Mordecai, who seems to have held a position among the lower officials of the royal palace. Vashti, Xerxes&#x27; former queen, was divorced; and the most beautiful virgins from all the provinces of the empire were brought to the palace of Susa that the king might select her successor. The choice fell upon the Jewish maiden. Soon after her accession a great crisis occurred in the history of the Jews. The entire people was threatened with destruction. The name of Esther is forever bound up with the record of their deliverance. By a course of action which gives her a distinguished place among the women of the Bible, the great enemy of the Jews was destroyed, and her people were delivered. Nothing more is known of her than is recorded in the book which Jewish gratitude has made to bear her name.Change of Name:The change in the queen&#x27;s name from Hadassah hadacah, &quot;a myrtle,&quot; to Esther, &quot;a star,&quot; may possibly indicate the style of beauty for which the Persian queen was famous. The narrative displays her as a woman of clear judgment, of magnificent self- control, and capable of the noblest self-sacrifice.See ESTHER, BOOK OF.John Urquhart</p>

The Attacks upon the Book 7. Some of the Objections 8. Confirmations of the BookThis book completes the historical books of the Old Testament. The conjunction &quot;w&quot; (waw = and), with which it begins, is significant. It shows that the book was designed for a place in a series, the waw linking it on to a book immediately preceding, and that the present arrangement of the Hebrew Bible differs widely from what must have been the original order. At present Esther follows Ecclesiastes, with which it has no connection whatever; and this tell-tale &quot;and,&quot; like a body- mark on a lost child, proves that the book has been wrenched away from its original connection. There is no reason to doubt that the order in the Septuagint follows that of the Hebrew Bible of the 3rd or the 4th century BC, and this is the order of the Vulgate, of the English Bible, and other VSS: The initial waw is absent from Genesis, Deuteronomy, 1 Chronicles and Nehemiah. The historical books are consequently arranged, by the insertion and the omission of waw, into these four divisions: Genesis to Numbers; Deuteronomy to 2 Kings; 1 Chronicles to Ezra; Nehemiah and Esther.=========================================================================1. The Canonicity of Esther:Of the canonicity of the book there is no question. That there was a distinct guardianship of the Canon by the Jewish priesthood has figured less in recent discussions than it should. Josephus shows that there was a Temple copy which was carried among the Temple spoils in the triumph of Vespasian. The peculiarities of the Hebrew text also prove that all our manuscripts are representatives of one standard copy. In the Jewish Canon Esther had not only a recognized, but also a distinguished, place. The statement of Junilius in the 6th century AD that the canonicity of Esther was doubted by some in his time has no bearing on the question. The high estimation of the book current among the ancient Jews is evident from its titles. It is usually headed &quot;Megillath Esther&quot; (the volume of Esther), and sometimes &quot;Megillah&quot; (the volume). Maimonides says that the wise men among the Jews affirm that the book was dictated by the Holy Spirit, and adds: &quot;All the books of the Prophets, and all the Hagiographa shall cease in the days of the Messiah, except the volume of Esther; and, lo, that shall be as stable as the Pentateuch, and as the constitutions of the oral law which shall never cease.&quot;2. Its Authorship:By whom was the book written? This is a point in regard to which no help is afforded us either by the contents of the book or by any reliable tradition. Mordecai, whose claims have been strongly urged by some, is excluded by the closing words (Es 10:3), which sum up his life work and the blessings of which he had been the recipient. The words imply that when the book was written, that great Israelite had passed away.3. Its Date:Li...</p>

DateLITERATURE==================================================================================Introductory.The Book of Esther in the oldest manuscripts of the Septuagint (BAN, etc.) contains 107 verses more than in the Hebrew Bible. These additions are scattered throughout the book where they were originally inserted in order to supply the religious element apparently lacking in the Hebrew text. In Jerome&#x27;s version and in the Vulgate, which is based on it, the longest and most important of these additions are taken out of their context and put together at the end of the canonical book, thus making them to a large extent unintelligible. In English, Welsh and other Protestant versions of the Scriptures the whole of the additions appear in the Apocrypha.1. Name:In the English Versions of the Bible the full title is &quot;The Rest of the Chapters of the Book of Esther, which are found neither in the Hebrew, nor in the Chaldee.&quot; Since in the Septuagint, including the editions by Fritzsche, Tischendorf and Swete, these chapters appear in their original context, they bear no separate title. The same is true of Brereton&#x27;s English translation of the Septuagint; but in Thompson&#x27;s translation the whole of the Apocrypha is omitted, so that it is not strictly a translation of the whole Septuagint.2. Contents:In Swete&#x27;s edition of the Septuagint the interpretations constituting &quot;the Rest of Esther&quot; (sometimes given as &quot;Additions to Esther&quot;) are designated by the capital letters of the alphabet, and in the following enumeration this will be followed. The several places in the Greek Bible are indicated in each case.A (Latin, English, Ad Es 11:2; 12:6): Mordecai&#x27;s dream; how he came to honor. Precedes Es 1:1.B (Latin, English, Ad Es 13:1-7): Letter of Artaxerxes. Follows Es 3:13.C (Latin, English, Ad Es 13:8-14:19): The prayers of Mordecai and Esther. Follows Es 4:17.D (Latin, Ad Es 15:4-19; English, 16:1-16): Esther visits the king and wins his favor. Follows C, preceding immediately Es 5.E (Latin, English, Ad Es 16:1-24): Another letter of Artaxerxes. Follows Es 8:12.  F (Latin, English, Ad Es 10:4-11): Epilogue describing the origin of the Feast Purim. Follows Es 10:3.But besides the lengthy interpolations noticed above there are also in the Septuagint small additions omitted from the Latin and therefore from the English, Welsh, etc., Apocrypha. These short additions are nearly all explanatory glosses. In the Century Bible (Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther) the exact places where the insertions occur in the Septuagint are indicated and described in the notes dealing with the relevant passages of the canonical text. With the help thus given any English reader is able to read the additions in their original setting. Unless they are read in this way they are pointless and even in most cases senseless.3. Original Language:All scholars agree that &quot;The Rest of Esther&quot; was written originally in Greek Both...</p>

In 2Ch 11:6 it occurs, between Bethlehem and Tekoa, as one of the cities built &quot;for defense in Judah&quot; by Rehoboam. Josephus writes that &quot;there was a certain place, about 50 furlongs distant from Jerusalem which is called Ethan, very pleasant it is in fine gardens and abounding in rivulets of water; whither he (Solomon) used to go out in the morning&quot; (Ant., VIII, vii, 3). Mention of `Ain `Aitan, which is described as the most elevated place in Palestine, occurs in the Talmud (Zebhachim 54b), and in the Jer. Talmud (Yoma&#x27; 3 fol 41) it is mentioned that a conduit ran from `Atan to the Temple.The evidence all points to `Ain `Atan, the lowest of the springs supplying the aqueduct running to Solomon&#x27;s pools. The gardens of Solomon may very well--by tradition, at any rate--have been in the fertile valley below `Urtas. The site of the ancient town Etam is rather to be looked for on an isolated hill, with ancient remains, a little to the East of `Ain `Atan. 1Ch 4:3 may also have reference to this Etam.(2) A town assigned to Simeon (1Ch 4:32).

The rocky hill on which lies the village of Beit `Atab, near Sur`ah (Zorah), was suggested by Conder, but unless (3) is really identical width (1), which is quite possible, the cavern known as `Arak Isma`in, described by Hanauer (PEFS, 1886, 25), suits the requirements of the story better. The cavern, high up on the northern cliffs of the Wady Isma`in, is a noticeable object from the railway as the train enters the gorge.E. W. G. Masterman</p>

          </div>
<p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">e-tur&#x27;-nal (`olam; aionios, from aion):The word &quot;eternal&quot; is of very varying import, both in the Scriptures and out of them.1. `Olam:In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word `olam is used for &quot;eternity,&quot; sometimes in the sense of unlimited duration, sometimes in the sense of a cycle or an age, and sometimes, in later Hebrew, in the signification of world. The Hebrew `olam has, for its proper New Testament equivalent, aion, as signifying either time of particular duration, or the unending duration of time in general. Only, the Hebrew term primarily signified unlimited time, and only in a secondary sense represented a definite or specific period. Both the Hebrew and the Greek terms signify the world itself, as it moves in time.2. Aion, Aionios:In the New Testament, aion and aionios are often used with the meaning &quot;eternal,&quot; in the predominant sense of futurity. The word aion primarily signifies time, in the sense of age or generation; it also comes to denote all that exists under time- conditions; and, finally, superimposed upon the temporal is an ethical use, relative to the world&#x27;s course. Thus aion may be said to mean the subtle informing spirit of the world or cosmos--the totality of things. By Plato, in his Timaeus, aion was used of the eternal Being, whose counterpart, in the sense-world, is Time. To Aristotle, in speaking of the world, aion is the ultimate principle which, in itself, sums up all existence.. In the New Testament, aion is found combined with prepositions in nearly three score and ten instances, where the idea of unlimited duration appears to be meant. This is the usual method of expressing eternity in the Septuagint also. The aionios of 2Co 4:18 must be eternal, in a temporal use or reference, else the antithesis would be gone.3. Aidios:In Ro 1:20 the word aidios is used of Divine action and rendered in the King James Version &quot;eternal&quot; (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;everlasting&quot;), the only other place in the New Testament where the word occurs being Jude 1:6, where the rendering is &quot;everlasting,&quot; which accords with classical usage. But the presence of the idea of eternal in these passages does not impair the fact that aion and aionios are, in their natural and obvious connotation, the usual New Testament words for expressing the idea of eternal, and this holds strikingly true of the Septuagint usage also. For, from the idea of aeonian life, there is no reason to suppose the notion of duration excluded. The word aionios is sometimes used in the futurist signification, but often also, in the New Testament, it is concerned rather with the quality, than with the quantity or duration, of life. By the continual attachment of aionios to life, in this conception of the spiritual or Divine life in man, the aeonian conception was saved from becoming sterile.4. Enlargement of Idea:In the use of aion and aionios there is evidenced a certain enlarging or advancing import till they come so to express the high and complex fact of ...</p>

In the New Testament 4. The Eternal &quot;Now&quot; 5. Defect of This View 6. Philosophical Views 7. Time Conceptions Inadequate 8. All Succession Present in One Act to Divine Consciousness 9. Yet Connection between Eternity and Time 10. The Religious Attitude to EternityLITERATURE=========================================================================1. Contrast with Time:Eternity is best conceived, not in the merely negative form of the non-temporal, or immeasurable time, but positively, as the mode of the timeless self-existence of the Absolute Ground of the universe. The flux of time grows first intelligible to us, only when we take in the thought of God as eternal--exalted above time. Timeless existence--being or entity without change--is what we here mean by eternity, and not mere everlastingness or permanence through time. God, in His internal being, is raised above time; in His eternal absoluteness, He is throned above temporal development, and knows, as the Scriptures say, no changeableness. The conception of eternity, as without beginning or ending, leaves us with but a negation badly in need of filling out with reality. Eternity is not a mere negative idea; to make of eternity merely a blank and irrelevant negation of temporality would not satisfy any proper theory of being; it functions as the positive relation to time of that eternal God, who is King of all the eons.2. In the Old Testament:In the Old Testament, God&#x27;s eternity is only negatively expressed, as implying merely indefinitely extended time (Ge 21:33; De 33:27), though Isa 40:28 takes more absolute form. Better is the view of eternity, objectively considered, as a mode of being of God in relation to Himself. For He was eternal, while as yet the world and time were not. But even in the New Testament, the negative form of expression prevails.3. In the New Testament:Time, with its succession of events, helps to fill out such idea as we can form of the eternal, conceived as an endless progress. But, as finite beings, we can form no positive idea of eternity. Time is less contradictory of eternity, than helpful in revealing what we know of it. Plato, in his Timaeus, says that time is the &quot;moving image of eternity,&quot; and we may allow that it is its type or revelation. Not as the annulment of time, though it might be held to be in itself exclusive of time, is eternity to be taken, but rather as the ground of its reality.4. The Eternal &quot;Now&quot;:Eternity might, no doubt, be taken as just time no longer measured by the succession of events, as in the finite universe. But, on a strict view, there is something absurd in an eternity that includes time, and an eternity apart from time is a vain and impossible conception. Eternity, as a discharge from all time limits, is purely negative, though not without importance. Eternity, absolutely taken, must be pronounced incommensurable with time; as Aquinas ...</p>

At Etham (Ex 13:20), the Hebrews camped in the &quot;edge,&quot; or at &quot;the end,&quot; of the desert West of the sea that they were to cross (see EXODUS). This camp was probably near the North end of the Bitter Lakes, a march from Succoth. Brugsch (Hist. Egypt, II, 359) would compare Etham with the Egyptian Khetam (&quot;fort&quot;), but the Hebrew word has no guttural. The word Khetam is not the name of a place (see Pierret, Vocab. hieroglyph., 453), and more than one such &quot;fort&quot; seems to be noticed (see PITHOM). In the reign of Seti II a scribe&#x27;s report mentions the pursuit of two servants, apparently from Zoan, to the fortress of I-k-u southward, reaching Khetam on the 3rd day; but if this was the &quot;Khetam of Rameses II,&quot; or even that &quot;of Minepthah,&quot; it would not apparently suit the position of Etham.See MIGDOL.C.

Conclusion Absoluteness, Inwardness and Universality  LITERATURE======================================================================In this article, which proposes to be of a general and introductory character, we shall first deal with the nature and function of ethics generally, showing its difference from and relation to other cognate branches of inquiry. Secondly, we shall sketch briefly the history of ethics in so far as the various stages of its development bear upon and prepare the way for Christian ethics, indicating also the subsequent course of ethical speculation. Thirdly, we shall give some account of Biblical ethics; treating first of the main moral ideas contained in the Old Testament, and enumerating, secondly, the general principles and leading characteristics which underlie the ethical teaching of the New Testament.I. Nature and Function of Ethics.Ethics is that branch of philosophy which is concerned with human character and conduct. It deals with man, not so much as a subject of knowledge, as a source of action. It has to do with life or personality in its inward dispositions, outward manifestations and social relations. It was Aristotle who first gave to this study its name and system...</p>

In the Synoptic Gospels.If, following the custom prevalent at present, we adopt, as the general name for the teaching of Jesus in the Synoptists, the Kingdom of God, then the divisions of His ethical teaching will be (1) the Blessings of the Kingdom, (2) the Character of the Subjects, (3) the Commandments of the King.1. The Blessings of the Kingdom:(1) Nature of the Kingdom.&quot;The Kingdom of God&quot; was not a phrase invented by Jesus. It was used before Him by the Baptist. Its proximate source, for both Jesus and John, was the prophet Daniel, who uses it in very striking passages (2:44,45; 7:13,14). The idea of a kingdom of God goes back to the very commencement of the monarchy in Israel, when the prophet Samuel told those who demanded a king that Yahweh was their king, and that they should desire no other. Through all the subsequent history of the monarchy, which was, on the whole, so disappointing to patriotic and pious minds, the conviction lingered that, if God Himself were king, all would be well; and, when at length the Hebrew state was destroyed and the people were carried into captivity, the prophets still believed that for their country there was a future and a hope, if only Yahweh would take to Himself His great power and reign. In the period between the Old Testament and the New Testament such sentiments so greatly prevailed that Schurer has compiled, from the apocryphal literature, a kind of Messianic creed, embracing no fewer than eleven articles, which he supposes to have prevailed before the Advent. It may be doubtful how far such beliefs had taken possession of the general mind. Many of the Sadducees were too satisfied with things as they were to concern themselves about such dreams. But the Pharisees undoubtedly gave a large place in their minds to Messianic expectations, and for these the Zealots were ready to fight. It is, however, to the prosdechomenoi, as they are called, because they were &quot;waiting for the consolation of Israel,&quot; that we must look for the purest expression of this heritage derived from the piety of the past. In the hymns at the beginning of the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, with which the birth of Jesus was greeted, we encou...</p>

Location, Extent and Population:Critically speaking Ethiopia may refer only to the Nile valley above the First Cataract, but in ancient as in modern times the term was often used not only to include what is now known as Nubia and the Sudan (Soudan), but all the unknown country farther West and South, and also at times Northern, if not Southern, Abyssinia. While Ethiopia was so indefinitely large, yet the narrow river valley, which from the First to the Fifth Cataract represented the main agricultural resources of the country, was actually a territory smaller than Egypt and, excluding deserts, smaller than Belgium (W. Max Muller). The settled population was also small, since in ancient as in modern times Egypt naturally drew away most of the able-bodied and energetic youth as servants, police and soldiers. The prehistoric population of Northern Nubia was probably Egyptian but this was displaced in early historic time by a black race, and the thick lips and woolly hair of the typical African are as well marked in the oldest Egyptian paintings as in the latest. But by the side of these natives of K&#x27;sh, the artist also represents various reddish-brown varieties; for from the beginning of historic time the pure Negro stock has been mixed with the fellaheen of Egypt and with the Sere population of the Arabian coast. The rulers of Ethiopia were generally of foreign blood. The Negroes, though brave and frugal, were slow in thought, and although controlled for centuries by cultivated neighbors, under whom they attained at times high official prominence, yet the body of the people remained uninfluenced by this civilization. The country which we now know as Abyssinia was largely controlled, from the earliest known date, by a Caucasian people who had crossed the Red Sea from Arabia. The true Abyssinians, as Professor Littmann shows, contain no Negro blood and no Negro qualities. In general they are &quot;well formed and handsome, with straight and regular features, lively eyes, hair long and straight or somewhat curled and in color dark olive approaching brown.&quot; Modern discoveries prove their close racial and linguistic connection with Southern Arabia and particularly with the kingdom of Sheba (the Sabeans), that most powerful people whose extensive architectural and literary remains have recently come to light. The Sabean inscriptions found in Abyssinia go back some 2,600 years and give a new value to the Bible references as well as to the constant claim of Josephus that the queen of Sheba was a &quot;queen of Ethiopia.&quot; The Falashas are a Jewish community living near Lake Tsana, of the same physical type and probably of the same race as other Abyssinians. Their religion is a &quot;pure Mosaism&quot; based upon the Ethiopic version of the Pentateuch, but modified by the fact that they are ignorant of the Hebrew language (Jewish Encyclopedia). It is uncertain when they became Jews. The older scholars thought of them as dating back to the Solom...</p>

Being a eunuch, he was not in the full Jewish communion (compare De 23:1), but had gone up to Jerusalem to worship, probably as a proselyte at the gate. During his return journey he spent the time in studying Isaiah, the text which he used being that of the Septuagint (compare Professor Margoliouth, article &quot;Ethiopian Eunuch&quot; in HDB). On meeting with Philip the deacon, who was on his way to Gaza, he besought of him to shed light upon the difficulties of the Scripture he was reading, and through this was converted. The place of his baptism, according to Jerome and Eusebius, was Bethsura: by some modern authorities, eg. G A. Smith, it has been located at or near Gaza. The verse containing the confession of the eunuch, &quot;I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God,&quot; is omitted either in whole or in part by some texts, but Hilgenfeld, Knowling, etc., regard it as quite in keeping with the context. Tischendorf, Westcott and Hort, Revised Version (British and American) text, etc., uphold the omission. The verse occurs in the body of the King James Version, but is given only as a footnote in the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version. The diligence with which the eunuch pursued his reading, the earnestness with which he inquired of Philip, and the promptness with which he asked for baptism--all testify to the lofty nature of his character.C.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">e-thi-op&#x27;-ik lan&#x27;-gwaj:The language commonly called Ethiopic is the language in which the inscriptions of the kings of the ancient Aksumitic (Axumite) empire and most of the literature of Christian Abyssinia are written. It is called lesana Ge`ez, &quot;the tongue of Ge`ez,&quot; by the Abyssinians themselves, most probably because it was originally the dialect of the Ge`ez tribe, who in antiquity must have dwelt in or near Aksum (Axum).The names Ethiopia and Ethiopians have been used in many different meanings by various peoples. To the Greeks, Ethiopia was a country South of Egypt, and in this sense the word is generally used in the histories of Egypt. The Ethiopian kings came from that country which is now called Nubia in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. In Hellenistic times the term received a wider meaning, and Ethiopia was the name of all the land between the Red Sea and the Nile, south of Egypt proper. Sometimes &quot;Indian&quot; and &quot;Ethiopian&quot; were synonymous, or Ethiopia was even considered to stretch as far as to the Atlantic Ocean in the West. But of these countries the Greeks and Romans had very little exact geographical knowledge.See ETHIOPIA.The fact that Ethiopia at some time meant the country between the Red Sea and the Nile prompted the pagan kings of Aksum in northern Abyssinia to adopt this name for their own country and to give it a narrower sense than the one which it had at that time. Therefore in the bilingual inscription of King Aeizanas (`Ezana), the word Aithiopia, is a rendering of the Semitic Chabashat (&quot;Abyssinia,&quot; but here more specially referring to Northern Abyssinia). Under this same king, about 350 AD, Abyssinia became Christian; and after the Bible had been translated into the Ge`ez language, the Abyssinians found that Ethiopia was mentioned there several times. Their national pride was flattered by the thought that their country should be referred to in the Holy Scriptures, and for this reason they were all the more ready to apply the name in question to their own country. Up to the present day they call it Ethiopia (&#x27;Itiopiya), and themselves Ethiopians; their legends speak even of an ancestor Itiopis.We may then, if we choose to do so, speak of a Nubian and an Abyssinian Ethiopia, but the term &quot;Ethiopic language&quot; has come into general usage as an equivalent of lesana Ge`ez, and should therefore be applied only to the ancient literary language of Abyssinia.This language is closely allied to the languages of Southern Arabia: it represents the southwestern branch of the southern division of the Semitic languages. The most important branch of this division is, of course, the Arabic language, and with this Ethiopic has a great deal in common. On the other hand there are many words and forms in Ethiopic which are not found in Arabic, but in Hebrew or even in Babylonian and Assyrian. It has been held that the home of the Semites was in Africa; and if that were the case, the people who spoke the Ethiopic language may never have migrated very...</p>

The Bible was translated into Ethiopic, or, to use the native name, Ge`ez, the Old Testament being from the Septuagint, between the 4th and 5th centuries, by various hands, though the work was popularly ascribed to Frumentius, the first bishop. The fact of the Scriptures having been translated into Ethiopic was known to Chrysostom (Hom. II, in Joannem). The versions thus made were revised some time about the 14th century, and corrected by means of the Massoretic Text. The Ethiopic Scriptures contain the books found in the Alexandrine recension with the exception of the Books of Macc; but their importance lies in their pseudepigraphic writings, the Asc Isa, the Book of Enoch and the Book of Jubilees. The 1st edition of the New Testament appeared at Rome in 1545-49 (reprinted in Walton), but a critical edition has yet to be made; one issued by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1830 contains many errors. The Old Testament canonical books and Apocrypha have been edited by Dillmann (the Octoteuch and 1-4 Kings and Apocrypha), Bachmann (died 1894) (Isa, Lam, Ob and Mal), and Ludolph (Pss). The Psalter has been often printed from 1513 on. The Book of Enoch was first translated by Richard Laurence and published at Oxford in 1821, but the standard editions are those of Dillmann (Leipzig, 1853) and R. H. Charles (Oxford, 1893). The importance of this work lies in the fact that &quot;the influence of Enoch on the New Testament has been greater than that of all the other apocryphal and pseudepigraphal books taken together&quot; (Charles, 41). Not only the phraseology and ideas, but the doctrines of the New Testament are greatly influenced by it. Of the canonical books and Apocrypha the manuscripts are too poor and too late to be of any value for the criticism of the Greek text.Thomas Hunter Weir</p>

In these circumstances when the desertion of Paul by the Christians in Rome was so disheartening, it is pleasing to find that there were some among them who were true, and Eubulus was one of these. Paul therefore in writing the last of all his epistles sends to Timothy a greeting from Eubulus.Nothing more is known in regard to Eubulus. As his name is Greek, he was probably a Gentile by birth.

He is mentioned in the Apocrypha (1 Macc 8:8) in connection with the league which Judas Maccabeus made with the Romans. As their ally in the war against Antiochus the Great and in recognition of his signal service at the decisive battle of Magnesia (190 BC), Eumenes II was rewarded with such extensive tracts of country as raised him at once from comparative insignificance to be the sovereign of a great state. The statement in the Apocrypha describing his extension of territory differs from those of Livy, Polybius and Appian, and cannot be correct.The Romans are said to have taken &quot;India, and Media and Lydia&quot; from Antiochus and to have given them to Eumenes II. Antiochus never had any possessions in India nor had any earlier king of Syria. He was obliged to give up only the countries on the side of Taurus toward Rome. No suggestion for the reading &quot;India&quot; in the narrative has met with acceptance (it may possibly have been a copyist&#x27;s error for &quot;Ionia&quot;; see Livy xxxvii.44). Eumenes II cultivated the Roman alliance carefully but became suspected in connection with the affairs of Perseus, the last king of Macedonia. He never came to an open rupture with the Romans, and died in 159 BC, after a reign of 39 years.J. Hutchison</p>

Eunice&#x27;s Home:Her name is Greek and this might lead to the inference that she was a Gentile by birth, but such a conclusion would be wrong, for we read in Ac 16:1 that she was a Jewess. Her husband however was a heathen Greek She was in all probability a daughter of Lois, the grandmother of Timothy, for both of those Christian women are spoken of, in one breath, by Paul, and this in high terms of commendation.2. How She Trained Her Son:Timothy had not been circumcised in childhood, probably because of his father&#x27;s being a Gentile; but the mother and the grandmother did all that lay in their power to train Timothy in the fear of God and in the knowledge of the Scriptures of the Old Testament. &quot;From a child&quot; Eunice had taught her boy to &quot;know the holy scriptures&quot; (2Ti 3:15 the King James Version). It is right therefore to connect this home training of Timothy in the fear of God, with his and his mother&#x27;s conversion to the gospel. His name Timothy--chosen evidently not by the father, but by Eunice-- signifies &quot;one who fears God.&quot; The &quot;wisdom&quot; of the Hebrews consisted not in worldly prudence or in speculative philosophy, but in the fear of the Lord, as is shown in such passages as Ps 111:10, and in Job 28, and in Proverbs throughout. His name, as well as his careful home training, shows how he was prepared to give a welcome both to Paul and to the gospel proclaimed by him, when the apostle in his first great missionary journey came to Lystra, one of the cities of Lycaonia or Southern (?) Galatia, where Eunice and her family lived. This is implied in the account of Paul&#x27;s second missionary journey (Ac 16:1), where we read that he came to Lystra, and found there a certain disciple named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman who was a Jewess, who believed.3. Her Conversion to Christ:It is therefore certain that Eunice and Timothy were not brought to a knowledge of the gospel at this time, but that they were already Christians; she, &quot;a believer&quot;; he, &quot;a disciple.&quot; This evidently means that Eunice, Lois and Timothy had been converted on Paul&#x27;s former visit to Lystra. This conclusion is confirmed in 2Ti 3:11, where Paul recalls to Timothy the fact that he had fully known the persecutions and afflictions which came to him at Lystra. The apostle repeats it, that Timothy knew what persecutions he then endured. Now this persecution occurred on Paul&#x27;s first visit to that city. Eunice was therefore one of those who on that occasion became &quot;disciples.&quot; And her faith in Christ, and her son&#x27;s faith too, were genuine, and stood the test of the &quot;much tribulation&quot; of which Paul warned them (Ac 14:22 the King James Version); and on Paul&#x27;s next visit to Lystra, Eunice had the great joy and satisfaction of seeing how the apostle made choice of he...</p>

The barbarous practice of self-mutilation and the mutilation of others in this way was prevalent throughout the Orient. The religious disabilities under which men thus deformed labored under the Mosaic law had the effect of making the practice abominable to the Jews as a people (De 23:1; Le 22:23-25). The law excluded eunuchs from public worship, partly because self- mutilation was often performed in honor of a heathen god, and partly because a maimed creature of any sort was deemed unfit for the service of Yahweh (Le 21:16 ff; 22:24). That ban, however, was later removed (Isa 56:4,5). On the other hand, the kings of Israel and Judah followed their royal neighbors in employing eunuchs (1) as guardians of the harem (2Ki 9:32; Jer 41:16), and (2) in military and other official posts (1Sa 8:15 margin; 1Ki 22:9 margin; 2Ki 8:6 margin; 2Ki 23:11 the King James Version margin; 2Ki 24:12,13 margin; 2Ki 25:19 margin; 1Ch 28:1 margin; 2Ch 18:8 margin; Jer 29:2; 34:19; 38:7; compare Ge 37:36; 40:2,7; Ac 8:27). Josephus informs us that eunuchs were a normal feature of the courts of the Herods (Ant., XV, vii, 4; XVI, viii, 1). From the single reference to the practice in the Gospels (Mt 19:12), we infer that the existence and purpose of eunuchs as a class were known to the Jews of Jesus&#x27; time. There is no question with Jesus as to the law of Nature: the married life is the norm of man&#x27;s condition, and the union thereby effected transcends every other natural bond, even that of filial affection (Mt 19:5,6).But He would have His hearers recognize that there are exceptional cases where the rule does not hold. In speaking of the three classes of eunuchs (Mt 19:12), He made a distinction which was evidently well known to those whom He addressed, as was the metaphorical use of the word in application to the third class well understood by them (compare Lightfoot, Horae Hebrew et Talmud; Schottgen, Horae Hebrew, in the place cited.).How Origen misunderstood and abused the teaching of this passage is well known (Euseb., HE, VI, 8), and his own pathetic comment on the passage shows that later he regretted having taken it thus literally and acted on it. His is not the only example of such a perverted interpretation (see Talmud, Shabbath 152a, and compare Midrash on Ec 10:7). The Council of Nicea, therefore, felt called on to deal with the danger as did the 2nd Council of Aries and the Apos Canons (circa 21). (Compare Bingham&#x27;s Ant, IV, 9.)It is significant that Jesus expresses no condemnation of this horrible practice. It was in keeping with His far-reaching plan of instilling principles rather than dealing in denu...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">1. Women Prominent in Church at Philippi:The Textus Receptus of the New Testament of Stephen reads Euodia, which means &quot;fragrant,&quot; Php 4:2. King James Version has transformed Euodia into Euodias, which is a man&#x27;s name. The mistake is rectified in the Revised Version (British and American): A Christian woman, one of the members of the church in Philippi. She and Syntyche, who is named in the same verse, were evidently persons of note, prominent in the work of the church there. At Philippi the gospel was first preached to women Ac 16:13, and the church was first formed among women--evidently in the house of Lydia Ac 16:15,40. Paul here makes a request of Euodia and Syntyche. He requests--the word is never used of prayer from us to God--he asks, he beseeches. Euodia, and then he repeats the word, he beseeches Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord. Possibly, as Lightfoot suggests, they may have been deaconesses in the Philippian church, but whatever their position in this respect may have been, differences had arisen between them on some subject, we know not what.2. The Difference Which Arose:But whatever the subject in dispute was, it had become so serious that, instead of the breach being healed, matters had become chronic; and news regarding this lack of forbearance between Euodia and Syntyche had been carried to Paul in his captivity in Rome.3. Paul Entreats Them:The state of Christian life in the church at Philippi gave Paul almost unmingled satisfaction. He regarded with joy their faith and steadfastness and liberality. There was no false teaching, no division; among them. The only thing which could cause him any uneasiness was the want of harmony between Euodia and Syntyche. He beseeches them to give up their differences, and to live at peace in the Lord. Such is the motive which he puts before them with a view to bring about their reconciliation; to live in dispute and enmity is not worthy of those who are &quot;in the Lord,&quot; who have been redeemed by the Lord, and whose whole life should be an endeavor to please Him.4. The True Yokefellow:Paul proceeds to ask a certain person, unnamed, but whom he terms &quot;true yokefellow&quot; to assist them, that is, to assist Euodia and Syntyche; for each of them, he says, &quot;labored with me in the gospel.&quot; It is uncertain what is meant by &quot;true yokefellow.&quot; He may refer to Epaphroditus, who carried the epistle from Rome to Philippi. Other names have been suggested-- Luke, Silas, Timothy. It has been thought by some that Paul here refers to his own wife, or to Lydia. But such a suggestion is untenable, inasmuch as we know from his own words (1Co 7:8) that he was either unmarried or a widower. And the idea that the &quot;true yokefellow&quot; is Lydia, is equally wrong, because the word &quot;true&quot; is in the Greek masculine Another suggestion is that &quot;yokefellow&quot; is really a proper name--Syzygus. If so, then the apostle addresses Syzygus; or if this is not so, then he speaks to the unnamed &quot;true yokefellow&quot;; and what he says is...</p>

In the absence of Philip, a friend and foster-brother of the child&#x27;s father, whom on his deathbed he had appointed guardian for his son, Lysias continued his duty as guardian, set the king upon the throne and named him Eupator. Shortly after his accession he collected a large army and marched against Jerusalem, accompanied by Lysias, for the relief of a Syrian garrison that was hard pressed by Judas Maccabeus ( /APC 1Macc 6:19 ff). Judas was repulsed at Bethzacharias and after a severe struggle Bethsura was captured ( /APC 1Macc 6:31-50). The Jewish force in the temple was hard pressed and indeed reduced to the last extremity ( /APC 1Macc 6:53), when Lysias, hearing that his rival Philip had returned from Persia and had made himself master of Antioch (Josephus, Ant, XII, ix, 5 f), made a hasty peace and returned to meet Philip, whom he easily overpowered. In the following year (162 BC) Antiochus and Lysias were put to death by Demetrius Soter, son of Seleucus, in requital of wrongs inflicted upon himself by Antiochus Epiphanes (/APC 1Macc 7:2-4; 2Macc 14:1,2; Josephus, Ant, XII, x, 1).J.

The upper division traverses the mountainous plateau of Armenia, and is formed by the junction of 2 branches, the Frat and the Murad. The Frat rises 25 miles Northeast of Erzerum, and only 60 miles from the Black Sea. The Murad, which, though the shorter, is the larger of the two, rises in the vicinity of Mt. Ararat. After running respectively 400 and 270 miles in a westerly direction, they unite near Keban Maaden, whence in a tortuous channel of about 300 miles, bearing still in a southwesterly direction, the current descends in a succession of rapids and cataracts to the Syrian plain, some distance above the ancient city of Carchemish, where it is only about 200 miles from the Northeast corner of the Mediterranean. In its course through the Armenian plateau, the stream has gathered the sediment which gives fertility to the soil in the lower part of the valley. It is the melting snows from this region which produce the annual floods from April to June.The middle division, extending for about 700 miles to the bitumen wells of Hit, runs Southeast &quot;through a valley of a few miles in width, which it has eroded in the rocky surface, and which, being more or less covered with alluvial soil, is pretty generally cultivated by artificial irrigation. .... Beyond the rocky banks on both sides is the open desert, covered in spring with a luxuriant verdure, and dotted here and there with the black tent of the Bedouin&quot; (Sir Henry Rawlinson). Throughout this portion the river formed the ancient boundary between the Assyrians and Hittites whose capital was at Carchemish, where there are the remains of an old bridge. The ruins of another ancient bridge occur 200 miles lower down at the ancient Thapsacus, where the Greeks forded it under Cyrus the younger. Throughout the middle section the stream is too rapid to permit of successful navigation except by small boats going downstream, and has few and insignificant tributaries. It here has, however, its greatest width (400 yds.) and depth. Lower down the water is drawn off by irrigating canals and into lagoons.The fertile plain of Babylonia begins at Hit, about 100 miles above Babylon; 50 miles below Hit the Tigris and Euphrates approach to within 25 miles of each other, and together have in a late geological period deposited the plain of Shinar or of Chaldea, more definitely referred to as Babylonia. This plain is about 250 miles long, and in its broadest place 100 miles wide. From Hit an artificial canal conducts water along the western edge of the alluvial plain to the Persian Gulf, a distance of about 500 miles. But the main irrigating canals put off from the East side of the Euphrates, and can be traced all over the plain past t...</p>

A critical estimate of the narrative ( /APC 1Macc 8 and Josephus, Ant, XII, x, 6) of the first meeting of the representatives of the Jewish nation and the Romans will be found in Stanley, Lectures on the History of the Jewish Church, III, 350 ff, where it is admitted that &quot;inaccuracies of detail only confirm the general faithfulness of the impression.&quot; Keil (Comm., 14) further remarks on this point: &quot;that the author of 1 Macc wrote from twenty to twenty-five years after the destruction of Corinth (146 BC) by the Romans; and that the Jews of Palestine were not accurately informed concerning the wars of the Romans with the Greeks.&quot; Eupolemus has been identified with the historian of the same name quoted by Eusebius (Praep.

The term seems to have been the sailor&#x27;s term for that particular wind, and Paul uses the word which was used by them on that occasion. The difference in the text is explained by the fact that the term was not in general use and was therefore subject to being changed. The precise name is doubtful, but &quot;the Euraquilo&quot; is more easily explained as a compound of Greek euros, &quot;east wind,&quot; and Latin aquilo, &quot;northeast wind,&quot; hence, euraquilo, &quot;east northeast wind.&quot; This agrees with the experience of navigators in those waters.

On the first day of the week the Christians of Troas had met for an evening service in an upper chamber, and were joined by Paul and his company. As he was to leave in the morning, Paul &quot;prolonged his speech until midnight.&quot; A youth named Eutychus, who was sitting at the open window, became borne down with sleep owing to the lateness of the hour, and ultimately fell through the opening from the third story. He &quot;was taken up dead.&quot; This direct statement is evaded by De Wette and Olshausen, who translate &quot;for dead.&quot; Meyer says this expresses the judgment of those who took him up. However, Luke, the physician, is giving his verdict, and he plainly believes that a miracle was wrought by Paul in restoring a corpse to life. The intention of Luke in relating this incident is to relate a miracle. Paul went down and embraced the youth while comforting the lamenting crowd, &quot;Make ye no ado; for his life is in him.&quot; The interrupted meeting was resumed, the bread was broken, and the conversation continued till break of day. &quot;And they brought the lad alive, and were not a little comforted.&quot;S.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">e-van&#x27;-jel-ist:This is a form of the word ordinarily translated &quot;gospel&quot; (euaggelion), except that here it designates one who announces that gospel to others (euaggelistes, &quot;a bringer of good tidings&quot;), literally, God Himself is an evangelist, for He &quot;preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham&quot; (Ga 3:8); Jesus Christ was an evangelist, for He also &quot;preached the gospel&quot; (Lu 20:1); Paul was an evangelist as well as an apostle (Ro 1:15); Philip the deacon was an evangelist (Ac 21:8); and Timothy, the pastor (2Ti 4:5); and indeed all the early disciples who, on being driven out of Jerusalem, &quot;went everywhere preaching the word&quot; (Ac 8:4 the King James Version).But Eph 4:11 teaches that one particular order of the ministry, distinguished from every other, is singled out by the Head of the church for this work in a distinctive sense. All may possess the gift of an evangelist in a measure, and be obligated to exercise its privilege and duty, but some are specially endued with it. &quot;He gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers.&quot; It will be seen that as an order in the ministry, the evangelist precedes that of the pastor and teacher, a fact which harmonizes with the character of the work each is still recognized as doing. The evangelist has no fixed place of residence, but moves about in different localities, preaching the gospel to those ignorant of it before. As these are converted and united to Jesus Christ by faith, the work of the pastor and teacher begins, to instruct them further in the things of Christ and build them up in the faith.At a later time, the name of &quot;evangelist&quot; was given the writers of the four Gospels because they tell the story of the gospel and because the effect of their promulgation at the beginning was very much like the work of the preaching evangelist. In character, the Gospels bear something of the same relation to the Epistles as evangelists bear to pastors and teachers.James M. Gray</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(Eua; Westcott and Hort, The New Testament in Greek, Heua):&quot;Eve&quot; occurs twice in the New Testament and both references are in the Pauline writings. In 1Ti 2:12-14 woman&#x27;s place in teaching is the subject of discussion, and the writer declares that she is a learner and not a teacher, that she is to be in quietness and not to have dominion over a man. Paul elsewhere expressed this same idea (see 1Co 14:34,35). Having stated his position in regard to woman&#x27;s place, he used the Ge account of the relation of the first woman to man to substantiate his teaching. Paul used this account to illustrate woman&#x27;s inferiority to man, and he undoubtedly accepted it at its face value without any question as to its historicity. He argued that woman is inferior in position, for &quot;Adam was first formed, then Eve.&quot; She is inferior in character, for &quot;Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression.&quot;See CHILD-BEARING.In 2Co 11:3, Paul is urging loyalty to Christ, and he uses the temptation of Eve to illustrate the ease with which one is corrupted. Paul seems to have had no thought but that the account of the serpent&#x27;s beguiling Eve should be taken literally.A. W. Fortune</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ev, (chawwah, &quot;life&quot;; Eua; the name given, as the Scripture writer says, Ge 3:20 (Zoe), from her unique function as &quot;the mother of all living&quot;):The first created woman; created secondarily from Adam (or man) as a &quot;help meet for him&quot; (Ge 2:18-22), and later named and designated as the mother of the human race.For the literary type and object of the story of Eve, see under ADAM, i, 2.1. The Names Given to Her:Two names are given to her, both bestowed by the man, her mate. The first, ishshah, &quot;woman&quot; (literally, &quot;man-ess&quot;), is not strictly a name but a generic designation, referring to her relation to the man; a relation she was created to fulfill in default of any true companionship between man and the beasts, and represented as intimate and sacred beyond that between child and parents (Ge 2:18-24). The second, Eve, or &quot;life,&quot; given after the transgression and its prophesied results, refers to her function and destiny in the spiritual history or evolution of which she is the beginning (Ge 3:16,20). While the names are represented as bestowed by the man, the remarks in Ge 2:24 and 3:20b may be read as the interpretative addition of the writer, suited to the exposition which it is the object of his story to make.2. Her Relation to Man:As mentioned in the article ADAM, the distinction of male and female, which the human species has in common with the animals, is given in the general (or P) account of creation (Ge 1:27); and then, in the more particularized (or J) account of the creation of man, the human being is described at a point before the distinction of sex existed. This second account may have a different origin, but it has also a different object, which does not conflict with but rather supplements the other. It aims to give the spiritual meanings that inhere in man&#x27;s being; and in this the relation of sex plays an elemental part. As spiritually related to the man-nature, the woman-nature is described as derivative, the helper rather than the initiator, yet equal, and supplying perfectly the man&#x27;s social and affectional needs. It is the writer&#x27;s conception of the essential meaning of mating and marriage. To bring out its spiritual values more clearly he takes the pair before they are aware of the species meanings of sex or family, while they are &quot;naked&quot; yet &quot;not ashamed&quot; Ge 2:25, and portrays them purely as companions, individual in traits and tendencies, yet answering to each other. She is the helpmeet for him (ezer keneghdo, &quot;a help answering to him&quot;).3. Her Part in the Change of Condition:True to her nature as the being relatively acted upon rather than acting, she is quicker than the man to respond to the suggestion initiated by the serpent and to follow it out to its desirable results. There is eagerness of desire in her act of taking the fruit quite different from the quasi matter-of-course attitude of the man. To her the venture presents itself wholly from the alluring side, while to him it is more like taking a desperate risk, as he de...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ev-er-last&#x27;-ing (olam, `adh; aidios, aionios):&quot;Everlasting,&quot; in strictness, is that which endures forever; either that which has no beginning and will have no end (in which sense it is applicable to God only), or that which, having a beginning, will have no end, but henceforth will exist forever (thus of beings created for immortality; see IMMORTALITY). Figuratively also the term is applied to objects of impressive stability and long duration, as mountains, hills (eg. Ge 49:26; Hab 3:6).Of the terms indicated as rendered by this word, `olam in the Old Testament and aionios in the New Testament, literally, &quot;age-long,&quot; generally bear the full sense of &quot;eternal&quot; (always as applied to God, His mercy, His covenant, His kingdom and to the eternal life of believers). Hence, in the Revised Version (British and American) the rendering &quot;everlasting&quot; in the King James Version is, in the New Testament, uniformly changed to &quot;eternal&quot; (eg. Mt 18:8; 25:41,46; Lu 16:9; 18:30; Joh 3:16,36, etc.; Ac 13:46; Ro 6:22; 16:26; Ga 6:8; Heb 13:20). In the Old Testament the rendering &quot;everlasting&quot; is usually retained in the Revised Version (British and American), and sometimes takes the place of other words or phrases, as &quot;lasting&quot; (De 33:15), &quot;ever,&quot; &quot;forever&quot; (1Ch 16:36; Ne 9:5), &quot;perpetual&quot; (Hab 3:6; Jer 50:5), &quot;of old&quot; (Hab 3:6 margin). In Ps 100:5; 119:144, on the other hand, the Revised Version (British and American) changes the word to &quot;for ever.&quot; In much the larger number of places `olam is translated &quot;ever&quot; or &quot;for ever.&quot;The word `adh, in the two cases in which it is translated &quot;everlasting&quot; in the King James Version (more frequently &quot;for ever&quot;), is in the Revised Version (British and American), in Isa 9:6, retained, with margin, &quot;Father of Eternity,&quot; and in Hab 3:6 is changed into &quot;eternal.&quot; Another word, qedhem, with the meaning &quot;ancient time,&quot; is rendered &quot;everlasting&quot; in Hab 1:12 (&quot;Art not thou from everlasting?&quot;). With the same meaning it occurs in De 33:27, &quot;The eternal God is thy dwelling-place.&quot;The word which strictly answers to &quot;everlasting&quot; in the New Testament is aidios (Ro 1:20; Jude 1:6), rendered by the King James Version in the former passages &quot;eternal,&quot; but correctly by the Revised Version (British and American) in both passages, &quot;everlasting.&quot; The sense of the word &quot;everlasting,&quot; in application to future punishment, is considered in the article PUNISHMENT, EVERLASTING.The term &quot;everlasting&quot; or &quot;eternal,&quot; applied to God, describes Him as filling, or enduring through, all the &quot;ages&quot; of time. It is only thus that we can symbolically represent eternity. In reality, however, the eternity of God is not simply His filling of ever-flowing &quot;ages,&quot; but rather that aspect of His being in which He is above time; for which time (the succession-form of existence) does not exist; to which the terms past, present and future do not apply. Yet, while God is not in time (rather holds time in Himself), time-sequence, as the form of existence of the world, is a reali...</p>

We choose to discuss the subject under these heads. Many of the evils that come upon men have not been intended by those who suffer for them. Disease, individual and national calamity, drought, scarcity of food, may not always be charged to the account of intentional wrong. Many times the innocent suffer with, and even for, the guilty. In such cases, only physical evil is apparent. Even when the suffering has been occasioned by sin or dereliction of duty, whether the wrong is active or passive, many, perhaps the majority of those who are injured, are not accountable in any way for the ills which come upon them. Neither is God the author of moral evil. &quot;God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempteth no man&quot; (Jas 1:13).See TEMPTATION.1. Moral Evil:By this term we refer to wrongs done to our fellowman, where the actor is responsible for the action. The immorality may be present when the action is not possible. &quot;But if that evil servant shall say in his heart&quot; (Mt 24:48,49), whether he shall smite his fellow-servants or not, the moral evil is present. See SIN. &quot;All these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man&quot; (Mr 7:21-23). The last six commandments of the Decalogue apply here (Ex 20:12-17). To dishonor one&#x27;s parents, to kill, to commit adultery, to steal, to bear false witness and to covet are moral evils. The spiritual import of these commandments will be found in Mt 5:21,22,27,28. &quot;But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness&quot; (Mt 6:23). Words and deeds are coined in the heart before the world sees or hears them (Mt 12:34,35). The word ought or its equal may be found in all languages; hence, it is in the mind of all people as well as in our laws that for the deeds and words we do and speak, we are responsible. &quot;Break off thy sins by righteousness&quot; (Da 4:27) shows that, in God&#x27;s thought, it was man&#x27;s duty, and therefore within his power, to keep the commandment. &quot;Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do well&quot; (Isa 1:16 f). We cannot think of God commanding men to do what He knew they had no ability to do! God has a standing offer of pardon to all men who turn from their evil ways and do that which is right (Eze 33:11-14 f). Evil begins in the least objectionable things. In Ro 1:18-23, we have Paul&#x27;s view of the falling away of the Gentiles. &quot;Knowing God&quot; (verse 21), they were &quot;without excuse&quot; (verse 20), but &quot;glorified him not as God, neither gave thanks; but became vain in their reasonings, and their senseless heart was darkened&quot; (verse 21). &quot;Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools&quot; (verse 22). This led the way into idolatry, and that was followed by all the corruption and wrongdoing to be instigated by a heart turned away from all purity, and practiced in all the iniquity to be suggested by lust without control.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(ra` `ayin, &quot;evil of eye&quot;; ophthalmos poneros):The superstition of the influence of the &quot;evil eye,&quot; so widely spread over the earth, has had a mighty influence on life and language in Palestine, though direct references to it are not frequent in the Scriptures (De 15:9; 28:54,56; Pr 23:6; 28:22; Mt 20:15 (compare Mt 6:23; Lu 11:34); Mr 7:22). In the Bible the expression is synonymous with envy, jealousy and some forms of covetousness. In comparing Ro 1:29 with Mr 7:22 we find that ophthalmos poneros corresponds to phthonos. See Trench, New Testament Synonyms, under the word The eye of the envious (as also the tongue of the invidious by an apparently appreciative word, which, however, only disguises the strong desire of possessing the object of comment or of destroying it for its rightful owner) was supposed to have a baneful influence upon the wellbeing of others, especially of children. Therefore mothers bestowed constant care against the frustration of such fancied designs by means of innumerable sorts of charms. They often allowed their darlings to appear as unlovely as possible, through uncleanliness or rags, so as to spare them the harmful rising of envy in the hearts of others.Lane, Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians, gives perhaps the most accessible account of this superstition as held at the present day in Egypt, and Thomson, The Land and the Book, does the same for Palestine, while an equal amount of evidence might be collected from every other oriental country. Instances of the same superstition, though possibly slightly disguised, are by no means wanting among ourselves. Compare the expression, &quot;green-eyed jealousy&quot; (Othello, III, iii; Merchant of Venice, III, ii), etc.For certain Biblical phrases referring to the &quot;evil eye&quot; see ENVY; EYE.LITERATURE.F.

In the dark picture of fallen men in Ro 1:30, &quot;inventors of evil things&quot; appear. &quot;The evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil (poneros) things&quot; (Mt 12:35). Men should not lust after evil (kakos) things (1Co 10:6). This fixing the mind upon, with desire, leads to increased wrong. &quot;The mouth of the wicked poureth out evil (ra&#x27;) things&quot; (Pr 15:28). The rich man had good things in his life, but did not use them to the glory of God or the good of men. The poor man had evil things: sickness, nakedness, hunger.

Evil- merodach is said in 2Ki 25:27-30 and in the parallel passage in Jer 52:31-34 to have taken Jehoiachin, king of Judah, from his prison in Babylon, where he seems to have been confined for 37 years, to have clothed him with new garments, to have given him a seat above all the other kings, and to have allowed him to eat at the king&#x27;s table all the days of his life. It is an undesigned coincidence, that may be worthy of mention, that the first dated tablet from this reign was written on the 26th of Elul, and Jer 52:31 says that Jehoiachin was freed from prison on the 25th of the same month.R.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ev-o-lu&#x27;-shun:1. The Idea of Evolution:Evolution is a scientific and philosophical theory designed to explain the origin and course of all things in the universe. By origin, however, is not understood the production or emergence of the substance and of the cause or causes of things, but that of the forms in which they appear to the observer. Sometimes the term is vaguely used to cover absolute origin in the sense just excluded. A moment&#x27;s reflection will make it clear that such a view can never secure a place in the realm of pure science. The problem of ultimate origin is not one that science can solve. If it is solved at all, it must be by purely philosophical as distinguished from scientific or scientific-philosophical methods. Evolution, therefore, must be viewed in science purely and strictly as a process of orderly change in the form of things. As such it assumes the existence of substance or substances and of a force or forces working its successive transformations. (NOTE: This position is apparently contradicted in the title of Henri Bergson&#x27;s L&#x27;evolution creatrice. But an examination of Bergson&#x27;s system shows that the contradiction is only apparent. Bergson&#x27;s evolution is neither substance nor efficient cause or principle. The latter is given in his vital impetus (elan vital); the former in his concept of duration.)As an orderly change of the form of things, evolution may be viewed as operative in the field of inorganic matter, or in that of life. In the first, it is known and called cosmic evolution; in the second, organic evolution. Of cosmic evolution again there appear two aspects, according as the process, or law. of transformation, is observed to operate in the realm of the lower units of matter (atoms and molecules), or is studied in the region of the great. In the first sphere, it is made to account for the emergence in Nature of the qualities and powers of different kinds of matter called elements. In the second, it explains the grouping together, the movements and transformations of the solar and of stellar systems. Similarly, of organic evolution there appear to be two varieties. The first occurs in the world of life including the vegetable and animal kingdoms. Evolution here accounts for the various forms of living beings building their bodies and passing from one stage to another in their existence as individuals, and for the course of the history of all life as it differentiates into species and genera. The second variety of evolution operates in the higher realm of intelligence, morality, social activity and religion. The idea of a law of orderly change governing all things is not a new one.Historians of science find it in some form or other embodied in the philosophies of Heraclitus, Democritus, Lucretius and Aristotle. There are those who find it also in the system of Gautama (Buddha).2.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">eks-ko-mu-ni-ka&#x27;-shun:Exclusion from church fellowship as a means of personal discipline, or church purification, or both. Its germs have been found in (1) the Mosaic &quot;ban&quot; or &quot;curse&quot; (cherem, &quot;devoted&quot;), given over entirely to God&#x27;s use or to destruction (Le 27:29); (2) the &quot;cutting off,&quot; usually by death, stoning of certain offenders, breakers of the Sabbath (Ex 31:14) and others (Le 17:4; Ex 30:22-38); (3) the exclusion of the leprous from the camp (Le 13:46; Nu 12:14). At the restoration (Ezr 10:7,8), the penalty of disobedience to Ezra&#x27;s reforming movements was that &quot;all his substance should be forfeited (cherem), and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity.&quot; Nehemiah&#x27;s similar dealing with the husbands of heathen women helped to fix the principle. The New Testament finds a well- developed synagogal system of excommunication, in two, possibly three, varieties or stages. nidduy, for the first offense, forbade the bath, the razor, the convivial table, and restricted social intercourse and the frequenting of the temple. It lasted thirty, sixty, or ninety days. If the offender still remained obstinate, the &quot;curse,&quot; cherem, was formally pronounced upon him by a council of ten, and he was shut out from the intellectual, religious and social life of the community, completely severed from the congregation. shammatha&#x27;, supposed by some to be a third and final stage, is probably a general term applied to both nidduy and cherem. We meet the system in Joh 9:22: &quot;If any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue&quot; (aposunagogos); Joh 12:42: &quot;did not confess .... lest they should be put out of the s.&quot;; and Joh 16:2: &quot;put you out of the synagogue.&quot; In Lu 6:22 Christ may refer to the three stages: &quot;separate you from their company (aphorisosin), and reproach you (oneidisosin = cherem, &quot;malediction&quot;), and cast out your name as evil (ekbalosin).&quot;It is doubtful whether an express prescription of excommunication is found in our Lord&#x27;s words (Mt 18:15-19). The offense and the penalty also seem purely personal: &quot;And if he refuse to hear the church also, let him be unto thee as the Gentile and the publican,&quot; out of the pale of association and converse. Yet the next verse might imply that the church also is to act: &quot;Verily I say unto you, What things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,&quot; etc. But this latter, like Mt 16:19, seems to refer to the general enunciations of principles and policies rather than to specific ecclesiastical enactments. On the whole, Jesus seems here to be laying down the principle of dignified personal avoidance of the obstinate offender, rather than prescribing ecclesiastical action. Still, personal avoidance may logically correspond in proper cases to excommunication by the church. 2Th 3:14: &quot;Note that man, that ye have no company with him&quot;; Tit 3:10: &quot;A factious man .... avoid&quot; (American Revised Version margin); 2 Joh 1:10: &quot;Receive him not into your house,&quot; etc., all inculcate...</p>

In the sense of punishing capitally, by legal process, it is not found. &quot;Executioner&quot; is found only in Mr 6:27 the King James Version, where Herod, the king, is said to have &quot;sent an executioner&quot; (spekoulator) to behead John the Baptist, but the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version have instead, according to the stricter meaning of the text, &quot;The king sent forth a soldier of his guard.&quot; The office of executioner, however, was a recognized office in all the great nations of antiquity.George B.

In the Septuagint of the Old Testament it is used in the sense of &quot;consolation&quot;; but in  /APC 2Macc 7:24, it is translated &quot;exhort,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;appeal.&quot; The verb parakaleo is also translated &quot;exhortation&quot; (1 Macc 13:3 the King James Version) and &quot;exhort&quot; ( /APC 2Macc 9:26).

Colenso&#x27;s Criticism of Large Number 2. Increase of Population 3. Number a Corruption of Original Statement 4. Review==============================================================================I. The Route.1. The Starting-Point:On the 14th Abib (early in April) the Hebrews were gathered at Rameses (Nu 33:5) where apparently the hostile Pharaoh was also living (Ex 12:31). From Ps 78:12,43 it appears that the wonders preceding the Exodus occurred in the &quot;field of Zoan,&quot; where the starting-point may be placed (see RAAMSES; ZOAN). Dr. Naville has suggested that the court was at Bubastis, not at Zoan, and that the route lay from near Zagazig down Wady Tumeilat--a line well fitted for a people driving flocks and herds. On the other hand, in favor of the starting-point having been at Zoan, we read that the &quot;way of the land of the Philistines&quot; was &quot;near&quot; (Ex 13:17). This route, which was not taken lest the people should be discouraged by defeat at Gaza where the Egyptians always had troops, reached Egypt at Migdol (see MIGDOL, 2), and ran thence to Daphnai--some 15 miles--and to Zoan by a second march of the same length. The route from Bubastis to Daphnai (some 50 miles) is less likely to have been described as &quot;near.&quot; Although an Arab will march 30 miles in a day on foot, yet when moving camp with camels, who travel only about 2 miles an hour, with women and children and herds, he only covers about 12 or 15 miles a day. We cannot suppose the Hebrew cattle to have covered more than this distance without water on any single march.2. Rameses to Succoth:We are not told how many days were occupied on the way from Rameses to SUCCOTH (which see), though the general impression is that the stages mentioned (Nu 33) represent a day&#x27;s journey each. Measuring back from the first camp after crossing the Red Sea, we find that Succoth probably lay in the lower part of Wady Tumeilat, where there was plenty of water and herbage. The direct route from Zoan leads to Phakousa (Tell Faqus) by a march of 15 miles through well-watered lands. A second march, across the desert to Heroopolis and down the valley to Succoth, would be of the same length. The Hebrews departed &quot;in haste,&quot; and no doubt made as long ...</p>

In General.1. Name:The second book of the Pentateuch bears in the Septuagint the name of Exodos, in the Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 AD.) accordingly Exodus, on the basis of the chief contents of the first half, dealing with the departure of the children of Israel out of Egypt. The Jews named the book after the first words: we-&#x27;elleh shemoth (&quot;and these are the names&quot;), or sometimes after the first noun shemoth (&quot;names&quot;) a designation already known to Origen in the form of Oualesmoth.2. Contents in General:In seven parts, after the Introduction (Ex 1:1-7), which furnishes the connection of the contents with Genesis, the book treats of(1) the sufferings of Israel in Egypt, for which mere human help is insufficient (Ex 1:8-7:7), while Divine help through human mediatorship is promised;(2) the power of Yahweh, which, after a preparatory miracle, is glorified through the ten plagues inflicted on Pharaoh and which thus forces the exodus (Ex 7:8-13:16);(3) the love of Yahweh for Israel, which exhibits itself in a most brilliant manner, in the guidance of the Israelites to Mt. Sinai, even when the people murmur (Ex 13:17-18:27);(4) making the Covenant at Mt. Sinai together with the revelation of the Ten Words (Ex 20:1 ff) and of the legal ordinances (Ex 21:1 ff) as the condition of making the Covenant (Ex 19:1-24:18);(5) the directions for the building of the Tabernacle, in which Yahweh is to dwell in the midst of His people (Ex 24:18-31:18);(6) the renewal of the Covenant on the basis of new demands after Israel&#x27;s great apostasy in the worship of the Golden Calf, which seemed for the time being to make doubtful the realization of the promises mentioned in (5) above (Ex 32:1-35:3);(7) the building and erection of the Tabernacle of Revelation (or Tent of Meeting) and its dedication by the entrance of Yahweh (Ex 35:4-40:38).As clearly as these seven parts are separated from one another, so clearly again are they most closely connected and constitute a certain progressive whole.In the case of the last four, the separation is almost self-evident. The first three as separate parts are justified by the ten plagues standing between them, which naturally belong together and cause a division between that whic...</p>

Definition:One who expels demons by the use of magical formulas. In the strict etymological sense there is no exorcism in the Bible. The term &quot;exorcists&quot; is used once (Ac 19:13) in a way to discredit the professional exorcists familiarly known both among Jews and Gentiles.2. Method of Expelling Demons in the New Testament:The method of Jesus in dealing with demoniacs was not that of the exorcists. While it is said (Mt 8:16) that He &quot;cast out the spirits with a word,&quot; it is abundantly clear that the word in question was not ritualistic but authoritative. In Lu 4:35 we have a typical sentence uttered by our Lord in the performance of His cures: &quot;Hold thy peace, and come out of him.&quot; In Mr 9:29 we have Christ&#x27;s own emphasis upon the ethical element in dealing with these mysterious maladies: &quot;This kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer.&quot; In Mt 12:28 Jesus gives His own explanation of the method and power used in His cures: &quot;But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.&quot;In Lu 9:1 the terms &quot;authority&quot; and &quot;power&quot; are used in such a way as to show the belief of the evangelists that to cure demon-possession an actual power from God, together with the right to use it, was necessary. This group of passages gives the New Testament philosophy of this dread mystery and its cure. The demons are personal evil powers afflicting human life in their opposition to God. It is beyond man unaided to obtain deliverance from them. It is the function of Christ as the redeemer of mankind to deliver men from this as well as other ills due to sin. Miraculous cures of the same kind as those performed by Christ Himself were accomplished by His disciples in His name (Mr 16:17). The power attributed to &quot;His name&quot; supplies us with the opportunity for a most enlightening comparison and contrast.3. Exorcism in Ethnic and Jewish Writings:Exorcism among ancient and primitive peoples rests largely upon faith in the power of magical formulas, ordinarily compounded of the names of deities and pronounced in connection with exorcistic rites, upon the bodies of the afflicted. The words themselves are supposed to have power over the demons, and the mere recital of the correct list of names is supposed to be efficacious.Attention should be called again to the incantation texts of the Babylonians and Assyrians (see, for translations and full exposition of texts, Rogers, Religion of Babylonia and Assyria, 146 ff). In this direction the absurdities and cruelties of superstition have carried men to extreme lengths. In the case of Josephus we are amazed to see how even in the case of an educated man the most abject superstition controls his views of such subjects. In Ant, VIII, v, in speaking of the wisdom of Solomon, he says that &quot;God enabled him to learn that skill which expels demons, which is a science useful and sanitative to him.&quot; He also describes, in the s...</p>

In Ge 30:27 the King James Version, Laban says, to Jacob, &quot;I have learned by experience (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;divined&quot;) that Yahweh hath blessed me for thy sake.&quot; Here it translates the Hebrew nachash, &quot;to observe diligently,&quot; as when one examines the entrails of a bird or animal for the purpose of divination. In Ec 1:16, the writer says, &quot;I have gotten me great wisdom ....; my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.&quot; Here the Hebrew (ra&#x27;ah) means &quot;hath seen abundantly,&quot; and the idea seems to be that of a wide outlook combined with actual trial of the things discovered or known.In Ro 5:4 the King James Version, the Greek word dokime (the American Standard Revised Version more correctly &quot;approvedness&quot;), means the proof or testing of a thing. We rejoice in tribulation because it works out or produces patience, while the latter develops an experience of God, i.e. it brings out as a proved fact His power and love toward us in our preservation in and deliverance from trial.Thus it is seen the Bible use of the word is not different from the ordinary, which means &quot;the sum of practical wisdom taught by the events and observations of life,&quot; or, to go a little farther, the personal and practical acquaintance with what is so taught. Heb 5:13 gives a good practical example. the King James Version says, &quot;Every one that useth milk is unskillful (apeiros) in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe,&quot; while the Revised Version (British and American) renders &quot;unskilful&quot; by &quot;without experience of.&quot; The thought is that he who fails to search out the deep things of the word of God is so lacking in the exercise of his spiritual senses as to be unable really to know truth from error.James M.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">eks-tor&#x27;-shun:This particular word occurs twice in King James Version: Eze 22:12 (`osheq), and Mt 23:25 (harpage), and indicates that one who is an extortioner is guilty of snatching away from another by strife, greed and oppression that which does not lawfully belong to him. The element of covetousness and usury is involved in the meaning of this word; for it is greedily gotten gain. The publicans were considered as being specially guilty of this sin; this is clear from the Pharisee&#x27;s deprecatory remark: &quot;I am not .... an extortioner ..... as this publican&quot; (Lu 18:11). Paul classes extortion (pleonexia, literally, &quot;over-reaching&quot;) among a category of the grossest crimes known to humanity (1Co 5:10,11); indeed, so grievous is it that it closes the door of heaven in the face of the one guilty of it (1Co 6:10).William Evans</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">i (`ayin; ophthalmos):(1) The physical organ of sight, &quot;the lamp of the body&quot; (Mt 6:22), one of the chief channels of information for man. A cruel custom therefore sanctioned among heathen nations the putting out of the eyes of an enemy or a rival, because thus his power was most effectually shattered (Jud 16:21; 2Ki 25:7; Jer 39:7). Such blinding or putting out of the &quot;right eye&quot; was also considered a deep humiliation, as it robbed the victim of his beauty, and made him unfit to take his part in war (1Sa 11:2; Zec 11:17).The eye, to be useful, was to be &quot;single,&quot; i.e. not giving a double or uncertain vision (Mt 6:22; Lu 11:34). Eyes may grow dim with sorrow and tears (Job 17:7), they may &quot;waste away with griefs&quot; (Ps 6:7; 31:9; 88:9). They may &quot;pour down&quot; (La 3:49), &quot;run down with water&quot; (La 1:16; 3:48). Eyes may &quot;wink&quot; in derision (Ps 35:19; Pr 6:13; 10:10; compare also Pr 16:30; 30:17), and the harlot takes the lustling &quot;with her eyelids&quot; (Pr 6:25). To `lift up the eyes&#x27; (Ge 13:10 et passim) means to look up or around for information and often for help; to `turn away the eye&#x27; or `hide the eyes&#x27; indicates carelessness and lack of sympathy (Pr 28:27); to `cast about the eyes,&#x27; so that they &quot;are in the ends of the earth&quot; (Pr 17:24) is synonymous with the silly curiosity of a fool, and with the lack of attention of him who is everywhere but at his work. In the execution of justice the &quot;eye shall not pity,&quot; i.e. not be deflected from the dictates of the law by favorable or unfavorable impressions (De 19:13 et passim), nor spare (Eze 5:11 et passim), and the lexicon talionis demanded &quot;life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot&quot; (Ex 21:24; De 19:21).(2) Figurative: The eye of the heart or mind, the organ of spiritual perception, which may be enlightened or opened (Ps 119:18). This is done by the law of God (19:8) or by the spirit of God (Eph 1:18), or it may be &quot;darkened&quot; and &quot;holden&quot; (Lu 24:16; compare Mt 13:13; 2Co 4:4).(3) The eye as an index of the mind and disposition of man. The Bible speaks of the &quot;good&quot; margin, or &quot;bountiful&quot; eye, i.e. the kindly, disposition (Pr 22:9); of &quot;proud&quot;, &quot;haughty&quot;, &quot;lofty eyes&quot; (Ps 18:27; 131:1; Pr 6:17); of the &quot;lowly eyes&quot; of the humble (Job 22:29 margin; compare also Lu 18:13); of &quot;adulterous eyes&quot;, &quot;eyes which play the harlot&quot; (Eze 6:9, in the sense of idolatrous inclinations; 2Pe 2:14). Rage or anger is shown by the &quot;sharpening&quot; of the eyes (Job 16:9).(4) The eyes of God, as well as the &quot;seven eyes&quot; of the Lamb (Re 5:6) and the `many eyes&#x27; of the four living creatures of the Apocalypse (Re 4:6; also Eze 1:18; 10:12) are figurative expressions for the omniscience of God (compare Heb 4:13; Ps 139:16) and of His watchfulness and loving care (Jer 32:19). As the human eye may, with the slightest glance or motion, give an indication, a command, so God is able to &quot;guide&quot; or &quot;counsel&quot; His obedient child &quot;with his eye&quot; (Ps 32:8).(5) Three Hebrew expressions are translated by &quot;apple of the ...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">di-zez&#x27;-is:Blindness, defects of sight and diseases of the eye are frequently mentioned in the Scriptures, but usually in general terms. It is probable that in the period covered by the Bible, ophthalmia was as common in Palestine and Egypt as it is now. See BLINDNESS. The commonest of the diseases at present is the purulent conjunctivitis which is a highly infectious malady affecting people of all ages, but especially children, and whose germs are carried from eye to eye by the flies, which are allowed to walk freely over the diseased eyes. This is one of the most disgusting sights in a Palestine village, but I have been told by mothers that it is esteemed unlucky to drive off the flies. In this manner the disease is propagated. The number of persons in any Palestine village whose eyes are more or less blemished by disease is on this account phenomenally large.Blindness incapacitated a man from serving in the priesthood (Le 21:16,18); even a blemish of the eye was regarded as a disqualification (Le 21:20).The cases in the New Testament of persons blind from their birth (as Joh 9:1) were probably the results of this ophthalmia, but may have been due to congenital malformation. The interesting psychological record of the difficulty of interpreting the new visual sensations by the blind man healed by our Lord (Mr 8:22) indicates that it was probably not a case of congenital blindness, as the evangelist uses the word apokatestathe (&quot;restored&quot;), but he had been so long blind that he had lost the power of appreciating the sense-impressions. This condition has been often discussed as a psycho-physical problem since the days of Molyneux and Locke (Essay on the Human Understanding, II, 9, 8).The blindness of Paul was probably a temporary paralysis of the retina from the shock of a dazzling light accentuated by the intense emotion which accompanied his vision on the road to Damascus. The &quot;scales&quot; mentioned in Ac 9:18 were not material, but his sight was restored as if (hosei) scales had fallen from his eyes. How far this left his eyes weak we do not know, but from his inability to recognize the high priest (Ac 23:5) and from his employing an amanuensis for transcribing his epistles (Ro 16:22), as well as from his writing in characters of large size (pelikos; Ga 6:11), it is probable that his vision was defective, and this it has been conjectured was the &quot;thorn in the flesh&quot; of 2Co 12:7.Senile blindness, the result either of cataract or retinal degeneration, is mentioned in the cases of Isaac (Ge 27:1), Jacob (Ge 48:10) and Eli (1Sa 4:15). The frequency of such senile dimness of sight made the case of Moses the more remarkable that at the age of 120 his eye was not dim (De 34:7).Tobit&#x27;s blindness, caused by the irritation of the sparrow&#x27;s dung ( /APC Tobit 2:10), was a traumatic conjunctivitis which left an opacity. It is not said that the whiteness was itself sufficiently large to destroy vision. There was with it probably a considerable amount of conjunc...</p>

The Prophet and His Book.1. The Person of Ezekiel:The name yehezqe&#x27;l, signifies &quot;God strengthens.&quot; The Septuagint employed the form Iezekiel, from which the Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 AD.) took its &quot;Ezechiel&quot; and Luther &quot;Hesekiel.&quot; In Eze 1:3 the prophet is said to be the son of a certain Buzi, and that he was a priest. This combination of the priestly and prophetic offices is not accidental at a time when the priests began to come more and more into the foreground. Thus, too, Jeremiah (1:1) and Zechariah (1:1; compare Ezr 5:1; 6:14; Ne 12:4,16, and my article &quot;Zechariah&quot; in Murray&#x27;s Illustrated Bible Dictionary) were priests and prophets; and in Zec 7:3 a question in reference to fasting is put to both priests and prophets at the same time. And still more than in the case of Zechariah and Jeremiah, the priestly descent makes itself felt in the case of Ezekiel. We here already draw attention to his Levitical tendencies, which appear particularly prominent in Eze 40; Eze 46 (see under II, 2 below), and to the high-priestly character of his picture of the Messiah (21:25 f; 45:22; see II, 3 below).We find Ezekiel in Tel-abib (3:15) at the river Chebar (1:1,3; 3:15) on a Euphrates canal near Nippur, where the American expedition found the archives of a great business house, &quot;Murashu and Sons.&quot; The prophet had been taken into exile in 597 BC. This event so deeply affected the fate of the people and his personal relations that Ezekiel dates his prophecies from this event. They begin with the 5th year of this date, in which year through the appearance of the Divine glory (compare II, 1 below) he had been consecrated to the prophetic office (1:2) and continued to the 27th year (29:17), i.e. from 593 to 571 BC. The book gives us an idea of the external conditions of the exiles. The expressions &quot;pris...</p>

Elath and Ezion-geber were evidently not far apart. They are named together again in connection with the maritime enterprises of Solomon and Jehoshaphat (1Ki 9:26, etc.). They therefore both lay on the shore of the sea. No trace of Ezion-geber is to be found on the present coast line. It is probable, however, that in ancient times the sea covered a considerable stretch of the mud flats at the South end of Wady el-`Arabah, and the site of Ezion-geber may be sought near the spring `Ain el-Ghudyan, about 15 miles North of the present head of the Gulf of `Aqaba.W.

The Greek form is Esdras):(1) A priest who returned with Zerubbabel from Babylon (Ne 12:1). In Ne 10:2, Azariah, the full form of the name, is found.(2) A descendant of Judah and father of Jethro and other sons (1Ch 4:17).(3) The distinguished priest who is the hero of the Book of Ezra and co-worker with Nehemiah.1. Family:The genealogy of Ezra is given in Ezr 7:1-6, where it appears that he was the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, the son of Shallum, the son of Ahitub, the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the high priest. Since Seraiah, according to the Book of Kings, was killed by Nebuchadrezzar at Riblah (2Ki 25:18-21), and since he was the father of Jehozadak, the high priest who was carried into captivity by Nebuchadrezzar (1Ch 6:14,15, Heb 5:14), etc. in 588 BC, and since the return under Ezra took place in 458 BC, the word &quot;son&quot; must be used in Ezr 7:2 in the sense of descendant. Since, moreover, Joshua, or Jeshua, the high priest, who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel, was the son of Jehozadak and the grandson of Seraiah, Ezra was probably the great-grandson or great-great-grandson of Seraiah. Inasmuch as Jehozadak is never mentioned as one of his forefathers, Ezra was probably not descended from Jehozadak, but from a younger brother. He would thus not be a high priest, though he was of high-priestly descent as far as Seraiah. For the sake of shortening the list of names, six names are omitted in Ezr 7:2-7 between Azariah and Meraioth, and one between Shallum and Ahitub from the corresponding list found in 1Ch 6:4-14 (Hebrew 5:30-40).Being a priest by birth, it is to be supposed that Ezra would have performed the ordinary functions of a member of his order, if he had been born and had lived in Palestine.2. Occupation:Jos, indeed, says that he was high priest of his brethren in Babylon, a statement that in view of the revelation of the Elephantine papyri may not be without a foundation in fact. According to the Scriptures and Jewish tradition, however, Ezra was pre-eminently a scribe, and especially a scribe of the law of Moses. He is called &quot;a ready scribe in the law of Moses,&quot; a &quot;scribe of the words of the commandments of Yahweh, and of his statutes to Israel,&quot; &quot;the scribe of the law of the God of heaven.&quot; As early as the time of Jeremiah (compare Jer 8:8), &quot;scribe&quot; had already attained the meaning of one learned in the Scriptures, one who had made the written law a subject of investigation. Ezra is the first who is called by the title of &quot;the scribe,&quot; the title by which Artaxerxes designates him in his letter of instructions in Ezr 7:6,1...</p>

TextLITERATURE===============================================================1. Name:The books of Ezra and Nehemiah, by whomsoever written, are properly so named according to analogy from the principal persons mentioned in them. In the Hebrew Bibles, the former is headed simply, Ezra, and the latter, Nehemiah. The two books are counted in the Talmud, in Josephus, and in the Canon of Melito, 171 AD, as one, and are so treated also in the subscription of the Massoretic Text, which reads: &quot;The totality of the verses of Ezra and Nehemiah is 688, and its sign is `Remember, Yahweh, the reproach of thy servants,&#x27; and its two parts (are at the sentence) `unto the ascent of the corner&#x27; (Ne 3:31) and its chapters (sedharayw) are ten, and its sign is `Upon a high mountain get thee up, O thou that announcest good tidings to Zion.&#x27; &quot; In the Septuagint, Ezra-Nehemiah is called Esdras B, while an apocryphal Book of Ezra is called Esdras A (see below). In the catalogues of the Old Testament writings handed down to us by the Fathers (Origen, Cyril, Melito, Jerome and the Council of Laodicea) our Ezra is called 1 Ezra; Nehemiah, 2 Ezra; the apocryphal Greek Ezra, 3 Ezra; and an apocalyptic book, falsely called a book of Ezra, is denominated 4 Ezra.2. Object:The object of the books is to show that God fulfilled His promise, or prophecy, to restore His exiled people to their inheritance, through the instrumentality on the one hand of the great heathen monarchs, Cyrus, Darius and Artaxerxes, and on the other hand by stirring up the spirit of such great men among the chosen people as Joshua and Zerubbabel, Haggai and Zechariah, and Ezra and Nehemiah, through whom the altar, the temple, the houses and walls of Jerusalem, and finally the worship and ceremony of the Jewish people were reestablished, the people being separated from foreign admixtures, customs and idolatry, and their religious observances purified and fixed for all time.3. Plan:The object of the work justifies the selection and arrangement of the material and the plan pursued by the composer, or composers; all matter being stringently excluded which does not bear directly upon the purpose in view. However much we may wish that other historical records had been included, it is not proper to criticize the work because of these omissions, nor is it fair to argue that the writer was ignorant of what he has not seen fit to record.4. Unity:The unity of the combined work is shown by the fact that they have the same common object, the same plan, and a similarity of language and style; that they treat, for the most part, of the same period of time; and that Ezra is one of the most prominent persons in both. It is not fair to deny the essential unity on the ground that the list of priests and others found in Ezr 2 is repeated in Ne 7; for there is no doubt that Ezra was the compiler of parts at least of the bo...</p>
