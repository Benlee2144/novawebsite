In Jehoram&#x27;s invasion of Moab it alone withstood his attack; and on the city wall the king of Moab sacrificed his son (2Ki 3:25). It was obviously the capital, i.e. Kir Moab. The name is generally taken to mean &quot;city of the sun.&quot; Cheyne, however, points out (EB, under the word):(1) that this explanation was unknown to the ancients;(2) that&quot;kir&quot; is nowhere suposed to mean &quot;city,&quot; except in the compound names Kir-heres, Kir-hareseth, and Kir Moab;(3) that cheres, &quot;sun,&quot; nowhere has a feminine ending, and(4) that Isa 16:7 Septuagint and Aquila.) indicates &quot;d&quot; and not &quot;r&quot; in the second part of the name (Deseth).

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kwal (selaw; ortugometra; Latin Coturnix vulgaris): A game bird of the family Coturnix, closely related to &quot;partridges&quot; (which see). Quail and partridges are near relatives, the partridge a little larger and of brighter color. Quail are like the gray, brown and tan of earth. Their plumage is cut and penciled by markings, and their flesh juicy and delicate food. Their habits are very similar. They nest on the ground and brood on from 12 to 20 eggs. The quail are more friendly birds and live in the open, brooding along roads and around fields. They have a longer, fuller wing than the partridge and can make stronger flight. In Palestine they were migratory. They are first mentioned in Ex 16:13: &quot;And it came to pass at even, that the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the camp.&quot; This describes a large flock in migration, so that they passed as a cloud. Nu 11:31-33: &quot;And there went forth a wind from Yahweh, and brought quail from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day&#x27;s journey on this side, and a day&#x27;s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth. And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quail: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp&quot;; compare Ps 78:26-30:&quot;He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens;And by his power he guided the south wind.He rained flesh also upon them as the dust,And winged birds as the sand of the seas:And he let it fall in the midst of their camp,Round about their habitations.So they did eat, and were well filled;And he gave them their own desire.&quot;Again the birds are mentioned in migration. Those that fell around the camp and the bread that was sent from heaven are described in Ps 105:39-42. Commentators have had trouble with the above references. They cause the natural historian none--they are so in keeping with the location and the laws of Nature. First the Hebrew selaw means &quot;to be fat.&quot; That would be precisely the condition of the quail after a winter of feeding in the South. The time was early spring, our April, and the quail were flocking from Africa and spreading in clouds--even to Europe. They were birds of earth, heavy feeders and of plump, full body. Migration was such an effort that when forced to cross a large body of water they always waited until the wind blew in the direction of their course, lest they tire and fall. Their average was about 16 birds to each nest. If half a brood escaped, they yet multiplied in such numbers as easily to form clouds in migration. Pliny writes of their coming into Italy in such numbers, and so exhausted with their long flight, that if they sighted a sailing vessel they settled upon it by hundreds and in such numbers as to sink it. Taking into consideration the diminutive vessels of that age and the myriads of birds, this does not appear incredible...</p>

The quarryman seeks a thick stratum of firm limestone which has a favorable exposure. The vertical joint-planes divide the stratum into large blocks which the quarryman dislodges with the aid of crowbars. These great blocks he skillfully cleaves by inserting several wedges in a line in holes made by a pick, and driving the wedges in with a heavy hammer. In these days gunpowder is occasionally used, especially when there are not favorable joint-planes producing blocks capable of being moved by the crowbar.Another method, which is employed where stones of great size are wanted, is to carve the stones out of the rock by cutting channels around them with the pick. In the limestone quarries of Ba`albek and the granite quarries of Acwan at the first cataract of the Nile, enormous stones may be seen which were abandoned while in process of being removed by this method. The channels are wide enough to admit the body of the workman, and the marks of the picks on the sides of the channels are plainly visible.Alfred Ely Day</p>

To four such companies Peter had been handed over, who would take their turn of acting as guard over the prisoner, each of the four watches of the night according to Roman reckoning, which Herod Agrippa I would follow. In the castle of Antonia Peter was thus closely secured, in order that Herod, who had already killed James, the brother of John, with the sword (Ac 12:2), might, after the solemnities of the Passover, make sure of his death likewise. On the night before his intended execution he was sleeping in his cell between two soldiers, &quot;bound with two chains,&quot; his left hand chained to one and his right to the other. The other two soldiers of the quaternion mounted guard before the door, and are spoken of as &quot;the first and the second guard&quot; (Ac 12:10) whom Peter and his angel guide had to pass on the way to liberty. The Greek word thus rendered is not found in the Septuagint or anywhere else in the New Testament.T. Nicol.</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kwen: The Bible applies this term:(1) To the wife of a king (&quot;queen consort&quot;) (malkah). In the Book of Esther it is the title given to Vashti (1:9) and Esther (2:22); compare So 6:8 f. Another Hebrew word for queen consort is gebhirah, literally &quot;mistress&quot; (compare 1Ki 11:19, the wife of Pharaoh; 2Ki 10:13, &quot;the children of the king and the children of the queen&quot;). In Ne 2:6 and Ps 45:9 we find the expression sheghal, which some trace back to shaghal, &quot;to ravish,&quot; a rather doubtful derivation. Still another term is sarah, literally, &quot;princess&quot; (Isa 49:23). The Septuagint sometimes uses the word basilissa; compare Ps 45:9.(2) To a female ruler or sovereign (&quot;queen regnant&quot;). The only instances are those of the queen (malkah) of Sheba (1Ki 10:1-13; compare 2Ch 9:1-12) and of Candace, the queen (basilissa) of the Ethiopians (Ac 8:27). In Mt 12:42 (compare Lu 11:31) Christ refers to the queen of the south (basilissa notou), meaning, of course, the queen of Sheba.(3) To a heathen deity, melekheth ha-shamayim, &quot;the queen of heaven&quot; (Jer 7:18; 44:17).See QUEEN OF HEAVEN.(4) Metaphorically, to the city of Babylon (Rome) (Re 18:7): an expression denoting sovereign contempt and imaginary dignity and power.William Baur</p>

          <h3 style="font-family:var(--font-heading);color:var(--leather-dark);margin:0 0 0.5rem;">QUEEN MOTHER</h3>
          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(gebhirah, literally, &quot;mistress,&quot; then a female ruler, and sometimes simply the wife of a king (&quot;queen,&quot; 1Ki 11:19); in Da 5:10 the term malketha&#x27; &quot;queen,&quot; really means the mother of the king): It stands to reason that among a people whose rulers are polygamists the mother of the new king or chief at once becomes a person of great consequence. The records of the Books of Kings prove it. The gebhirah, or queen mother, occupied a position of high social and political importance; she took rank almost with the king. When Bath-sheba, the mother of Solomon, desired &quot;to speak unto him for Adonijah,&quot; her son &quot;rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king&#x27;s mother; and she sat on his right hand&quot; (1Ki 2:19). And again, in 2Ki 24:15, it is expressly stated that Nebuchadnezzar carried away the king&#x27;s mother into captivity; Jeremiah calls her gebhirah (29:2). The king was Jehoiachin (Jeconiah, Jer 29:2), and his mother&#x27;s name was Nehushta (2Ki 24:8). This was the royal pair whose impending doom the prophet was told to forecast (Jer 13:18). Here again the queen mother is mentioned with the king, thus emphasizing her exalted position. Now we understand why Asa removed Maacah his (grand?)mother from being queen (queen mother), as we are told in 1Ki 15:13 (compare 2Ch 15:16). She had used her powerful influence to further the cause of idolatry. In this connection Athaliah&#x27;s coup d&#x27;etat may be briefly mentioned. After the violent death of her son Ahaziah (2Ki 9:27), she usurped the royal power and reigned for some time in her own name (2Ki 11:3; compare 2Ch 22:12). This was, of course, a revolutionary undertaking, being a radical departure from the usual traditions.And finally, the political importance of the gebhirah is illustrated by the fact that in the Books of Kings, with two exceptions, the names of the Jewish kings are recorded together with those of their respective mothers; they are as follows: Naamah, the Ammonitess, the mother of Rehoboam (1Ki 14:21; compare 14:31, and 2Ch 12:13); Maacah, the daughter of Abishalom (1Ki 15:2) or Absalom (2Ch 11:20) the mother of Abijah; Maacah, the daughter of Abishalom, the mother (grandmother?) of Asa (1Ki 15:10; compare 2Ch 15:16); Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi, the mother of Jehoshaphat (1Ki 22:42; compare 2Ch 20:31); Athaliah, the grand-daughter of Omri, the mother of Ahaziah (2Ki 8:26; compare 2Ch 22:2); Zibiah of Beersheba, the mother of Jehoash (2Ki 12:1; compare 2Ch 24:1); Jehoaddin (Jehoaddan, 2Ch 25:1) of Jerusalem, the mother of Amaziah (2Ki 14:2); Jecoliah (Jechiliah, 2Ch 26:3) of Jerusalem, the mother of Azariah (2Ki 15:2) or Uzziah (2Ki 15:13,30, etc.; compare 2Ch 26:3); Jerusha (Jerushah, 2Ch 27:1), the daughter of Zadok, the mother of Jotham (2Ki 15:33); Abi (Abijah, 2Ch 29:1), the daughter of Zechariah, the mother of Hezekiah (2Ki 18:2); Hephzibah, the mother of Manasseh (2Ki 21:1); Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah, ...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(melekheth ha-shamayim, although there is another reading, mele&#x27;kheth, &quot;worship&quot; or &quot;goddess&quot;): Occurs only in two passages: Jer 7:18; 44:17-19,25, where the prophet denounces the wrath of God upon the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem who have given themselves up to the worship of the host of heaven. This is no doubt a part of the astral worship which is found largely developed among the Jews in the later period of their history in Canaan. It is first mentioned in 2Ki 17:16 as practiced by the men of the Northern Kingdom when Samaria had fallen and the ten tribes were being carried away into captivity. Moses is represented as warning the Israelites against the worship of the sun and moon and stars and all the host of heaven, practiced by the people of Canaan (De 4:19; 17:3) and the existence of such worship among the Canaanites and neighboring nations is attested from an early period (compare Job 31:26-28). The worship of the heavenly bodies was widely spread in the East and in Arabia; and the Babylonian pantheon was full of astral deities, where each divinity corresponded either to an astral phenomenon or to some circumstance or occurrence in Nature which is connected with the course of the stars (Jeremias, The Old Testament in the Light of the Ancient East, I, 100). From the prophets we gather that before the exile the worship of the host of heaven had become established among all classes and in all the towns of Israel (Jer ubi supra; Eze 8:16). In that worship the queen of heaven had a conspicuous place; and if, as seems probable from the cakes which were offered, she is to be identified with the Assyrian Ishtar and the Canaanite Astarte, the worship itself was of a grossly immoral and debasing character. That this Ishtar cult was of great antiquity and widely spread in ancient Babylonia may be seen from the symbols of it found in recent excavations (see Nippur, II, 236). How far the astral theorists like Winckler and Jeremias are entitled to link up with this worship the mourning for Josiah, the lamentations over Tammuz, the story of Jephthah&#x27;s daughter, and even--the narrative of the misfortunes and the exaltation of Joseph, is questionable. But that the people of Judah in the days before the exile had given themselves over to the worst and vilest forms of heathen worship and incurred the grievous displeasure of Yahweh is made clear by the denunciation of the worship of the queen of heaven by Jeremiah.T.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">she&#x27;-ba (1Ki 10:1-13; 2Ch 9:1-12, called in Mt 12:42; Lu 11:31, &quot;the queen of the south&quot; (basilissa notou)):1. Old Testament Accounts:The two Old Testament accounts of the coming of the queen of Sheba (see SHEBA) to Solomon differ slightly from one another, and, of the two, that in 1 Kings is the older. (1) The words &quot;concerning the name of Yahweh&quot; (1Ki 10:1) are lacking in 2 Chronicles; while the Septuagint in 1 Kings has &quot;and the name of Yahweh,&quot; apparently a correction of the Massoretic Text. (2) For 1Ki 10:9, &quot;because Yahweh loved Israel for ever,&quot; 2Ch 9:8 has &quot;because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever&quot;; the Septuagint in 1 Kings has &quot;because Yahweh loved Israel, to establish it forever.&quot; (3) In the last verse of each account we find another difference: 2Ch 9:12 says that Solomon gave to the queen all her desire, &quot;besides that which she had brought unto the king.&quot; i.e. according to some, besides the equivalent of what she had brought to him; 1Ki 10:13 margin has&quot; besides that which he gave her according to the hand of king Solomon,&quot; i.e. besides gifts commensurate with his own wealth and power (SBOT), or be sides gifts which he gave her qua king.2. The Narrative:The narrative tells of the queen of Sheba, on hearing of Solomon&#x27;s great wisdom, coming to test him with perplexing questions or riddles (compare Jud 14:12). She brought presents to the king, and interviewed him: &quot;And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built&quot; (i.e. the palace, not the temple) as well as its arrangements, &quot;and his burnt-offering which he offered in the house of Yahweh (so read and translate with the Revised Version margin in 1Ki 10:5, and also in 2Ch 9:4); there was no more spirit in her&quot;: the half of Solomon&#x27;s wisdom had not been told her. &quot;Happy,&quot; she said to him, &quot;are thy wives (so read with Septuagint, Syriac and Old Latin versions), happy are these thy servants.&quot; She then exchanged gifts with him and returned to her own land.The narrative is a complement of that in 1Ki 3:16-28, where the king&#x27;s justice is exemplified; here his wisdom.3. Employed by Jesus:The narrative is referred to by Jesus in Mt 12:42; Lu 11:31, where He refuses to accede to the request of the scribes and Pharisees for a sign from Him. He tells them that no sign will be given them except that of Jonah, whose sign was his preaching, one that proved sufficient to the Ninevites; and `behold something greater than Jonah is here.&#x27; The men of Nineveh will be a living condemnation of them &quot;in the judgment&quot; (compare Lu 16:31); and so will the &quot;queen of the south&quot; who came from the ends of the earth after hearing of Solomon&#x27;s wisdom, `and behold something greater than Solomon is here.&#x27; The only sign to be given is that of the wisdom of Jesus, a wisdom far greater than that of Solomon (see D. Smith, Days of His Flesh, 176 ff).4. Eastern Literature:Eastern literature has much to say about the queen of Sheba. The Arabs called her Bilqis. Abys...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kwench, kwensh: Where the word is used of fire or of thirst it has the usual meaning: &quot;to allay,&quot; &quot;to extinguish,&quot; &quot;to suppress,&quot; &quot;to cool.&quot; In the Old Testament it is frequently applied to the affections and passions (see 2Ki 22:17; So 8:7; Isa 42:3; Jer 4:4; 21:12). Quenching the coal or the light of Israel may mean slaying a dear one or a brilliant leader. In the New Testament it is also used figuratively, as in Eph 6:16 the shield of faith quenches the fiery darts of the evil one. In Mr 9:48, sbennumi, and its derivative are applied with reference to Gehenna (translated &quot;hell&quot;). The same word is also used of resisting the gifts of the Holy Spirit in 1Th 5:19.G. H.

In the New Testament for zetema, the synonym zetesis (and 1Ti 1:4, ekzetesis), being rendered &quot;questionings&quot; by the Revised Version (British and American) (the King James Version does not distinguish). In Mr 11:29 for logos, &quot;word&quot; (so the Revised Version margin). The verb in the sense &quot;ask a question&quot; in 2Ch 31:9 for darash, and Lu 2:46; 23:9 for eperotao (compare the American Standard Revised Version, the English Revised Version margin Joh 16:23). Elsewhere the verb is for suzeteo, &quot;dispute&quot; (Mr 1:27, etc.; compare Ac 6:9; 9:29). &quot;Called in question,&quot; Ac 19:40 the King James Version, represents egkaleo, &quot;call into court,&quot; but in Ac 23:6; 24:21, &quot;I am called in question&quot; is for krinomai, &quot;I am being judged.&quot;Burton Scott Easton</p>

As the translation of ruach (Isa 11:3) &quot;quick&quot; as found in the King James Version signified &quot;acute.&quot; In this passage the Revised Version (British and American) substitutes &quot;delight&quot; for &quot;quick understanding.&quot; In Le 13:10,24 the Revised Version (British and American) retains the rendering &quot;quick,&quot; although originally the word michyah must in some way have involved the conception of life, which no longer belongs to the English word &quot;quick.&quot; It is not clear exactly in what sense the flesh in the sore or scar was thought of as living, especially as it was plainly regarded as in an unhealthy condition. Possibly the condition under consideration resembled what is sometimes idiomatically styled in English &quot;proud flesh,&quot; and was thought of as a peculiar manifestation of life.To quicken also means a reviving, a refreshing, an increasing of life (Ps 71:20; 85:6; 119:37,40,88; Isa 57:10). It often has reference to the resurrection from the dead (1Co 15:36) and is so used in many places in the King James Version. Where it refers to the giving of spiritual life the American Standard Revised Version has changed it in every case (Eph 2:1,5; Col 2:13; compare Joh 5:21).David Foster Estes</p>

Introductory.Limitation of the Discussion:There are, all told, approximately 300 direct quotations from the Old Testament in the New Testament. The presence of so many citations, each of one of which involves an interpretation of the passage given a new context in quotation, opens many avenues of discussion and propounds many difficult and far-reaching problems. In every separate instance, in the long list of New Testament quotations, the principle of accommodation (see ACCOMMODATION) in some form is involved and, consequently, the question of historical and exegetical accuracy is unavoidably raised. In the present article we shall concentrate attention upon that which is of far greater importance than the question whether the writer is incidentally correct, according to modern scientific principles, in any specific citation. This more important and vital issue we take to be the general, guiding principles adopted by the New Testament writers in their use of the book of the older covenant. A review of these principles, together with certain outstanding and typical instances in which these principles are used and applied, will form the substance of the discussion.II. Constructive Principles of New Testament Quotation.1. Unity of the Two Dispensations:In the first place, the New Testament writers regard the Christian religion as having its roots in the Old Testament. From the call of Abraham to the founding and expansion of the Christian church the men of the New Testament recognize a single organic movement. In their use of the ancient oracles in new setting they constantly and confidently rely upon the unity of the two dispensations, that recorded in the Old Testament and that in which they themselves were participants. Such a unity, taking for granted its existence, would remove to a degree the very distinction implied in the terms Old and New Testaments, and would involve a definite and organic relationship of all the books to each other. There are no longer two separate groups of books standing apart from each other and having bonds of union only within the group, but, on the contrary, two related sub-groups outwardly corresponding to contrasted phases of the historical movement, but inwardly conformed to the deep-lying principles which make the entire movement one. According to this idea the Book of Genesis is as really related to the Gospel of Matthew as it is to the Book of Exodus. On the surface, and hist...</p>
