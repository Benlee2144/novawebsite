They give us most interesting information in regard to the progress made in the propagation of the gospel in Rome.It is necessary to ask, in the first place, What is meant by the words &quot;Caesar&#x27;s household&quot;? and when the meaning of that phrase is known, then it is needful to discuss the question which rises at once, In what way did the gospel enter Caesar&#x27;s household? How is it that the gospel, which at the first chiefly advanced among the poorer classes in the Empire, made its way at a bound into the very palace of the Caesars?1. What Exactly Was Caesar&#x27;s Household?:&quot;Caesar&#x27;s household&quot; meant the whole of the persons, slaves and freemen alike, composing the establishment of the emperor in his palace on the Palatine Hill at Rome. The slaves of the imperial household formed a host in themselves. At a time when many a private citizen in Rome owned several hundreds of slaves, it need not surprise anyone to know that there was a vastly larger number of such persons in the palace of the emperor. This was a period when the city of Rome and the court of the Caesars swarmed with Asiatics, many of whom were Jews, and many of them would be in slavery, or in employment, in the imperial court. It cannot be forgotten that Poppea, Nero&#x27;s shameless consort, was a proselyte to Judaism and that she continued to advocate successfully the cause of the Jews before the emperor as occasion arose.These persons in the emperor&#x27;s palace would be employed in every conceivable capacity as household servants, cooks, bathmen, gardeners, grooms, kennel-keepers, porters, doorkeepers, messengers, secretaries, amanuenses, teachers, librarians, architects, carpenters, shoemakers, and in all other forms of service. Of course they were not all slaves: there was a very large number of freemen. The domus or familia Caesaris (represented by the Greek oikia Kaisaros) included the whole of the imperial household, the meanest slaves as well as the most powerful courtiers. On the character and constitution of this household we happen to possess more information than perhaps on any other department of social life in Rome. &quot;In Rome itself, if we may judge by these inscriptions, the domus Augusta must have formed no inconsiderable fraction of the whole population; but it comprised likewise all persons in the emperor&#x27;s service, whether slaves or freemen, in Italy and even in the provinces&quot; (Lightfoot, Commentary on Phil, 171). In the list of offices filled by members of the imperial household were also such functions as those of keepers of the wardrobe or of the plate-chest; even the &quot;tasters&quot; formed a separate class of servants under a chief of their own. To belong to Caesar&#x27;s household would secure even to the lowest grade of slaves substantial...</p>

It was built by Herod the Great on the site of Strato&#x27;s Tower (Ant., XIII, xi, 2; XV, ix, 6), and the name Caesarea Sebaste was given it in honor of Augustus (ibid., XVI, v, 1). With his usual magnificence Herod lavished adornments on the city. He erected sumptuous palaces and public buildings, a theater, and amphitheater with prospect to the sea; while a spacious system of sewers under the city secured cleanliness and health. But &quot;the greatest and most laborious work of all&quot; was a magnificent harbor &quot;always free from the waves of the sea,&quot; which Josephus says was not less than the Piraeus: this however is an exaggeration. It was of excellent workmanship, and all the more remarkable because the place itself was not suitable for such noble structures. The whole coast line, indeed, is singularly ill-fitted for the formation of harbors. The mighty breakwater was constructed by letting down stones 50 x 18 x 9 ft. in size into twenty fathoms deep. The mole was 200 ft. wide. Part was surmounted by a wall and towers. A promenade and dwellings for mariners were also provided. The work was done in ten or twelve years. It became the residence of the Roman procurator. It passed into the hands of Agrippa I; and here he miserably died (Ac 12:19,23). Here dwelt Philip the Evangelist (Ac 8:40; 21:8). To Caesarea Peter was sent to minister to the Roman centurion Cornelius (Ac 10). Thrice Paul passed through Caesarea (Ac 9:30; 18:22; 21:8); hither he was sent under guard from Jerusalem to escape danger from the Jews (Ac 23:23); and here he was imprisoned till his final departure for Rome.Riots between Gentiles and Jews in Caesarea gave rise to the war (BJ, II, xiii, 7;. xiv, 4 f). Terrible cruelties were practiced on the Jews under Felix and Florus. Here Vespasian was hailed emperor by his soldiers. Titus here celebrated the birthday of his brother Domitian by setting 2,500 Jews to fight with beasts in the amphitheater. Eusebius was bishop of Caesarea (313-40 AD). In 548 AD a massacre of the Christians was organized and carried out by the Jews and Samaritans. The city passed into Moslem hands in 638. In the time of the Crusades it fell, now to the Christians and now to the Moslems; and was finally overthrown by Sultan Bibars in 1265 AD.The cathedral stood on the site of a temple built by Herod, where the ruins are seen today; as are also those of two aqueducts which conveyed water from Nahr ez-Zerqa. The landward wall of the Roman city was nearly 3 miles in length.(2) Caesarea Philippi (fi-lip&#x27;-i) (Kaisareia he Philippou).At the Southwest base of Mt. Hermon, on a rocky terrace, 1,150 ft. above sea-level, between Wady Khashabeh and Wady Za`areh, lie the ruins of the ancient city. It was a center for the worship of Pan: whence the name Paneas, applied not only to the city...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kaj (kelubh; phulake): The earliest known form of cage made to confine a bird, for the pleasure of its song or the beauty of its coloring, was a crude affair of willows or other pliable twigs. Later cages were made of pottery, and now they are mostly made of wire. References in the Bible make it very clear that people were accustomed to confine in cages such birds as they especially prized for pets, or to detain them for market purposes. James indicated that cages were common when he wrote (Jam 3:7): &quot;For every kind of beasts and birds .... is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind.&quot; In Job (Job 41:5) we find these lines  &quot;Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?&quot;  The only way to play with a bird is to confine it so that it grows accustomed to you and thus loses fear. Jeremiah compared the civil state of Judah to a &quot;cage (crate) full of birds&quot; (Jer 5:27), &quot;the houses of the rich being stuffed with craftily-obtained wealth and articles of luxury&quot; (HDB). The sale of sparrows as an article of food still continues in the eastern markets. Jesus referred to this (Mt 10:29) and it was He who entered the temple and overthrew &quot;the seats of them that sold the doves&quot; (Mt 21:12). In Re 18:2 we find a reference to &quot;a hold (the King James Version &quot;cage&quot;) of every unclean and hateful bird.&quot; See also Ecclesiasticus 11:30.Gene Stratton-Porter</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ka&#x27;-a-fas, ki&#x27;-a-fas (Kaiaphas; Caiaphas = Kephas (compare Dods in Expositor&#x27;s Greek Test, I, 803), and has also been interpreted as meaning &quot;depression&quot;): Caiaphas was the surname of Joseph, a son-in-law of Annas (compare Joh 18:13), who filled th e post of high priest from about 18-36 AD, when he was deposed by Vitellius (compare Josephus, Ant, XVIII, ii, 2; iv, 3). He is mentioned by Luke as holding office at the time of John the Baptist&#x27;s preaching in the wilderness (Lu 3:2).Caiaphas took a leading part in the trial and condemnation of Jesus. It was in his court or palace that the chief priests (Sadducees) and Pharisees, who together constituted the Sanhedrin, assembled &quot;that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him&quot; (compare Mt 26:3,4; Joh 11:49). The regal claims of the new Messiah and the growing fame of His works had made them to dread both the vengeance of imperial Rome upon their nation, and the loss of their own personal authority and prestige (compare Joh 11:48). But Caiaphas pointed a way out of their dilemma: let them bide their time till the momentary enthusiasm of the populace was spent (compare Mt 26:5), and then by the single sacrifice of Jesus they could at once get rid of a dangerous rival and propitiate the frowns of Rome (compare Joh 11:49,50; 18:14). The commentary of John upon this (Joh 11:51,52) indicates how the death of Jesus was indeed to prove a blessing not only for Israel but also for all the children of God; but not in the manner which the cold-blooded statecraft of Caiaphas intended. The advice of the high priest was accepted by the Sanhedrin (Joh 11:53), and they succeeded in arresting Jesus. After being led &quot;to Annas first&quot; (Joh 18:13), Jesus was conducted thence in bonds to Caiaphas (Joh 18:24), According to Mt He was led immediately upon His arrest to Caiaphas (Mt 26:57). Mr and Lu do not refer to Caiaphas by name. His conduct at this preliminary trial of Jesus (Mt 26:57-68), its time and its procedure, were almost entirely illegal from the standpoint of then existing Jewish law (compare JESUS CHRIST, THE ARREST AND TRIAL OF; and A. Taylor Innes, The Trial of Jesus Christ). False witnesses were first called, and when Jesus refused to reply to their charges, Caiaphas asked of Him if He were &quot;the Christ, the Son of God &quot; (Mt 26:63). Upon our Lord&#x27;s answering &quot;Thou hast said&quot; (Mt 26:64), Caiaphas &quot;rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy&quot; (Mt 26:65). Upon this charge was Jesus found &quot;worthy of death&quot; (Mt 26:66). Caiaphas is also mentioned in Ac 4:6 as being among those who presided over the trial of Peter and John.C. M. Kerr</p>

The Scripture Narrative:(1) In Ge 4:1-24 Cain is the first son of Adam and Eve. His birth is hailed as a manifestation of Yahweh&#x27;s help. He becomes &quot;a tiller of the ground,&quot; and brings to Yahweh an offering of the produce of the soil, his brother Abel, the shepherd, bringing at the same time the fat of the first-born of his own flock. From Cain and from his offering Yahweh withholds the sign of acceptance which he grants to Abel. That the ground of this difference of treatment is to be found (so Heb 11:4) in Cain&#x27;s lack of right disposition toward Yahweh is shown by his behavior (see ABEL). Instead of humbling himself he gives signs of strong indignation at Yahweh&#x27;s refusal to favor him. Under the just rebuke of Yahweh he hardens his heart and is further confirmed in impenitence. His jealousy of Abel, unrepented of, increases until it culminates in deliberate murder. Deliberate, for in Ge 4:8 we must restore a clause to the Hebrew text, all the ancient versions bearing witness, and read &quot;And Cain said unto Abel his brother, Let us go into the field,&quot; etc. In the vain attempt to conceal his crime Cain adds falsehood to his other sins. He is cursed &quot;from,&quot; i.e. away from, that soil upon which he poured out his brother&#x27;s blood, and must become a fugitive and a wanderer, far from the immediate presence of Yahweh. Although his remonstrance against the severity of his sentence displays no genuine contrition, still Yahweh in pity appoints a &quot;sign&quot; for his protection. Cain takes up his abode in the land of Nod (&quot;wandering&quot;), and there builds a city and becomes the ancestor of a line which includes Jabal, forefather of tent-dwelling cattle-keepers; Jubal, forefather of musicians; Tubal-cain, forefather of smiths; and Lamech, like Cain, a man of violence. In Cain&#x27;s character we see &quot;a terrible outburst of selfwill, pride, and jealousy, leading to a total and relentless renunciation of all human ties and affection.&quot; &quot;Among the lessons or truths which the narrative teaches may be instanced: the nature of temptation, and the manner in which it should be resisted; the consequences to which an unsubdued temper may lead a man; the gradual steps by which in the end a deadly crime may be committed; the need of sincerity of purpose lest our offering should be rejected; God&#x27;s care for the guilty sinner after he has been punished; the interdependence upon one another of members of the human race; and the duties and obligations which we all owe to each other&quot; (Driver). In Heb 11:4 Cain&#x27;s spiritual deficiency is pointed out; 1Jo 3:12 observes his envy and jealousy, as &quot;of the wicked one,&quot; and Jude 1:11 makes him a very type of the ungodly.2. Difficulties:With few and bold strokes the story of Cain as it stands paints for us the character of the first of murderers and the scene of his de...</p>

The meaning of the name is unknown, but if a Sumerian etymology be accepted, some such signification as &quot;Holy Gate&quot; (Ka-lah) or the like--a parallel to Ka-dingira = Bab-ili, &quot;Gate of God&quot; (see BABEL, BABYLON)--might be regarded as possible.1. Date of the City&#x27;s Foundation:As Nineveh is mentioned by Hammurabi, who reigned about 2000 BC, it is clear that that city was already, in his time, an important place; and the passage in Ge 10:11 implies, though it does not actually prove, that Calah was of about the same period.2. Early References to the City:The Assyrian king Assur-nacir-apli (circa 885 BC) states that Calah was made (probably = founded) by Shalmaneser (I) circa 1300 BC, but this is possibly simply an indication that he rebuilt it. Later on, the site seems to have become neglected, for Assur-nacir-apli states that, the city having fallen into ruin, he rebuilt it, and it thereafter became practically the capital of the country, for he not only reerected or restored its shrines and temples--the temple of Ninip, with the god&#x27;s image; the temple of &quot;the Lady of the Land,&quot; and the temples of Sin, Gula, and Enlil--but he also received tribute there. Among his other works may be mentioned the water-channel Pati-chengala, and the plantations, whose fruits, apparently, he offered to the god Assur (Asshur), and the temples of the city. It also became a favorite place of residence for the later kings of Assyria,&#x27; who built palaces, and restored the city&#x27;s temples from time to time.3. Its Position:Calah occupied the roughly triangular tract formed by the junction of the Greater Zab with the Tigris, which latter stream in ancient times flowed rather closer to the western wall than it does now, and would seem to have separated the small town represented by Selamiyeh from the extensive ruins of Calah, which now bear the name of Nimroud. The main ruins are situated on a large, rectangular platform on the bank of the old bed of the Tigris.4. The Temple-Tower:The most prominent edifice was the great Temple-tower at the Northwest corner--a step-pyramid (ziq-qurat) like the Bah towers, constructed of brick faced with stone, and rising, in stages, to a height of circa 126 ft., probably with a sanctuary at the top (see BABEL, TOWER OF). A long vault occupies the basement-stage of this structure, and caused Sir A. H. Layard, its discoverer, to regard it as the probable traditional tomb of Ninus, under whose shadow the tragedy of Pyramis and Thisbe took place. Ovid (Metam. iv.98) describes the tomb of Ninus as having been situated &quot;at the entrance of Nineveh,&quot; and, if this be correct, Calah must have been regarded as the southern portion of that grea...</p>

He represents the tribe of Judah as its prince (Nu 13:6; compare Nu 13:2). While the majority of the men sent out by Moses bring back evil report, Caleb and Hoshea, or Joshua, the son of Nun, are the only ones to counsel the invasion of the promised land (Nu 13:30; 14:6 ff). Accordingly, these two alone are permitted to survive (Nu 14:38; 32:12). Upon the conquest and distribution of the land by Joshua, Caleb reminds the leader of the promise made by God through Moses, and so he receives Hebron as an inheritance for himself and his descendants (Jos 14:6-15), after driving out from thence the Anakim who were in possession of the city (Jos 15:14). In the parallel account in Jud 1:8 ff, the dispossession of the Canaanite inhabitants of Hebron is ascribed to Judah (Jud 1:10). Both accounts agree in mentioning Othniel, a younger brother of Caleb, as the conqueror of Kiriath-sepher or Debir; as his reward he receives the hand of Achsah, Caleb&#x27;s daughter. Achsah is given by her father a portion of the Southland; but, upon request, she obtains a more fruitful locality with upper and nether springs (Jos 15:15-19; Jud 1:12-15).In 1Sa 30:14 Caleb is undoubtedly the name of a clan which is, moreover, differentiated from Judah. Modern scholars therefore assume that Caleb was originally an independent clan which in historical times merged with Judah. As Caleb is called the son f Kenaz (Jud 1:13) or the Kenizzite (Nu 32:12), it is further believed that the Calebites were originally associated with an Edomite clan named Kenaz (Ge 36:11), and that they entered their future homes in the southern part of Palestine from the south. Their migration up north would then be reflected in the story of the spies.In the genealogical tables (1Ch 2), Caleb is made a descendant of Judah through his father Hezron. He is the brother of Jerahmeel, and the &quot;father&quot; of Hebron and of other towns in Judah. (Chelubai, 1Ch 9:9, is apparently identical with Caleb.)Nabal, with whom David had an encounter, is called a Calebite, i.e. one belonging to the house of Caleb (1Sa 25:3).Max. L. Margolis</p>

The first rested on observation merely, the second on observation coupled with calculation, and the third on calculation only. In the first period the priests determined the beginning of each month by the appearance of the new moon and the recurrence of the prescribed feasts from the vernal and autumnal equinoxes. Thus, the month Abib (&#x27;abhibh), the first month of the year according to the Levitical law, in which the Passover was to be celebrated, was determined by observation (Ex 12:2; De 16). After the exile more accurate methods of determining the months and seasons came into vogue, and calculation was employed to supplement and correct observations and the calendar was regulated according to the Babylonian system, as is evidenced by the names of the months which are derived from it. In later times the calendar was fixed by mathematical methods (see the article &quot;Calendar&quot; in the Jewish Encyclopedia). The difficulty of ascertaining the first day of the new moon by observation, in the early period, led to the celebration of two days, as seems to be indicated in 1Sa 20:27. We have only four names of months belonging to the pre-exilic period, and they are Phoenician. Of these Abib (&#x27;abhibh) was the first month, as already indicated, and it corresponded to Nis (nican) in the later calendar. It was the month in which the Exodus occurred and the month of the Passover (Ex 13:4; 23:15; 34:18; De 16:1).The 2nd month of this calendar was Ziv (ziw) (1Ki 6:1,37); Ethanim (&#x27;ethanim) was the 7th (1Ki 8:2), corresponding to Tishri of the later calendar, and Bul (bul) the 8th, corresponded to Marchesvan (marcheshwan) (1Ki 6:38). There were course other month names in this old calendar, but they have not come down to us. These names refer to the aspects of the seasons: thus Abib (&#x27;abhibh) means grain in the ear, just ripening (Le 2:14; Ex 9:31); Ziv (ziw) refers to the beauty and splendor of the flowers in the spring; Ethanim (&#x27;ethanim) means perennial, probably referring to living fountains; and Bul (bul) means rain or showers, being the month when the rainy season commenced. The full calendar of months used in the postexilic period is given in a table accompanying this article. The names given in the table are not all found in the Bible, as the months are usually referred to by number, but we find Nican in Ne 2:1 and Es 3:7; Siwan in Es 8:9; Tammuz in Eze 8:4, although the term as here used refers to a Phoenician god after whom the month was named; &#x27;Elul occurs in Ne 6:15; Kiclew (the American Standard Revised Version &quot;chislev&quot;) in Ne 1:1 and Zec 7:1; Tebheth in Es 2:16; ShebhaT in Zec 1:7 and &#x27;Adhar in Ezr 6:15 and several times in Est.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kaf (`eghel; par, or par, often rendered &quot;bullock&quot;): The etymology of both words is uncertain, but the former has a close parallel in the Arabic `ijl, &quot;calf.&quot; Par is generally used of animals for sacrifice, `eghel, in that and other senses. `Eghel is used of the golden calves and frequently in the expression, `eghel marbeq, &quot;fatted calf,&quot; or &quot;calf of the stall,&quot; the latter being the literal meaning (1Sa 28:24; Jer 46:21; Am 6:4; Mal 4:2).At the present day beef is not highly esteemed by the people of the country, but mutton is much prized. In the houses of the peasantry it is common to see a young ram being literally stuffed with food, mulberry or other leaves being forced into its mouth by one of the women, who then works the sheep&#x27;s jaw with one hand. The animal has a daily bath of cold water. The result is deliciously fat and tender mutton. Such an animal is called a ma`luf. From the same root we have ma`laf, &quot;manger,&quot; suggestive of the Hebrew marbeq, &quot;stall.&quot;The calf for sacrifice was usually a male of a year old. Other references to calves are: &quot;to skip like a calf&quot; (Ps 29:6); &quot;the calf and the young lion and the fatling together&quot; (Isa 11:6); &quot;a habitation deserted .... there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof&quot; (Isa 27:10).See CATTLE.Alfred Ely Day</p>

Jeroboam&#x27;s Golden CalvesIII. ATTITUDE OF ELIJAH TO THE BULL SYMBOLSIV. ATTITUDE OF AMOS AND HOSEA TO THE BULL SYMBOLSLITERATUREI. The Name.The term `eghel, is the ordinary Hebrew name for a male calf and is as flexible as the English name, applying to any animal from one a year old (Mic 6:6) or perhaps younger (Le 9:3; 12:6) to one three years old (Ge 15:9; compare Jer 34:18,19). It has been thought that the habitual use of this diminutive term for the golden bulls which Aaron and Jeroboam set up--especially as it is twice made feminine (Ho 10:5; 13:2)--was intended to indicate their small size and thus to express contempt for them. This however, though plausible, is by no means certain. It was not their size which made these bulls contemptible in the eyes of the prophets, and besides there were no life-size bulls of molten gold in any surrounding countries so far as known. The reference to female calves that were kissed (Ho 13:2), presumably at Bethel, may refer not to the worship of the bulls, but to their female counterparts, since in all other countries such female deities invariably accompanied the bull gods. Bethel may be especially mentioned because it was the &quot;king&#x27;s sanctuary&quot; (Am 7:13) or because of the multitude of altars and high places found there (Ho 10:8; compare Ho 8:11; Am 5:26). False worship is also mentioned in connection with Jeroboam&#x27;s apostasy, at Gilgal and Gilead (Ho 4:15; 12:11; Am 4:4; 5:5), Samaria (Ho 8:6; 10:5; 13:2,16); and Beersheba (Am 5:5; 8:14) where no bulls had been set up by Jeroboam so far as stated. That these places receive more condemnation than Dan--which is explicitly mentioned in only one passage (Am 8:14) though it was a chief center of the bull worship (1Ki 12:30)--may be due to the fact that the worship of the female deity was the more popular. This was certainly true in neighboring countries and also in other cities in Palestine, as has recently been proved by the excavations (see below).II. Ancient Calf Worship.The origin of animal worship is hidden in obscurity, but reverence for the bull and cow is found widespread among the most ancient historic cults. Even in the prehistoric age the influence of the bull symbol was so powerful that it gave its name to one of the most important signs of the Zodiac, and from early historic times the horns of the bull were the familiar emblem of the rays of the sun, and solar gods were very commonly represented as bull-gods (Jensen, Kosmologie, 62-90; Winckler, Altorientalische Forschungen, 1901-5, passim; Jeremias, Das Alter der bah. Astronomie, 1909, passim). The Egyptians, close neighbors of the Hebrews, in all eras from that of the Exodus onward, worshipped living bulls at Memphis (not Mendes, as EB) and Hellopolls as incarnations of Ptah and Ra, while one of the most elaborate rituals was connected with the life-size image of the Hathor-cow (Naville, Deir el Bahari, Part ...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kol&#x27;-ing (klesis, from kaleo, &quot;I call&quot;): Is a New Testament expression. The word is used chiefly by Paul, though the idea and term are found also elsewhere. It has a definite, technical sense, the invitation given to men by God to accept salvation in His kingdom through Jesus Christ. This invitation is given outwardly by the preaching of the gospel, inwardly by the work of the Holy Spirit. With reference to Israel, it is on the part of God irrevocable, not repented of. Having in His eternal counsel called this people, He entrusted them with great gifts, and because He did thus enrich them, He also, in the course of time, summoned them to fulfill the task of initiating the world into the way of salvation, and of preparing salvation for the world. Therefore, He will not desert His people, for He Will not revoke that call (Ro 11:29). This calling is high or upward, in Christ, that is, made in heaven by God on account of Christ and calling man to heaven (Php 3:14). Similarly it is a heavenly calling (Heb 3:1); also a holy calling, holy in aim, means, and end (2Ti 1:9). Christians are urged to walk worthy of this calling (Eph 4:1) (the American Standard Revised Version and the Revised Version (British and American), but the King James Version has &quot;vocation&quot;). In it there is hope; it is the inspirer of hope, and furnishes for hope its supreme object (Eph 4:4). Men are exhorted so to live that God will count them worthy of their calling (2Th 1:11). They are also urged to make their calling and election sure (2Pe 1:10). See ELECTION. There is a somewhat peculiar use of the word in 1Co 1:26 and 1Co 7:20, namely, that condition of life in which men were when God called them, not many of them wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, some circumcised, some uncircumcised, some bond, some free, some male, some female, some married, some unmarried.George Henry Trever</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kal&#x27;-ne (kalneh; Chalanne): The name of the fourth city of Nimrod&#x27;s kingdom (Ge 10:10), the three preceding it being Babel, Erech, and Accad, i.e. the capital of the realm of Babylonia and the chief cities of three of the principal states. The meaning of the name is unknown, and many regard the identification as uncertain athers and burned C. who had fled into an outhouse with others who had set the sacred gates on fire, &quot;the meet reward of their impiety&quot; (2 Macc 8:33).1. Identified with Nippur:G. Rawlinson thought it to be the modern Niffer (or Noufar), comparing the Talmudic (compare Yoma&#x27;) Nopher, which is said to be the same as Calneh. What place-name Calneh corresponds with in cuneiform is doubtful. Fried. Delitzsch (Wo lag das Paradies?) compared it with Kul-unu, but as we are told to pronounce this group as Kullaba, it seems unlikely that there is any connection between the two. The identification proposed by G. Rawlinson, however, may be regarded as being supported by the bilingual Creation-legend, in which Merodach (= Nimrod) is made the founder of Babylon, Erech and Nippur, which would in that case be three of the four cities mentioned in Ge 10:10.2. Nippur&#x27;s Importance:The inscriptions reveal to us Nippur as a city with a glorious past. Sargon of Agade, Sur-Engur, Dungi and all the more prominent kings of Babylonia in its larger sense interested themselves in the rebuilding and restoration of its renowned temples, so as to gain the favor of their great divinities.3. Its Deities and Their Legends:The city&#x27;s earlier divine patrons were Enlil and Ninlil, the older Bel and Beltis, whose shrines were at the great temple-tower called E-kura, &quot;the house of the land,&quot; and a poetical legend in Sumerian (dialectical) recording their visit to the city, and enumerating its sacred places, still exists (PSBA, March, 1911, 85 ff). Later, the chief deities of the city seem to have been Ninip, the son of Enlil, and his spouse Nin-Nipri, &quot;the lady of Nippur.&quot; These two divine beings likewise evoked the muse of the city-scribes, who dealt with the glories of the god in a composition extending over several tablets, in which his favor to his spouse Nin-Nipri is extolled; and to whom a career very similar to that of Merodach, the head of the Babylonian pantheon, is attributed (PSBA, December, 1906, 270 ff).4. Its Ruins Today:The great temple-tower of Niffer, which was dedicated to the god Enlil, was a very striking object among the buildings and temples of the city, and the lower stages are still in an extremely perfect condition. Most interesting, also, are the remains of streets and houses which enable the general conditions of life in ancient Babylonia to be estimated, and suggest that they are similar to those subsisting even at the present day. Our knowledge of the city is almost entirely due to the American excavations at Niffer, inaugurated by J. P. Peters, which have been most fruitful and have shed quite a new light on the city&#x27;s history. See Peter...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kavz, (Septuagint: karpon cheileon): This is the King James Version rendering of a dubious Hebrew text in Ho 14:2 (parim sephathenu). The Revised Version (British and American) runs &quot;So will we render as bullocks the offering of our lips.&quot; Strange as the text is, it may be retained, and it admits of at least a possible explanation. The prophet calls on his contemporaries to return in penitence to Yahweh. Their worship should consist not of meaningless dumb ritual, but of &quot;words&quot;--hymns and prayers, expressive of real gratitude and of actual needs--or perhaps pledges of repentance and reform. The people respond and undertake that their worship shall consist of &quot;calves or bullocks of lips,&quot; i.e. not of animal offerings, but of promises of reform or vows of obedience. But this explanation is forced and most modern commentators follow the Septuagint, which presupposes a slightly different Hebrew text, and renders peri sephathenu, &quot;fruit of our lips,&quot; i.e. adoring gratitude or, as the author of the Epistle to the He, who quotes this verse from the Septuagint, explains it, &quot;sacrifice of praise&quot; (Heb 13:15). The same phrase occurs in Isa 57:19, where it signifies gladsome gratitude.T. Lewis</p>

Some have thought that he is the Ahasuerus of Ezr 4:6. This seems to be most improbable, inasmuch as the Hebrew form of Ahasuerus is the exact equivalent of the Old Persian form of Xerxes, and we have no evidence that Cambyses was ever called Xerxes.Ancient authorities differ as to who was the mother of Cambyses. It is variously said that she was Cassandane, a Persian princess, Amytis, a Median princess, or Nititis, a daughter of Apries king of Egypt. He had one brother, Bardes or Smerdes, whom he put to death secretly shortly after his accession, probably because of an attempted rebellion. Cambyses organized an expedition for the conquest of Egypt, which was rendered successful by internal treachery and by the aid of the Phoenician, Cyprian and Greek fleets. During this campaign Cambyses seems to have acted with good generalship and with clemency toward the conquered. After the subjugation of Egypt, Cyrene and Barca, the modern Tripoli, submitted to his sway. He then desired to undertake the conquest of Carthage, but was compelled to give it up, because his Phoenician allies, without whose ships it was impossible for him to conduct his army in safety, refused to join in an attack upon a country that had been colonized by them. He is said to have sent an army of 50,000 men against the oasis of Jupiter Ammon. This army is said to have perished in the sands. A little less unsuccessful expedition was made against Ethiopia. After some initial successes, Cambyses was forced to return to Egypt with the shattered remains of his army. He found that the Egyptians were in revolt, led by their king Psammetichus III, whose life he had formerly spared. This revolt was put down with great harshness, the Egyptian king being taken and executed, and many of the temples being destroyed. Shortly after this, Cambyses heard that a certain Magian, who claimed to be his brother Smerdes whom he had secretly put to death, had set himself up as king of Persia, and that almost the whole of his Asiatic dominions had acknowledged him as king. With the fragments of his army he started toward Persia to attack the usurper, but on the way was killed by a wound inflicted by himself, it is uncertain whether by accident or with intention. His general and cousin, Darius Hystaspis, soon put down the false Smerdis and reigned in his stead.For two or more years Cambyses was king of Babylon, while his father was king of the lands. The son was a drunkard and subject to fits of unbridled passion, but seems to have been of good capacity as a general and as an administrator. Many of the tales that have been told against him were doubtless invented by his enemies, and he has left us no records of his own. That he married his own sisters is probable; but it must be remembered that this was the custom of the Egyptian kings of that time and ma...</p>

The latter inhabits the temperate and cold parts of central Asia and is not likely to have been known to Biblical writers. The Arabian camel inhabits southwestern Asia and northern Africa and has recently been introduced into parts of America and Australia. Its hoofs are not typical of ungulates but are rather like great claws. The toes are not completely separated and the main part of the foot which is applied to the ground is a large pad which underlies the proximal joints of the digits. It may be that this incomplete separation of the two toes is a sufficient explanation of the words &quot;parteth not the hoof,&quot; in Le 11:4 and De 14:7. Otherwise these words present a difficulty, because the hoofs are completely separated though the toes are not. The camel is a ruminant and chews the cud like a sheep or ox, but the stomach possesses only three compartments instead of four, as in other ruminants. The first two compartments contain in their walls small pouches, each of which can be closed by a sphincter muscle. The fluid retained in these pouches may account in part for the power of the camel to go for a relatively long time without drinking.The Arabian camel is often compared with justice to the reindeer of the Esquimaux. It furnishes hair for spinning and weaving, milk, flesh and leather, as well as being an of invaluable means of transportation in the arid desert. There are many Arabic names for the camel, the commonest of which is jamal (in Egypt gamal), the root being common to Arabic, Hebrew and other Semitic languages. From it the names in Latin, Greek, English and various European languages are derived. There are various breeds camels, as there are of horses. The riding camels or dromedaries, commonly called hajin, can go, even at a walk, much faster than the pack camels. The males are mostly used for carrying burdens, the females being kept with the herds. Camels are used to a surprising extent on the rough roads of the mountains, and one finds in the possession of fellachin in the mountains and on the littoral plain larger and stronger pack camels than are often found among the Bedouin. Camels were apparently not much used by the Israelites after the time of the patriarchs. They were taken as spoil of war from the Amalekites and other tribes, but nearly the only reference to their use by the lat...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(triches kamelou): In Mt 3:4 and Mr 1:6 the description of John&#x27;s raiment is explicit to the extent of telling the kind of hair of which his raiment was made. It is probable that his garment was made of a tawed camel skin, for the more expensive woven camel&#x27;s hair garment would not be in keeping with the rest of the description. It is still common among the poor in some parts of Syria, when a camel or other animal dies, to remove its skin and, after treating the inner surface to stop decomposition, to make it up into various domestic articles. The writer once saw a peasant dragging a skin along the road which proved to be that of a donkey which had just died on the route. His intention was probably to make it up into a cloak. Some believe that Elijah&#x27;s mantle was of camel&#x27;s hair (2Ki 1:8; compare Zec 13:4). Of that we cannot be sure, for in the East today the hairy garment is usually goat&#x27;s hair or wool either woven or still clinging to the skin. It was much more likely to have been one of these latter. See SHEEP. Camel&#x27;s hair, when woven into fabrics, as in rugs, makes an article of even softer and more glossy texture than wool.See WEAVING.James A. Patch</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ka&#x27;-na, (Kana tes Galilaias): This was the scene of Christ&#x27;s earliest miracle, when, at the marriage feast, He turned water into wine (Joh 2:1 ff). It was the home of Nathaniel (Joh 21:2). From Cana, after the marriage, Jesus &quot;went down&quot; to Capernaum (Joh 2:12), and returned at the request of the centurion (Joh 4:46,51). These are the only notices of Cana in Scripture, and from them we learn merely that it was in Galilee, and in the uplands West of the lake. Other villages of the same name are mentioned by Josephus, but probably this one is intended by the Cana where for a time he dwelt (Vita, 16) which he locates in the plain of Asochis (ibid., 41). The Greek kana probably transliterates an old Hebrew qanah, &quot;place of reeds.&quot; This ancient name survives in Khirbet Qana, a ruined site with rockhewn tombs, cisterns and a pool, on the northern edge of Sahl el-Battauf, the plain of Asochis. Near by are marshy stretches where reeds still abound: the name therefore is entirely appropriate. The name Qana el-Jelil , the exact Arabic equivalent of Kana tes Galilaias, is also heard among the natives. This, however, may have arisen from the suggested identification with Cana of the Gospel. The position agrees well enough with the Gospel data.Kefr Kennah, a thriving village about 3 3/4 miles from Nazareth, on the southern edge of Sahl Tor`an, the plain South of the range of that name, through which the road from Nazareth to Tiberias passes, has also many advocates. This identification is accepted by the Greek and Latin churches, which have both built extensively in the village; the Greeks showing stone jars said to have been used in the miracle, and the traditional house of Nathaniel being pointed out. A copious spring of excellent water rises West of the village; and the pomegranates grown here are greatly prized. The change of name, however, from Qana to Kennah--(note the doubled n), is not easy; and there are no reeds in the neighborhood to give the name any appropriateness.Onom locates Cana in the tribe of Asher toward Great Sidon, probably thinking of Kana, a village about 8 miles South of Tyre. The pilgrims of the Middle Ages seem to be fairly divided as to the two sites. Saewulf (1102), Brocardius (1183), Marinus Sanutus (1321), Breydenbach (1483) and Anselm (1507) favor the northern site; while on the side of Kefr Kennah may be reckoned Paula (383), Willibald (720), Isaac Chelo (1334) and Quaresimus (1616). It seems pretty certain that the Crusaders adopted the identification with Khirbet Kana (Conder, Tent Work, 69 f). While no absolute decision is possible, on the available evidence probability points to the northern site.Col. Conder puts in a claim for a third site, that of `Ain Kana on the road from er-Reineh (a village about 1 1/2 mile from Nazareth on the Tiberias road) to Tabor (Tent Work, 81).W. Ewing</p>

This indicates the Mosaic period when the conquerors of the XVIIIth and XIXth Egyptian Dynasties made Canaan for a time a province of the Egyptian empire. Under the Pharaoh Meneptah, at the time of the Exodus, it ceased to be connected with Egypt, and the Egyptian garrisons in the South of the country were expelled by the Philistines, who probably made themselves masters of the larger portion of it, thus causing the name of Philistia or Palestine to become synonymous with that of Canaan (see Ze 2:5). In the Tell el-Amarna Letters, Canaan is written Kinakhna and Kinakhkhi. The latter form corresponds with the Greek (Chna), a name given to Phoenicia (Hecat. Fragments 254; Eusebius, praep. Ev., i.10; ix.17).1. Geography:In Nu 13:29 the Canaanites are described as dwelling &quot;by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan,&quot; i.e. in the lowlands of Palestine. The name was confined to the country West of the Jordan (Nu 33:51; Jos 22:9), and was especially applied to Phoenicia (Isa 23:11; compare Mt 15:22). Hence, Sidon is called the &quot;firstborn&quot; of Canaan (Ge 10:15, though compare Jud 3:3), and the Septuagint translates &quot;Canaanites&quot; by &quot;Phoenicians&quot; and &quot;Canaan&quot; by the &quot;land of the Phoenicians&quot; (Ex 16:35; Jos 5:12). Kinakhkhi is used in the same restricted sense in the Tell el-Amarna Letters, but it is also extended so as to include Palestine generally. On the other hand, on the Egyptian monuments Seti I calls a town in the extreme South of Palestine &quot;the city of Pa-Kana&#x27;na&quot; or &quot;the Canaan,&quot; which Conder identifies with the modern Khurbet Kenan near Hebron. As in the Tell el-Amarna Letters, so in the Old Testament, Canaan is used in an extended sense to denote the whole of Palestine West of the Jordan (Ge 12:5; 23:2,19; 28:1; 31:18; 35:6; 36:2; 37:1; 48:7; Ex 15:15; Nu 13:2; Jos 14:1; 21:2; Ps 135:11). Thus, Jerusalem which had Amorite and Hittite founders is stated to be of &quot;the land of the Canaanite&quot; (Eze 16:3), and Isa 19:18 terms Hebrew, which was shared by the Israelites with the Phoenicians and, apparently, also the Amorites, &quot;the language of Caaan.&quot; Jabin is called &quot;the king of Canaan&quot; in Jud 4:2,23,24; but whether the name is employed here in a restricted or extended sense is uncertain.2. Meaning of the Name:As the Phoenicians were famous as traders, it has been supposed that the name &quot;Canaanite&quot; is a synonym of &quot;merchant&quot; in certain passages of the Old Testament. The pursuit of trade, however, was characteristic only of the maritime cities of Phoenicia, not of the Canaanitish towns conquered the Israelites. In Isa 23:11 we should t...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ka-nalz&#x27; (ye&#x27;orim): The word &quot;canals&quot; occurs in several places in the Revised Version, margin (Ex 7:19; 8:5; Isa 19:6; Na 3:8). ye&#x27;or is an Egyptian word, the designation of the Nile (Brugsch, Geogr, I, 8, 78). The proper name of the Nile as a god was Hapi. There were several common designations of the Nile, but the usual one was ye&#x27;or, Hebrew plural ye&#x27;orim. The primary meaning of ye&#x27;or in Egyptian is not certain, but its significance in use for the Nile is plain enough. All the waters in Egypt were of the Nile and this word ye&#x27;or was used to denote all of them, the Nile and all its ramifications through the whole irrigating system. Thus ye&#x27;orim, Niles, came to be used. As only the main channels of the Nile had much current, the ye&#x27;orim came naturally to convey the idea of sluggishness. In the account of the plagues (Ex 7:19), names are used descriptively to designate the different waters of Egypt: neharoth, &quot;flowing streams,&quot; for the main channels of the river, and ye&#x27;orim for other streams, which by contrast must mean, as it should according to its use by the Egyptians, &quot;the sluggish streams,&quot; i.e. &quot;canals,&quot; as it is rendered by the Revisers. This meaning of the word being thus clearly established, it is appropriately used in the Revised Version, margin in the other instances of its occurrence in like circumstances.M. G. Kyle</p>

In all places except Jer 25:10 and Ze 1:12 (see margin) the Revised Version (British and American) gives the more exact rendering &quot;lamp.&quot; See LAMP. Candle, in our sense of the term, was unknown to antiquity.(2) &quot;Candlestick&quot; stands for what was a common and indispensable article of ancient house furniture, a lamp-stand (menorah). Accordingly we find it mentioned in a case thoroughly representative of the furnishings of an oriental room of the plainer sort, in the account of &quot;the prophet&#x27;s chamber&quot; given in 2Ki 4:10. Here we find that the furniture consisted of a &quot;bed,&quot; a &quot;table,&quot; a &quot;seat,&quot; and a &quot;candlestick,&quot; or lamp-stand. The excavations of Petrie and Bliss at Lachish (Tell el-Hesy, 104), not to mention others, help to make it clear that a lamp-stand is meant in passages where the Hebrew word, menorah, or its Greek equivalent luchnia, is used. Accordingly throughout the New Testament, the Revised Version (British and American) has consistently rendered luchnia by &quot;stand&quot; (Mt 5:15; Mr 4:21; Lu 8:16; 11:33).(3) The &quot;candlestick&quot; of Da 5:5 is rather the candelabrum (nebhrashta&#x27;) of Belshazzar&#x27;s banqueting-hall. The &quot;golden candlestick&quot; of the tabernacle and the temple requires special treatment.See CANDLESTICK, THE GOLDEN; TABERNACLE.(4) Certain figurative uses of &quot;candle&quot; and &quot;candlestick&quot; in the Bible demand attention. The ancient and still common custom of the East of keeping a house lamp burning night and day gave rise to the figure of speech so universally found in oriental languages by which the continued prosperity of the individual or the family is set forth by the perennially burning lamp (see Job 29:3; &quot;when his lamp shined upon my head&quot;; Ps 18:28 &quot;Thou wilt light my lamp&quot;). The converse in usage is seen in many passages--(see Job 18:6; &quot;His lamp above him shall be put out&quot;; 21:17: &quot;How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out&quot;; Pr 24:20; &quot;The lamp of the wicked shall be put out&quot;; Jer 25:10; &quot;Take from them .... the light of the lamp&quot;). The same metaphor is used in Re 2:5 to indicate the judgment with candlestick out of its place.&quot; &quot;The seven golden candlesticks&quot; (Re 1:20) which John saw were &quot;the seven churches,&quot; the appointed light-bearers and dispensers of the religion of the risen Christ.

The Tabernacle:The candlestick is first met with in the descriptions of the tabernacle (Ex 25:31-39; 37:17-24). It was, with the utensils connected with it (snuffers, snuff dishes), to be made of pure beaten gold, of one piece, a talent in weight (Ex 25:39). It consisted of a pedestal or base, of a central stem (the name &quot;candlestick&quot; is specially given to this), of six curving branches--three on each side--and of seven lamps resting on the tops of the branches and stem. Stem and branches were ornamented with cups like almond-blossoms, knops and flowers--four of this series on the stem, and three on each of the branches. Some, however, understand the &quot;cup&quot; to embrace the &quot;knop&quot; and &quot;flower&quot; (calyx and corolla). The shape of the pedestal is uncertain. Jewish tradition suggests three small feet; the representation of the candlestick on the Arch of Titus has a solid, hexagonal base. The position of the candlestick was on the South side of the holy place (Ex 40:24).2. Temple of Solomon:In Solomon&#x27;s temple the single golden candlestick was multiplied to ten, and the position was altered. The candlesticks were now placed in front of the Holy of Holies, five on one side, five on the other (1Ki 7:49; 2Ch 4:7). Further details are not given in the texts, from which it may be presumed that the model of the tabernacle candlestick was followed.3. Temple of Zerubbabel:The second temple reverted to the single golden candlestick. When the temple was plundered by Antiochus Epiphanes, the candlestick was taken away (1 Macc 1:21); after the cleansing, a new one was made by Judas Maccabeus (1 Macc 4:49,50).4. Temple of Herod:The same arrangement of a single golden candlestick, placed on the South side of the holy place, was continued in Herod&#x27;s Temple (Josephus, BJ, V, v, 5). It was this which, carried away by Titus, was represented on his Arch at Rome.5. Use and Symbolism:The immediate object of the candlestick was to give light in the holy place. The lamps were lighted in the evening and burned till the morning (Ex 30:7,8; Le 24:3; 1Sa 3:3; 2Ch 13:11), light being admitted into the temple during the day by the upper windows. Josephus in his Cosmical speculations (BJ, V, v, 5) takes the seven lamps to signify the seven planets. In Zechariah&#x27;s vision of the golden candlestick (Zec 4:2 ff), the seven lamps are fed by two olive trees which are interpreted to be &quot;the two anointed ones,&quot; Zerubbabel and Joshua--the civil and spiritual representatives of theocracy. The candlestick here, like the seven candlesticks in Re 1:20; 2:1, symbolizes the church of God, then in its Old Testament form, the idea conveyed being that God&#x27;s church is set to be a lightgiver in the world. Compare Christ&#x27;s words (Mt 5:14,16; Lu 12:35), and Paul&#x27;s (Php 2:15).The oldest known representation of the seven-branched candlestick is on a coi...</p>

One codex of De Rossi has made this identification in the passage in Eze 27:23. Cornill thinks Canneh is the Calneh of Am 6:2, but Cheyne thinks the name is really non-existent.

Two Preliminary Considerations.The canon is the collection of 27 books which the church (generally) receives as its New Testament Scriptures. The history of the canon is the history of the process by which these books were brought together and their value as sacred Scriptures officially recognized. That process was gradual, furthered by definite needs, and, though unquestionably continuous, is in its earlier stages difficult to trace. It is always well in turning to the study of it to have in mind two considerations which bear upon the earliest phases of the whole movement. These are:1. Early Christians Had the Old Testament:The early Christians had in their hands what was a Bible to them, namely, the Old Testament Scriptures. These were used to a surprising extent in Christian instruction. For a whole century after the death of Jesus this was the case. These Scriptures were read in the churches, and there could be at first no idea of placing beside them new books which could for a moment rank with them in honor and authority. It has been once and again discussed whether Christianity from the first was a &quot;book-religion.&quot; The decision of the matter depends upon what is referred to by the word &quot;book.&quot; Christianity certainly did have from the very beginning a book which it reverenced--the Old Testament--but years passed before it had even the beginnings of a book of its own. What has been called &quot;the wealth of living canonical material,&quot; namely, prophets and teachers, made written words of subordinate value. In this very teaching, however, with its oral traditions lay the beginnings of that movement which was ultimately to issue in a canon of writings.2. No Intention of Writing the New Testament:When the actual work of writing began no one who sent forth an epistle or framed a gospel had before him the definite purpose of contributing toward the formation of what we call &quot;the Bible.&quot; All the New Testament writers looked for &quot;the end&quot; as near. Their words, therefore, were to meet definite needs in the lives of those with whom they were associated. They had no thought of creating a new sacred literature. And yet these incidental occasional writings have come to be our choicest Scripture. The circumstances and influences which brought about this result are here briefly set forth.II. Three Stages of the Process.For convenience of arrangement and definiteness of impression the whole process may be marked off in three stages:(1) that from the time of th...</p>

Introductory.The problem of how we came by 39 books known as Old Testament &quot;Scripture&quot; is a purely historical investigation. The question involved is, not who wrote the several books, but who made them into a collection, not their origin or contents, but their history; not God&#x27;s part, but man&#x27;s. Our present aim, accordingly, must be to trace the process by which the various writings became &quot;Scripture.&quot;1. The Christian Term &quot;Canon&quot;:The word &quot;canon&quot; is of Christian origin, from the Greek word kanon, which in turn is probably borrowed from the Hebrew word, qaneh, meaning a reed or measuring rod, hence, norm or rule. Later it came to mean a rule of faith, and eventually a catalogue or list. In present usage it signifies a collection of religious writings Divinely inspired and hence, authoritative, normative, sacred and binding. The term occurs in Ga 6:16; 2Co 10:13-16; but it is first employed of the books of Scripture in the technical sense of a standard collection or body of sacred writings, by the church Fathers of the 4th century; e. g. in the 59th canon of the Council of Laodicea (363 AD); in the Festal Epistle of Athanasius (365 AD); and by Amphilochius, archbishop of Iconium (395 AD).2. The Corresponding Hebrew Expression:How the ancient Hebrews expressed the conception of canonicity is not known; but it is safe to say that the idea, as an idea, existed long before there was any special phrase invented to express it. In the New Testament the word &quot;Scriptures&quot; conveys unquestionably the notion of sacredness (Mt 21:42; Joh 5:39; Ac 18:24). From the 1st century AD and following, however, according to the Talmud, the Jews employed the phrase &quot;defile the hands.&quot; Writings which were suitable to be read in the synagogue were designated as books which &quot;defile the hands.&quot; What this very peculiar oriental expression may have originally signified no one definitely knows. Probably Le 16:24 gives a hint of the true interpretation. According to this passage the high pries...</p>

In Ps 19:5 (Hebrew 19:6) chuppah is used of the bridegroom&#x27;s chamber and in Joe 2:16 of the bride&#x27;s. Among the Hebrews the chuppah was originally the chamber in which the bride awaited the groom for the marital union. In Judith 10:21; 13:9,15; 16:19 the word canopy occurs as the English equivalent of the Greek konopeion, which was primarily a mosquito-net and then a canopy over a bed, whether for useful or for decorative purposes.John Richard Sampey</p>

Largely on account of its habit of growing out of crevasses in old walls it has been identified by some with the HYSSOP (which see). The familiar &quot;capers&quot; of commerce are the young buds, but the berries were the parts most used in ancient times; their repute as excitants of sexual desire is ancient and widespread. Various parts of this plant are still used for medical purposes by the modern peasants of Palestine.E. W. G. Masterman</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ka-per&#x27;-na-um (Kapernaoum (Textus Receptus), Kapharnaoum (Codex Vaticanus, Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Bezae; etc.)): The woe spoken by the Master against this great city has been fulfilled to the uttermost (Mt 11:23; Lu 10:15). So completely has it perished that the very site is a matter of dispute today. In Scripture Capernaum is not mentioned outside the Gospels. When Jesus finally departed from Nazareth, He dwelt in Capernaum (Mt 4:13) and made it the main center of His activity during a large part of His public ministry. Near by He called the fishermen to follow Him (Mr 1:16), and the publican from the receipt of custom (Mt 9:9, etc.). It was the scene of many &quot;mighty works&quot; (Mt 11:23; Mr 1:34). Here Jesus healed the centurion&#x27;s son (Mt 8:5, etc.), the nobleman&#x27;s son (Joh 4:46), Simon Peter&#x27;s mother-in-law (Mr 1:31, etc.), and the paralytic (Mt 9:1, etc.); cast out the unclean spirit (Mr 1:23, etc.); and here also, probably, He raised Jairus&#x27; daughter to life (Mr 5:22, etc.). In Capernaum the little child was used to teach the disciples humility, while in the synagogue Jesus delivered His ever-memorable discourse on the bread of life (Joh 6). From the notices in the Gospels we gather that Capernaum was a city of considerable importance. Some think that the words &quot;shalt thou be exalted,&quot; etc. (Mt 11:23; Lu 10:15), mean that it stood on an elevated site. Perhaps more naturally they refer to the excessive pride of the inhabitants in their city. It was a customs station, and the residence of a high officer of the king (Mt 9:9; Joh 4:46, etc.). It was occupied by a detachment of Roman soldiers, whose commander thought the good will of the people worth securing at the expense of building for them a synagogue (Mt 8:5; Lu 7:5). It stood by the sea (Mt 4:13) and from Joh 6:17 ff (compare Mt 14:34; Mr 6:53), we see that it was either in or near the plain of Gennesaret.Josephus twice mentions Capernaum. It played no great part in the history of his time, and seems to have declined in importance, as he refers to it as a &quot;village.&quot; In battle in el-BaTeichah his horse fell into a quagmire, and he suffered injury which disabled him for further fighting. His soldiers carried him to the village of Capernaum (this reference is however doubtful; the name as it stands is Kepharnomon which Niese corrects to Kepharnokon), whence he was removed to Tarichea (Vita, 72). Again he eulogizes the plain of Gennesaret for its wonderful fruits, and says it is watered by a most fertile fountain which the people of the country call Capharnaum. In the water of this fountain the Coracinus is found (BJ, III, x, 8). Josephus therefore corroborates the Biblical data, and adds the information as to the fountain and the Coracinus fish. The fish however is found in other fountains near the lake, and is therefore no help toward identification.The two chief rivals for the honor of representing Capernaum are Tell Chum, a ruined site on the lake shore, nearly 2 1/2 miles West of the mouth o...</p>

First Theory: Crete:The country and people whence came the Philistines (Ge 10:14 = 1Ch 1:12 (here the clause &quot;whence went forth the Philistines&quot; should, probably come after Caphtorim); De 2:23; Jer 47:4; Am 9:7). Jer (loc. cit.) calls it an &quot;island&quot;; there is evidence of ancient connection between Crete and Philistia; and the Philistines are called Cherethites, which may mean Cretans (see CHERETHITES). These considerations have led many to identify Caphtor with the important island of Crete. It should be noted, however, that the word &#x27;i, used by Jeremiah, denotes not only &quot;isle,&quot; but also &quot;coastland.&quot;2. Second Theory: Phoenicia:Ebers (Aegypten und die Bucher Moses, 130 ff) thought that Caphtor represented the Egyptian Kaft-ur, holding that Kaft was the Egyptian name for the colonies of Phoenicians in the Delta, extended to cover the Phoenicians in the north and their colonies. Kaft-ur, therefore, would mean &quot;Greater Phoenicia.&quot; But the discovery of Kaptar among the names of countries conquered by Ptolemy Auletes in an inscription on the Temple of Kom Ombo is fatal to this theory.3. Third Theory: Cilicia:A third theory would identify Caphtor with the Kafto of the Egyptian inscriptions. As early as the time of Thotmes III the inhabitants of this land, the Kafti, are mentioned in the records. In the trilingual inscription of Canopus the name is rendered in Greek by Phoinike, &quot;Phoenicia.&quot; This seems to be an error, as the Kafti portrayed on the monuments have no features in common with the Semites. They certainly represent a western type. It is held that the Egyptian Kafto is a district in Asia Minor, probably Cilicia. The sea- pirates, the purasati, whom Rameses III subdued (circa 1200 BC), entered Syria from the north. The &quot;R&quot; in the name is the Egyptian equivalent of the Semitic &quot;L&quot;. Therefore Purasati = Pilishti, &quot;Philistines.&quot; And so it is proposed to identify Caphtor with Cilicia. A serious objection to this theory is the absence of the final &quot;r&quot; in Kafto. McCurdy&#x27;s suggestion (HDB) that it represents a Hebrew waw, written as a vowel-letter in an original Kafto, does not carry conviction.It is impossible to give a certain decision; but the balance of probability seems still inclined to the first theory.W.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kap-a-do&#x27;-shi-a (he Kappadokia): An extensive province in eastern Asia Minor, bounded by the Taurus mountains on the South, the Anti-Taurus and the Euphrates on the East, and, less definitely, by Pontus and Galatia on the North and West. Highest mountain, Argaeus, over 13,000 ft. above sea-level; chief rivers, the Pyramus now Jihan, Sarus now Sihon, and Halys now the Kuzul; most important cities, Caesarea Mazaca, Comana, Miletene now Malatia, and Tyana now Bor. At Malatia the country unrolls itself as a fertile plain; elsewhere the province is for the most part composed of billowy and rather barren uplands, and bleak mountain peaks and pastures.The Greek geographers called Cappodax the son of Ninyas, thereby tracing the origin of Cappadocian culture to Assyria. Cuneiform tablets from Kul Tepe (Kara Eyuk), deciphered by Professors Pinches and Sayce, show that in the era of Khammurabi (see HAMMURABI) this extensive ruin on the ox-bow of the Halys and near Caesarea Mazaca, was an outpost of the Assyr-Bah Empire. A Hittite civilization followed, from about 2000 BC onward. Malatia, Gurun, Tyana and other old sites contain important and undoubted Hittite remains, while sporadic examples of Hittite art, architecture and inscriptions are found in many places, and the number is being steadily increased by fresh discovery. After the Hittites fade from sight, following the fall of Carchemish, about 718 BC, Cappadocia emerges as a satrapy of Persia. At the time of Alexander the Great it received a top-dressing of Greek culture, and a line of native kings established an independent throne, which lasted until Cappadocia was incorporated in the Roman Empire, 17 AD. Nine rulers bore the name of Ariarathes (the Revised Version (British and American) Arathes) the founder of the dynasty, and two were named Ariobarzanes. One of these kings is referred to in 1 Macc 15:22. The history of this Cappadocian kingdom is involved, obscure and bloody.Pagan religion had a deep hold upon the population prior to the advent of Christianity. Comana was famous for its worship of the great goddess Ma, who was served, according to Strabo, by 6,000 priestesses, and only second to this was the worship paid to Zeus at Venasa.Representatives from Cappadocia were present at Pentecost (Ac 2:9), and Peter includes the converts in this province in the address of his letter (1Pe 1:1). Caesarea became one of the most important early centers of Christianity. Here the Armenian youth of noble blood, Krikore, or Gregory the Illuminator, was instructed in the faith to which he afterward won the formal assent of his whole nation. Here Basil governed the churches of his wide diocese and organized monasticism. His brother, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory Nazianzen, lived and labored not far away. Cappadocia passed with the rest of Asia Minor into the Byzantine Empire, but from its exposed position early fell under the domination of the Turks, having been conquered by the Seljukians in 1074.G.

Western Campaigns of Shalmaneser II, 860-825 BC:The captivity of the Northern Kingdom was the work of the great Assyrian power having its seat at Nineveh on the Tigris. The empire of Assyria, rounded nearly 2000 BC, had a long history behind it when its annals begin to take notice of the kingdom of Israel and Judah. The reign of Shalmaneser II (860-825 BC) marks the first contact between these powers. This is not the Shalmaneser mentioned in 2Ki 17 and 18, who is the fourth of the name and flourished more than a century later. Shalmaneser II was contemporary during his long reign with Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, Ahaziah and Joash, kings of Judah; with Ahab, Ahaziah, Jehoram and Jehu, kings of Israel; with Hazael and Benhadad II, kings of Syria at Damascus, and with Mesha, king of Moab. The Assyrian authorities for his reign are an inscription engraved by himself on the rocks of Armenia; the Black Obelisk brought by Layard from Nimroud, now in the British Museum; and the texts engraved on the bronze gates of Balawat, discovered by Hormuzd Rassam in 1878, and recognized as the swinging gates of Shalmaneser&#x27;s palace.

The Hebrew text in Ezekiel is dubious, but in Isaiah and Job &quot;caravan&quot; is undoubtedly a correct rendering of the Hebrew (compare also Ge 37:25). The inhabitants of Palestine were familiar with the caravans--the goods trains of the Semitic world--which traveled between BabyIon and Syria on the one hand to Arabia and on the other to Egypt. The main routes between these countries passed through Canaan. Isaiah refers to &quot;caravans of Jedanites&quot;--a trading Arabic tribe who conveyed their wares to Babylon. Job compares his would-be friends to a deceitful brook, full in the rainy season, but dry in summer, which entices caravans to turn aside from the main route in the hope of a plentiful supply of water, but which fails the thirsty travelers when they need it most.T.

The Assyrian form of the name is Kargamis or Gargamis, but its meaning is doubtful, the interpretation &quot;Fort of the god Chemosh&quot; having been suggested before it was known that the Assyrian-Babylon form of Chemosh was not Kamish or Gamish, but Kammusu (Kammosu). Systematic excavations on the site have apparently only just been made, those undertaken by Consul J. Henderson, after the death of G. Smith the Assyriologist, having been mainly devoted to the excavation of sculptures, etc. The site has vast walls and palace-mounds about. 8,000 ft. in circumference.1. Evidence of the City&#x27;s Early Existence:The earliest occurrence of the name is in an adjectival form, namely, Karkarnisu, &quot;Carchemishite,&quot; applied to a vase or measure of 200 qa, in a list of property at Sippar in the reign of Ammi-caduga (circa 1900 BC). Later on, the Egyptian poet known as Pentaur refers to the people of Carchemish (Qarqamesa) as forming, with the men of Arvad, Aleppo and Gozan, part of &quot;the host of the miserable king of the Hittites&quot; (Hattu-sil), who fought against Rameses II at the battle of Kadesh. The first Assyrian king to mention Carchemish is Tiglath-pileser I (circa 1268 BC), who states that he plundered &quot;from the neighborhood of the land of Suhu (the Shuhites) as far as Carchemish of the land of Hattu&quot; in one day.2. Its Later History:Later, the city attracted the attention of the Assyrian king Assur-nacir-apli, who started on the 8th of Iyyar, about the year 870 BC, to the conquest of the district, and received tribute from the son of Bit-Bahiani; and, a little later, from Sangara of Carchemish, who is described as king of the Hittites. This tribute consisted of 20 talents of silver, various objects of gold, 100 talents of copper, 250 talents of iron, furniture, chariots and horses--an enormous treasure. Shalmaneser II, son of Assur-nacir-apli, also took tribute from the king of Carchemish here referred to. On the first occasion when the two monarchs met, Sangara was in alliance with the Sam&#x27;alians, Patinians, and Til- Bursip. After the capture of Sazabe (858 BC), a strong city of Sangara of Carchemish, all the opposing princes submitted. The tribute paid by the Hittite king on this occasion is depicted on strip F of the bronze coverings of the gates of Balawat, which has four representations of the place--two in the upper and two in the lower row of reliefs. The Kurkh monolith states that the tribute consisted of &quot;2 talents of gold, 70 talents of silver, 80 talents of bronze, 100 talents of iron, 30 talents of purple stuff, 500 weapons, his daughter with a dowry, and 100 daughters of his great men, 500 oxen, and 5,000 sheep.&quot; A yearly tax was also imposed. The reliefs show two long trains of tribute-bearers, that in the lower row escorting the princess, who,...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kar, kar&#x27;-fool-ness, kar&#x27;-fool: The English word &quot;care&quot; has such a variety of meanings, and so many Hebrew and Greek words in the Bible are translated by this English expression and its compounds, that it is difficult to organize them into a single brief article. We may do so, however, by remembering that into our word are really woven two strands, one Teutonic and one Latin. The former element implies a measure of trouble or sorrow, as the pain from a blow, a throb, a distress in the mind; the latter, from Latin cura, implies a stretching forward, attention to some person or thing. We can often discern these two senses side by side in the Bible, and sometimes they almost run into one another. This is so especially in the King James Version. We can treat the subject best by keeping separate, as far as possible, these two senses.I. In the Sense of Anxiety, Solicitude.1. Substantives:In the Old Testament several words are translated &quot;care&quot; in this sense. &quot;Thy father hath left off caring for the asses,&quot; concern about them literally, &quot;matters of the asses&quot; (dibhre, 1Sa 10:2). &quot;They shall eat bread by weight, and with care&quot; (de&#x27;-aghah, &quot;carefulness&quot; the Revised Version (British and American); &quot;fearfulness&quot; the American Standard Revised Version, Eze 4:16). The same word is rendered carefulness (the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American); &quot;fearfulness,&quot; the American Standard Revised Version, Eze 12:18-19); and &quot;fear&quot; (King James Version; &quot;carefulness,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version, Jos 22:24). Again, &quot;heaviness&quot; (the Kings James Version; the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version), but &quot;care&quot; (the Revised Version, margin and the American Revised Version, margin, Pr 12:25). Once more, &quot;sorrow&quot; (the King James Version, the Revised with Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version), but &quot;care&quot; (the Revised Version, margin and the American Revised Version, margin, Jer 49:23). There is also the word charadhah &quot;trembling,&quot; &quot;fear,&quot; &quot;anxiety.&quot; It is rendered &quot;trembling&quot; (Ge 27:33 the King James Version). But &quot;thou hast been careful for us all this care&quot; (&quot;showed us all this reverence,&quot; the Revised Version, margin, the American Revised Version, margin, 2Ki 4:13). In the New Testament, &quot;care,&quot; in the sense of anxiety, is the meaning given to merimna, the condition of being drawn mentally in different directions, distraction of mind. &quot;Care of the world&quot; (Mt 13:22; Mr 4:19; Lu 8:14, &quot;cares of this life,&quot; Lu 21:34); &quot;care of all the churches&quot; (2Co 11:28) (&quot;anxiety,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version); &quot;casting all your care upon him&quot; (&quot;anxiety,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American), the American Standard Revised Version, 1Pe 5:7).

Several words in the Hebrew and Greek are thus rendered in the English versions &quot;Anxiously&quot; is the thought in &quot;The inhabitants of Maroth waited carefully for good&quot; (chalah, &quot;to be in pain,&quot; &quot;was grieved&quot; King James Version margin, &quot;waiteth anxiously&quot; the Revised Version (British and American), the American Standard Revised Version, &quot;is in travail&quot; the Revised Version, margin, the American Revised Version, margin, Mic 1:12).In the sense of attentively, the Hebrew emphatic expression, the infinite absolute with the finite verb is rendered &quot;carefully&quot; in, &quot;Thou shalt carefully hearken&quot; (literally &quot;hearing, thou shalt hear,&quot; &quot;diligently hearken&quot; the Revised Version (British and American), the American Standard Revised Version, De 15:5).

Its borders, however, like those of most of the ancient countries of Asia Minor, were never definitely fixed; hence, the difficulty presented by the study of the political divisions. The general surface of the country is rugged, consisting of mountainous ridges running across it, and terminating as promontories jutting into the sea. Its history consists chiefly of that of its practically independent cities of which Miletus (Ac 20:15-20) and Cnidus (Ac 27:7) are the chief. For some time previous to 168 BC it had lost its independence, and belonged to the island of Rhodes, but in that year Rome made it again free. According to 1 Macc 15:23, Caria was one of several places to which the Roman senate in 139-138 BC sent letters in favor of the Jews, a fact showing that its population was mixed. Its coast cities, however, were peopled chiefly by Greeks. In 129 BC Caria became a part of the Roman province of Asia, and from that date its history coincides with that of the province. Though Paul and others of the apostles traversed Caria in their missionary journeys, only its cities are mentioned by name in that connection.E. J. Banks</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(1) A beautifully wooded mountain range running for about 13 miles in a south-easterly direction from the promontory which drops on the shore of the Mediterranean near Haifa, at the southern extremity of the plain of Acre, to the height of el-Machraqah which overlooks the plain of Esdraelon. On the top of the promontory, at a height of 500 ft. the monastery of Elias stands. From this point there is a gradual ascent until the greatest height is reached at Esfiyeh (1,742 ft.), the peak at el-Machraqah being only some 55 ft. lower. The mountain--usually named with the article, &quot;the Carmel&quot;--still justifies its name, &quot;the garden with fruit trees.&quot; The steep slopes on the North and East, indeed, afford little scope for cultivation, although trees and brushwood grow abundantly. But to the South and West the mountain falls away to the sea and the plain in a series of long, fertile valleys, where the &quot;excellency&quot; of Carmel finds full illustration today. There are a few springs of good water; but the main supply is furnished by the winter rains, which are caught and stored in great cisterns. The villages on the slopes have a look of prosperity not too often seen in Syria, the rich soil amply rewarding the toil of the husbandmen. Oak and pine, myrtle and honeysuckle, box and laurel flourish; the sheen of fruitful olives fills many a hollow; and in the time of flowers Carmel is beautiful in a garment of many colors. Evidences of the ancient husbandry which made it famous are found in the cisterns, and the oil and wine presses cut in the surface of the rock. There is probably a reference to the vine culture here in 2Ch 26:10. In the figurative language of Scripture it appears as the symbol of beauty (So 7:5), of fruitfulness (Isa 35:2), of majesty (Jer 46:18), of prosperous and happy life (Jer 50:19). The languishing of Carmel betokens the vengeance of God upon the land (Na 1:4); and her decay, utter desolation (Am 1:2; Isa 33:9).Asylum and Sanctuary:Roughly triangular in form, with plains stretching from its base on each of the three sides, the mountain, with its majestic form and massive bulk, is visible from afar. Its position deprived it of any great value for military purposes. It commanded none of the great highways followed by armies: the passes between Esdraelon and Sharon, to the East of Carmel, furnishing the most convenient paths. But the mountain beckoned the fugitive from afar, and in all ages has offered asylum to the hunted in its caves and wooded glens. Also its remote heights with their spacious outlook over land and sea; its sheltered nooks and embowering groves have been scenes of worship from old time. Here stood an ancient altar of Yahweh (1Ki 18:30). We may assume that there was also a sanctuary of Baal, since the worshippers of these deities chose the place as common ground for the great trim (1Ki 18). The scene is traditionally located at el-Machraqah, &quot;the place of burnt sacrifice,&quot; which is still held sacred by the Druzes. A Latin c...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(1) A son of Reuben who came to Egypt with Jacob (Ge 46:9; Ex 6:14; 1Ch 5:3). Also the name of a family of which Carmi was the head (Nu 26:6).(2) A Judahite (1Ch 2:7), son of Zabdi, according to Jos 7:1, and father of Achan, who is given the name of &quot;Achar&quot; in 1Ch 2:7. This last form &quot;Achar&quot; is preferred to the usual &quot;Achan&quot; in order to bring out the play on the Hebrew word for &quot;troubler.&quot; The Hebrew runs `akhar `okher yisra&#x27;el, &quot;Achar, the troubler of Israel.&quot; As regards the phrase &quot;the sons of Carmi&quot; (1Ch 2:7), Carmi is probably to be taken as the son of Zimri (= Zabdi, Jos 7:1). The Targum, however, has &quot;Carmi who is Zimri.&quot; The Septuagint identifies Zimri and Zabdi.(3) In 1Ch 4:1, Carmi, elsewhere called son of Zabdi or Zimri, is made son of Judah; but Wellhausen correctly changes &quot;Carmi&quot; to &quot;Chelubai&quot; (compare 1Ch 2:9).Horace J.

It is frequently mentioned by the ancient writers, among others by Strabo and Arrian, who describe the inhabitants as closely resembling the Medians and Persians in manners and customs. In the passage cited they are intended to denote a fierce and warlike people, being described as &quot;raging in wrath as wild boars of the wood&quot; and associated with the &quot;dragons of Arabia.&quot;J.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kar&#x27;-nal: In the Old Testament there is an expression which indicates sexual intercourse shikhebhath zera`, &quot;lying of seed,&quot; (Le 18:20; 19:20; Nu 5:13). In the New Testament the words rendered &quot;carnal&quot; are derived from sarks, &quot;flesh.&quot; This refers to the flesh as opposed to the pneuma, &quot;spirit,&quot; and denotes, in an ethical sense, mere human nature, the lower side of man as apart from the Divine influence, and therefore estranged from God and prone to sin; whatever in the soul is weak and tends toward ungodliness (see FLESH). Thus one may be carnal (sarkinos), sold under sin (Ro 7:14). Christians may be carnal (sarkinos, 1Co 3:1; sarkikos, 1Co 3:3); the lower side of their being is dominant and not the spirit, hence, they fall into sins of envy and strife. The weapons of the Christian warfare are not carnal, not merely human (of the flesh the Revised Version (British and American), the American Standard Revised Version), but spiritual (2Co 10:4); &quot;not after the law of a carnal commandment&quot; (Hebrews 7:16); &quot;The carnal mind is enmity against God&quot; (&quot;mind of the flesh&quot; the Revised Version (British and American), the American Standard Revised Version, Ro 8:7). So, &quot;to be carnally minded is death&quot; (&quot;mind of the flesh&quot; the Revised Version (British and American), the American Standard Revised Version, Ro 8:6). There are &quot;carnal ordinances,&quot; in contrast to the spiritual ones of the gospel (Hebrews 9:10); &quot;Minister unto them in carnal things,&quot; those that pertain to the body in contrast to spiritual things (Ro 15:27; 1Co 9:11). The same expressions are elsewhere rendered &quot;fleshly&quot; (2Co 1:12; 3:3 the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;hearts of flesh&quot;; 1Pe 2:11).Is there any difference between sarkinos and sarkikos? The former more definitely denotes the material of which an object is made. It may express with emphasis the idea of sarkikos, the spiritual given up as it were to the flesh.See MAN (THE NATURAL).G.

The name, common enough in Paul&#x27;s day, signifies &quot;fruit&quot; (Young) or &quot;wrist&quot; (Davis). The words indicate that Paul must have been very well acquainted with the family of Carpus. He was presumably one of his converts; and the apostle must have lodged with him and also have had considerable confidence in him, since he committed to his care not only the comparatively valueless &quot;cloak,&quot; but especially the priceless &quot;books and parchments.&quot; It is idle to attempt to find out the identity of Carpus, but one cannot help wondering what were the contents of these books and parchments for which the apostle longed in his bitter second imprisonment.Henry E.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kart (`aghalah): The Hebrew word has been translated in some passages &quot;cart,&quot; and in others &quot;wagon.&quot; In one verse only has it been translated &quot;chariot.&quot; The context of the various passages indicates that a distinction was made between vehicles which were used for carrying baggage or produce and those used for carrying riders (chariots), although in their primitive form of construction they were much the same (compare English &quot;cart&quot; and &quot;carriage&quot;).Carts, like &quot;chariots&quot; (which see), were of Assyrian origin. They were early carried to Egypt where the flat nature of the country readily led to their adoption. From Egypt they gradually found their way among the people of the Palestinian plains. In the hills of Judea and Central Palestine, except where highways were built (1Sa 6:12), the nature of the country prevented the use of wheeled vehicles. 1Sa 6:7,8,10,11,14 show that the people of the plains used carts. The men of Kiriath-jearim found it easier to carry the ark (1Sa 7:1). Their attempt to use a cart later (2Sa 6:3,1; 1Ch 13:7) proved disastrous and they abandoned it for a safer way (2Sa 6:13).That carts were used at a very early date is indicated by Nu 7:3,7,8. That these vehicles were not the common mode of conveyance in Palestine is shown in Ge 45. Pharaoh commanded that Joseph&#x27;s brethren should return to their father with their beasts of burden (Gen 45:21) and take with them Egyptian wagons (Gen 45:19,21; 46:6) for bringing back their father and their families. The very unusual sight of the wagons was proof to Jacob of Joseph&#x27;s existence (Gen 45:27).Bible descriptions and ancient Babylonian and Egyptian pictures indicate that the cart was usually two-wheeled and drawn by two oxen.With the Arabian conquests and subsequent ruin of the roads wheeled vehicles disappeared from Syria and Palestine. History is again repeating itself. The Circassians, whom the Turkish government has settled near Caesarea, Jerash (Gerasa) and Amman (Philadelphia), have introduced a crude cart which must be similar to that used in Old Testament times. The two wheels are of solid wood. A straight shaft is joined to the wooden axle, and to this a yoke of oxen is attached. On the Philistian plains may be seen carts of present-day Egyptian origin but of a pattern many centuries old. With the establishment of government roads during the last 50 years, European vehicles of all descriptions are fast coming into the country.One figurative reference is made to the cart (Isa 5:18), but its meaning is obscure.James A.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">karv&#x27;-ing: Carving, or engraving, was extensively used among the peoples of Bible lands. There were no materials used in the arts which were not subjected to the graver&#x27;s skill. Carved objects of wood, stone, ivory, clay, bronze, gold, silver and glass discovered today show how skillful the ancient carvers were. Carving was principally done in bas- relief, although Ex 28:11 shows that incised lines were also used. The signets and scarabs are examples of this class of carving. Several Hebrew words have been translated &quot;carved&quot; in the King James Version. Pecel or pecil is found in Jud 18:18; 2Ch 33:7,22; 34:3,1; chaqah in 1Ki 6:35. The translation &quot;graven&quot; appears in the Revised Version (British and American) of all these passages. In 1Ki 6:29,32,35, qala appears; in 1Ki 6:18,32, miqla`ath; in 1Ki 6:29 and Ps 74:6, pittuach; in Ex 31:5; 35:33, charosheth (see CARPENTER); chaTubhah in Pr 7:16 is better translated &quot;striped&quot; as in the Revised Version (British and American).

It is a fragrant, aromatic bark and was probably used in a powdered form. Both as an ingredient in unguents and as one of the perfumes at funerals, cassia, like cinnamon, was much used by the Romans. The cassia of Scripture must be clearly distinguished from the entirely distinct Cassia lanceolata and C. obovata which yield the familiar senna.

Thus, in Lu 1:29 &quot;cast in her mind&quot; means &quot;considered&quot; (dielogizeto); &quot;cast reproach&quot; for Greek oneidizon, &quot;reproached&quot; (Mt 27:44); &quot;casting down&quot; for kathaireo, &quot;demolishing&quot; (2Co 10:4); &quot;casting all anxiety upon&quot; (1Pe 5:7), a still stronger term, as in Lu 17:2 the King James Version; Ac 27:19. As a fundamental Greek word, it is compounded with many prepositions, &quot;about,&quot; &quot;away,&quot; &quot;down,&quot; &quot;forth,&quot; &quot;in,&quot; &quot;into,&quot; &quot;off,&quot; &quot;out,&quot; &quot;up,&quot; &quot;upon.&quot; &quot;Cast down&quot; in 2Co 4:9 the King James Version is used in a military sense of one prostrated, but not killed in battle.

The sialrum was a loop-shaped metal frame through which were passed loose rods at the ends of which were rings. The instrument was held by a long handle and was rattled during songs and dances.

In the Old Testament he teaches them the rudiments of Old Testament truth; in the New Testament he teaches the principles of the Christian faith. A catechumen, one whom the catechist instructs or catechizes, in preparation for the ceremony of baptism.The words are derived from katechein, meaning &quot;to give a sound,&quot; &quot;to answer,&quot; &quot;to echo.&quot; Classically it was used of the sounding down of rushing water, of the falling of music from a ship to the sea. Then it came to signify the sounding down of words of command or instruction. The preposition kata strengthens the meaning, bringing out more emphatically the back or return sound, the echo, the answer. So it came to mean familiar verbal instruction, a free informal discussion between teacher and pupil. Luke informs Theophilus (Lu 1:4) that he intends to give him a succinct and orderly account of those things which he had previously received by word of mouth (peri hon katechethes). See also the Greek in Ac 18:25 and Ac 21:21; Ro 2:18; 1Co 14:19; Ga 6:6. In all these passages the Greek verb is &quot;catechised.&quot;We do not find in the New Testament an organized catechumenate, such as we find in the 3rd and 4th centuries. The apostles preached mainly to synagogue-instructed Jews who were familiar with the law and the prophets and the Psalms, or to Gentiles who had, learned from the Jews and had become &quot;proselytes&quot; (which see). The first apostolic preaching and teaching was to convince the hearers that Jesus was the promised Messiah, the Saviour of the world. As believers multiplied, the contrast between them and those who rejected the teaching became more and more marked. Opposition, scorn and persecution became more bold and bitter. The Christians were compelled to set forth and defend their beliefs more clearly. They had to meet and answer keen and persistent objections. And so the necessity for clear, systematic and organized teaching grew more and more into the form of an ordered catechumenate. The Apostolic Constitutions, from the latter part of the 3rd century, show the institution in a fair state of development. A Jew, pagan, or heretic of good moral standing, upon application to the deacon, presbyter, or bishop, was admitted into the state of catechumen by the sign of the cross and the imposition of hands (Schaff-Herzog, under the word).The basis for the Christian catechumenate we find in the great commission (Mt 28:19,20). The aim of this commission was to make disciples, i.e. believing followers. The means for this discipling are baptizing and teaching. The result of using the means is that those who have become disciples are to observe all things whatsoever Christ has commanded.Jesus Himself at twelve years of age had become a child of the law, a catechumen. He increased in wisdom and learned obedience. He became the great Catechist inst...</p>

          <h3 style="font-family:var(--font-heading);color:var(--leather-dark);margin:0 0 0.5rem;">CATHOLIC EPISTLES</h3>
          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kath&#x27;-o-lik (epistolai katholikai): In distinction from the apostolic or Pauline epistles which were addressed to individual churches or persons, the term &quot;catholic,&quot; in the sense of universal or general, was applied by Origen and the other church Fathers to the seven epistles written by James, Peter, John and Jude. As early as the 3rd century it came to be used in the sense of &quot;encyclical,&quot; &quot;since,&quot; as Theodoret says, &quot;they are not addressed to single churches, but generally (katholou) to the faithful, whether to the Jews of the Dispersion, as Peter writes, or even to all who are living as Christians under the same faith.&quot; Three other explanations of the term have been given, namely,(1) that it was intended to indicate a common apostolic authorship (only a few support this view);(2) that it signifies that the seven epistles were universally received as genuine;(3) that it refers to the catholicity of their doctrine, i.e. orthodox and authoritative versus heretical epistles whose teachings were in harmony with Christian truth. By some misconception of the word &quot;catholic&quot; the Western Church interpreted it as signifying &quot;canonical&quot; and sometimes called these epistles epistolae canonicae. That it was originally used in the sense of &quot;general&quot; epistles is now commonly received.This is evident from their form of address. James wrote to all Jews, &quot;of the Dispersion,&quot; who had embraced the Christian faith. In his first epistle Peter addressed the same Christians, including also Gentileconverts, resident in five provinces of Asia Minor: &quot;elect who axe sojourners of the Dispersion.&quot; His second epistle is to all Christians everywhere. John&#x27;s first letter was evidently written to a cycle of churches and intended for universal use. Jude also had in mind all Christians when he said &quot;to them that are called beloved in God,&quot; etc. The seeming exceptions are 2 and 3 Jn, addressed to individuals, but included with the catholic epistles as properly belonging with John&#x27;s first epistle and of value to the general reader. The character and contents of these seven epistles are treated under their various heads. The letters of James and Jude belong to the Judaic school of Christianity; those of Peter to a broad and non-partisan type of faith that both includes and mediates between the Judaists and Paulinists. John&#x27;s letters were written after the internal doctrinal controversies of the church had ceased, and the pressure of opposition and error from without tended to unite his &quot;little children&quot; in a new community of love and spiritual life.Dwight M.

It is evident that neat cattle were possessed in abundance by the patriarchs and later Israelites, which is fax from being the case in Palestine at the present day. The Bedouin usually have no cattle. The fellachin in most parts of the country keep them in small numbers, mostly for plowing, and but little for milk or for slaughtering. Travelers in the Holy Land realize that goat&#x27;s milk is in most places easier to obtain than cow&#x27;s milk. The commonest cattle of the fellachin are a small black breed. In the vicinity of Damascus are many large, fine milch cattle which furnish the delicious milk and cream of the Damascus bazaars. For some reason, probably because they are not confined and highly fed, the bulls of Palestine are meek creatures as compared with their European or American fellows.In English Versions of the Bible the word &quot;cattle&quot; is more often used in a wide sense to include sheep and goats than to denote merely neat cattle. In fact, baqar, which distinctively denotes neat cattle, is often rendered &quot;herds,&quot; as tso&#x27;n, literally &quot;sheep,&quot; is in a large number of instances translated &quot;flocks.&quot; A good illustration is found in Ge 32:7: &quot;Then Jacob .... divided the, people (`am) that were with him, and the flocks (tso&#x27;n), and the herds (baqar), and the camels (gemallim), into two companies (machanoth).&quot; For the last word the King James Version has &quot;drove&quot; in Ge 33:8, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;company.&quot; Next to tso&#x27;n, the word most commonly rendered &quot;flock&quot; in English Versions of the Bible is `edher, from root &quot;to arrange,&quot; &quot;to set in order.&quot; `Edher is rendered &quot;herd&quot; in Pr 27:23, and in Joe 1:18 it occurs twice, being rendered &quot;herds of cattle,&quot; `edhre baqar, and &quot;flocks of sheep,&quot; `edhre ha-tso&#x27;n. Miqneh is rendered &quot;flock&quot; in Nu 32:26, &quot;herd&quot; in Ge 47:18, and &quot;cattle&quot; in a large number of passages.

Its elevation to the rank of a bishopric in Byzantine times must have been due to its association with the voyage of Paul.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kav ([me`arah] (compare Arabic magharah), chor (Job 30:6 the King James Version), mechilloth (Isa 2:19); ope (Hebrews 11:38), spelaion (Joh 11:38); chor, more often rendered &quot;hole,&quot; is akin to Arabic khaur, &quot;gulf&quot; or &quot;inlet,&quot; but is also related to me`arah (compare also Arabic ghaur &quot;low-land,&quot; especially of the Jordan valley and Dead Sea). Mechilloth (root, chalal, &quot;to pierce&quot; (compare Arabic khall, &quot;to pierce&quot;)) occurs only in Isa 2:19, where the King James Version has &quot;caves&quot; and translates me`aroth in the same verse by &quot;holes.&quot; In the Revised Version (British and American) these words are very properly changed about. Spelaion is a common Greek word for &quot;cave&quot;; ope means rather &quot;hole&quot;): In Palestine as in other limestone countries, caves are of frequent occurrence, and not a few of large size are known. Water from the rain and snow, seeping down through cracks, enlarges the passages through which it goes by dissolving away the substance of the rock. Just as upon the surface of the land the trickling streams unite to form brooks and rivers, so many subterranean streams may come together in a spacious channel, and may issue upon the surface as a bold spring. The cave of the Dog River near Beirut and that of &#x27;Afqa (perhaps Aphek (Jos 13:4)) in Lebanon are excellent examples of this. Not infrequently after forming a cave the stream of water may find some lower outlet by a different route, leaving its former course dry. In some cases the hinder part of the roof of the cave may fall in, leaving the front part standing as a natural bridge. Numerous shallow caves, especially in the faces of cliffs, are formed not by seeping water, but by atmospheric erosion, a portion of a relatively soft stratum of rock being hollowed out, while harder strata above and below it are but little worn away. Many of the hermits&#x27; caves originated in this way and were artificially enlarged and walled up at the mouth. The principal caves mentioned in the Bible are those of MACHPELAH, MAKKEDAH and ADULLAM (which see).See DEN.Alfred Ely Day</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ses: A remarkable array of 20 Hebrew and 6 Greek words is so translated. In the King James Version 15 of the former and 3 of the latter are used only once with this rendering. The originals most frequently in use are chadhal, &quot;to leave off&quot;; shabhath &quot;to rest from&quot; (labor); pauomai, &quot;to make to cease.&quot; Few words illustrate better the fertility of the Hebrew in expressing limitless shades of meaning, impoverished by the use of one English word. This extensive variety is, however, well expressed by &quot;cease&quot;: i.e. stop, come to an end, e.g. ceasing of tears (Jer 14:17); work (Ezr 4:24); grinders (Ec 12:3); thunder (Ex 9:29); the wicked (Job 3:17); anger (Ps 37:8). The significance of shabhath lies in its being the Hebrew for Sabbath, implying complete cessation: as of manna (Jos 5:12); strife and ignominy (Pr 22:10); occurs with negative to show the ceaseless Providence of God in Nature: &quot;summer and winter .... shall not c.&quot; (Ge 8:22). In the New Testament it illustrates Christ&#x27;s power over Nature; wind and raging sea ceased (Lu 8:24); over a sinner&#x27;s heart: &quot;not ceased to kiss my feet&quot; (dialeipo) (Lu 7:45); devotion of the early disciples, &quot;ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus as the Christ&quot; (Ac 5:42); the eternity and blessedness of the believer&#x27;s sabbatic rest (apoleipo) (Hebrews 4:10 the King James Version).Dwight M.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">se&#x27;-dar, se&#x27;-der (&#x27;erez, from Hebrew root meaning &quot;to be firm&quot;; kedros): The &#x27;erez was in almost all the Old Testament references the true cedar, Cedrus libani, but the name may have been applied in a loose way to allied trees, such as junipers and pines. In Nu 24:6--&quot;as cedar-trees beside the waters&quot;--the reference must, as is most probable, be purely poetical (see ALOES) or the &#x27;arazim must signify some other kind of tree which flourishes beside water.1. Cedar for Ritual Cleansing:Cedar is twice mentioned as a substance for ritual cleansing. In Le 14:4 the cleansed leper was sprinkled with the blood of a &quot;clean bird&quot; into which had been put &quot;cedar- wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.&quot; In Nu 19:6 &quot;cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet&quot; were to be cast into the holocaust of the red heifer. (For the symbolical meaning see CLEAN.) Here it is very generally considered that the cedar could not have been the wood of Cedrus libani, which so far as we know never grew in the wilderness, but that of some species of juniper--according to Post, Juniperis phoenicea, which may still be found in the wilderness of Edom.2. Cedar Trees in the Old Testament:Cedar trees are everywhere mentioned with admiration in the Old Testament. Solomon made the cedar the first of trees (1Ki 4:33). They are the &quot;glory of Lebanon&quot; (Isa 35:2; 60:13). The most boastful threat of Sennacherib was that he would cut down the tall cedars of Lebanon (Isa 37:24). They were strong, as is implied in--  &quot;The voice of Yahweh is powerful; .... The voice of Yahweh breaketh the cedars; Yea, Yahweh breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon&quot; (Ps 29:4,5).  The cedars are tall--&quot;whose height was like the height of the cedars&quot;--(Am 2:9; 2Ki 19:23); majestic (2Ki 14:9), and excellent (So 5:15). The Assyrian power is compared to--&quot;a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a forest-like shade, an high stature; and its top was among the thick boughs .... its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field; and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long&quot; (Eze 31:3-5). They are in particular God&#x27;s trees--  &quot;The trees of Yahweh are filled with moisture, The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted&quot; (Ps 104:16).  Doubtless as a reminiscence of this the Syrians today call the cedar `ars er rubb, &quot;the cedar of the Lord.&quot; The growth of the cedar is typical of that of the righteous man (Ps 92:12).That cedars were once very abundant in the Lebanon is evident (1Ki 6:9-18; 10:27). What they contributed to the glory and beauty of that district may be seen in Zec 11:1-2:  &quot;Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. Wail, O fir-tree, for the cedar is fallen, because the glorious (Revised Version margin) ones are destroyed: Wail, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest is come down.&quot;  3. Cedar Timber:The wood of the cedar has always been highly prized--much more so than the sycamore (1Ki 10:27; Isa 9:10). David had a house of cedar built for him by Hiram, king of Tyre (2Sa 5:11)...</p>

It comes from the root caphan, meaning &quot;to cover.&quot; It has its common meaning of the upper surface of a room; there is, however, some doubt of the textual Ceiled is found in 2Ch 3:5 ((chippah); Jer 22:14; Hag 1:4 (caphan in both); Eze 41:16 (sachiph)), the text of the last passage being doubtful. In none of these cases does &quot;ceiled&quot; refer to the upper surface of a room, but to the covering or paneling of the inner walls of a house with cedar or other costly wood. This is in accordance with a common early use of the English word, no longer frequent.George Ricker Berry</p>

It is an onomatopoetic word meaning &quot;to give a clear sharp sound,&quot; as word in vocal rejoicing, celebration. Its equivalent in Ethiopic is ellell, German hallen, English halloo, and appears in the great choral word Hallelujah of the Hebrew religion. Passing into Christian use it has become the term most expressive of majestic praise. Psalms 113-118 and 136 are called Hallel psalms. Found in Hezekiah&#x27;s psalm of praise for his miraculous recovery: &quot;Death cannot celebrate thee&quot; (Isa 38:18). chaghagh, root meaning &quot;to move in a circle&quot; hence, &quot;to keep a festival&quot; by sacred leaping and dancing; &quot;celebrate (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;keep&quot;) a feast&quot; (Le 23:41); shabhath, &quot;to rest,&quot; i.e. keep or observe a holy day; &quot;celebrate (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;keep&quot;) your sabbath&quot; (Le 23:32).Dwight M.

Light is thrown on its meaning by the rendering of the same Greek original as &quot;heavenly places&quot; (Eph 1:3,20; 2:6; 3:10); &quot;heavenly&quot; (1Co 15:48). Hence, &quot;celestial&quot; as used by Paul indicates the soul&#x27;s continued life beyond the grave, the spiritual body of the redeemed in heaven, who, in Christ, have put on immortality.Dwight M.

Etymologically the Greek word means &quot;a covered place,&quot; and in classical Greek its usage includes vaults and crypts as well as cellars. It seems evident that it was only the larger houses in Palestine in which cellars were used with any frequency. It is shown by the excavations that in rebuilding a town which was in ruins the old houses were sometimes utilized as cellars for the new. &#x27;otsar, is rendered cellar only in 1Ch 27:27 f.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">sen&#x27;-ser: In the King James Version censer is used as a translation of two Hebrew words, namely, machtah, and miqTereth. The former word is generally rendered &quot;censer,&quot; sometimes &quot;firepan,&quot; and in three cases (Ex 25:38; 37:23; Nu 4:9) &quot;snuffdish&quot; It denoted a bowl-shaped vessel used for different purposes, namely,(1) a censer, in which incense was burnt (Le 10:1);(2) a firepan, made of bronze, used in connection with the altar of burnt offering (Ex 27:3);(3) a snuffdish, i.e. a receptacle to hold pieces of burnt lamp-wick removed by the tongs or snuffers (Ex 25:38).Probably in all these cases the same kind of vessel was meant, namely, a bowl-shaped utensil with a handle, not unlike a saucepan. The other Hebrew word (derived from the same root as the word for &quot;incense&quot;) denoted a vessel for conveying incense (Eze 8:11; 2Ch 26:19). The Greek word thumiaterion, by which the Septuagint rendered miqTereth, is used also in Hebrews 9:4, where the King James Version gives &quot;censer,&quot; but the American Standard Revised Version is probably more correct, namely, &quot;altar of incense&quot; (see Commentaries under the word). Compare also Re 8:3,1, where libanotos, properly the adjective of &quot;frankincense,&quot; is translated &quot;censer.&quot;T. Lewis</p>

Matthew and Luke use the Greek word while Mark prefers the Latin form, as he does in the case of other words, seeing that he wrote primarily for Roman readers. The number of centurions in a legion was 60, that being at all epochs the number of centuries, although the number varied in the cohort or speira. The ordinary duties of the centurion were to drill his men, inspect their arms, food and clothing, and to command them in the camp and in the field. Centurions were sometimes employed on detached service the conditions of which in the provinces are somewhat obscure. Men like Cornelius and Julius (Ac 10:1; 27:1) may have been separated from the legion to which they properly belonged for the discharge of special duties. They and other centurions mentioned in the Gospels and the Ac (Mt 8:5; Mr 15:39,44,45; Lu 23:47) are represented by the sacred writers in a favorable light.See AUGUSTAN BAND.T. Nicol.</p>

Such usage occurs in Ge 18:10; Jos 9:24; Le 5:19; 24:16; 1Sa 20:3 the King James Version; 1Ki 2:37; Jer 26:15; 36:29; 42:19,22; 44:17.(3) The word &quot;certain&quot; is also made auxiliary to bring out the force of such expressions as the Hebrew yatsabh, &quot;to be firm,&quot; as in Da 2:8; also in the New Testament, of the verb astatein as in 1Co 4:11, &quot;have no certain dwelling-place.&quot;(4) Mention might be made also of &quot;certain&quot; as the rendering of sundry words, as &#x27;akh, in La 2:16; ki, in Ex 3:12; and ontos, in Lu 23:47, all being expressions for what is sure, beyond doubt.W.

Compare &quot;chashish,&quot; an Arabic word which, as commonly used, denotes grass either standing or cut, green or dry, although, strictly speaking, dry or cut grass alone. In the Revised Version (British and American) Isa 5:24 the translation is &quot;dry grass.&quot;(3) tebhen, is translated &quot;chaff&quot; in the King James Version (Jer 23:28). The same word is rendered &quot;straw&quot; in the Revised Version (British and American) (compare Arabic tibn).(4) &#x27;ur, a Chaldaic word, occurs in Da 2:35.In the New Testament achuron, is found in Mt 3:12 and Lu 3:17.In the process of winnowing, as it has been carried on in the East for thousands of years, the grain is tossed into the air so that the wind may cause a separation of chaff and straw. The light husks from the wheat and fine particles of straw are dispersed by the wind in the form of a fine dust; the heavier straw which has been broken into short pieces by the threshing process falls near at hand on the edge of the threshing-floor, while the grain falls back upon the pile. In Syria and Palestine, that which falls near at hand as cut straw is called tibn. This word occurs in the Arabic translation of Mt 3:12 and Lu 3:17. This straw is ordinarily saved and fed as &quot;roughage&quot; to the animals. It could easily be gathered and burned, as indicated in the above-mentioned verses, while the chaff is blown away beyond recovery, a strong figure to depict complete annihilation (Job 21:18; Isa 29:5; 41:16; Ho 13:3, Da 2:35).See AGRICULTURE; STRAW; WINNOWING.JAMES A.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">chan, chanz: Chains were used by the Hebrews:(1) As ornaments: &#x27;ets`adhah, neTiphah, `anaq, rabhidh, sharsherah, rattoq. As ornaments for the person they were worn about the ankles (Nu 31:50; Isa 3:20) and about the neck (So 4:9; Eze 16:11). They were used as ornaments for the ephod and breastplate of the high priest (Ex 28:14; 39:15). These chains were of pure gold. Solomon placed chains before the oracle in the temple (1Ki 6:21), and these were also of pure gold. They were used as ornaments for graven images (Isa 40:19) and around the necks of prized animals. This was true of the camels taken from the Midianites by Gideon (Jud 8:21,26).(2) As marks of distinction: rabhidh, hamunekh (hamnikh): That seems to be true of the chain which Pharaoh placed about the neck of Joseph (Ge 41:42), and of the one which the king of Babylon promised to the wise men (Da 5:7).(3) As means of confining prisoners: nechosheth; halusis: A number of passages that were translated &quot;chains&quot; in the King James Version are translated &quot;fetters&quot; in the Revised Version (British and American) (see Jud 16:21; 2Sa 3:34). Among the Romans the prisoner was chained to one or two guards (Ac 12:6,7; 21:33; Eph 6:20; 2Ti 1:16). These chains were perhaps made of copper or an alloy of copper and tin.(4) As a figurative expression: `anaq. The Psalmist likens pride to a chain about the neck (Ps 73:6), and in Pr it is stated that the young man who hears the instruction of his father and forsakes not the law of his mother shall find that they are chains about his neck (Pr 1:9). In Re 20:1 the angel is described as descending with a great chain in his hand. According to the King James Version Peter speaks of the fallen angels as having been delivered into &quot;chains of darkness&quot; (2Pe 2:4), seira, and Jude speaks of them as being reserved in &quot;everlasting chains&quot; (Jude 1:6, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;bonds&quot;), desmos.See also PUNISHMENTS.A.

The Chaldeans as Learned Men&quot;Kasdim,&quot; &quot;land of Kasdim&quot; or &quot;the Chaldeans,&quot; is the usual designation, in the Old Testament, for the land and the people (Jer 50:10; 51:24; 24:5; 25:12). The corresponding Greek form with l for s follows the Assyr-Bab Kaldu, mat Kaldi, &quot;Chaldean, land of the Chaldeans.&quot; Kasdim is possibly connected with the name of Kesed (Kesedh), nephew of Abraham (Ge 22:22), and may be derived from the Assyr-Bab root kasadu, &quot;to capture,&quot; suggesting that the Chaldeans were originally tribes of nomadic plunderers (compare Job 1:17).1. Geographical Position:Seats of the Chaldeans:In its widest acceptation, Chaldea is the name of the whole of Babylonia, owing to the fact that the Chaldeans had given more than one king to the country. In the strict sense, however, their domain was the tract at the Northwest end of the Persian Gulf, which was often called by the Assyro-Babylonians mat Tamtim, &quot;the Land of the Sea,&quot; a province of unknown extent. When these tribes migrated into Babylonia is uncertain, as is also their original home; but as they are closely related to the Arameans, it is possible that their first settlements lay in the neighborhood of the Aramean states bordering on the Holy Land. Tiglath-pileser IV (742 BC) speaks of the ra&#x27;asani or chiefs of the Kaldu, and the mention of numerous Aramean tribes in Babylonia itself shows that their example of settling there soon found imitators, as did the Anglo-Saxons when they invaded Britain. Among the Chaldean tribes in Babylonia may be mentioned Bit Amukkani, whose capital was Sapia; Bit Yakin which furnished the dynasty to which Merodach-baladan II belonged; and probably also Bit Dakkuri, as all three lay near the Persian Gulf. Sargon of Assyria excludes Bit-Amukkani and Bit-Dakkuri, and speaks of &quot;the whole of the land of Chaldea, as much as there is; the land of Bit-Yakini, on the shore of the Salt River (the Persian Gulf), to the border of Tilmun&quot; (the island of Bahrein and the adjacent mainland) (Pavement Inscr., IV, ll. 82, 83, 85, 86). It was probably the influence of theBabylonians among whom they settled which changed these nomads into city-dwellers. Sennacherib refers to 75 (var. 89) strong cities and fortresses of Chaldea, and 420 (var. 800) smaller towns which were around them; and there were also Chaldeans (and Arameans) in Erech, Nippur (Calneh), Kis, Hursag-kalama, Cuthah, and probably Babylon.2. Originally Sumero-Akkadian:The &quot;land of the sea&quot; (mat Tamtim)is mentioned in the chronicle of the early Babylonian kings (rev. 14) as being governed by Ea-gamil, contemporary...</p>

When limestone is burned, it is converted into lime, which is easily broken into pieces, and, if allowed to remain open to the air, becomes slaked by the moisture of the atmosphere and crumbles into dust. The reference is to the destruction of the altar. It may mean that the altar will be burned so that the stones will become lime, or, more probably, that the stones of the altar will be broken as chalkstones (i.e. lumps of quicklime) are broken. There is no doubt that lime was known to the Egyptians, Assyrians and Hebrews, though clay, with or without straw, was more commonly used in building. Even bitumen (&quot;slime&quot;) appears to have been used for mortar.See CLAY; LIME; SLIME.Alfred Ely Day</p>

For the arrangement of rooms in a Hebrew house, see HOUSE. Chedher is a word of frequent occurrence, and designates a private room. Chuppah is translated &quot;chamber&quot; only in Ps 19:5, where it is used in connection with &quot;bridegroom,&quot; and means a bridal chamber. The same Hebrew word used of the bride in Joe 2:16 is rendered &quot;closet.&quot; Yatsia` and yatsua` are found only in 1Ki 6:5,6,10 (the King James Version only in all the passages), yatsua` being the reading of Kethibh and yatsia` of Kere in each ease. Here the meaning is really &quot;story,&quot; as given in the Revised Version (British and American), except in 1Ki 6:6, where doubtless the text should be changed to read ha-tsela`, &quot;the side-chamber.&quot; Lishkah, a frequent word, and the equivalent nishkah, infrequent, are used ordinarily of a room in the temple utilized for sacred purposes, occasionally of a room in the palace. `Aliyah and the equivalent Aramaic `illith signify &quot;a roof chamber,&quot; i.e. a chamber built on the flat roof of a house. Tsela`, when used of a chamber, designates a side-chamber of the temple. It is usually rendered &quot;side-chamber,&quot; but &quot;chamber&quot; in 1Ki 6:5,8 (the King James Version), where the Revised Version (British and American) has &quot;side-chamber.&quot;George Ricker Berry</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ka-me&#x27;-le-un (koach, the Revised Version (British and American) LAND CROCODILE (Le 11:30); tinshemeth, the King James Version mole, the Revised Version (British and American) CHAMELEON (Le 11:30)):Koach, which in the King James Version is rendered &quot;chameleon&quot; and in the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;land crocodile,&quot; means also &quot;strength&quot; or &quot;power,&quot; as in Ge 4:12; 1Sa 2:9; Ps 22:15; Isa 40:29, and many other passages. The Septuagint has chamaileon, but on account of the ordinary meaning of the word, koach, it has been thought that some large lizard should be understood here. The desert monitor, Varanus griseus, one of the largest of lizards, sometime attaining the length of 4 ft., is common in Palestine and may be the animal here referred to. The name &quot;monitor&quot; is a translation of the German warnen, &quot;to warn,&quot; with which has been confused the Arabic name of this animal, waran or waral, a word of uncertain etymology.The word tinshemeth in the same verse is rendered in the King James Version &quot;mole&quot; and in the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;chameleon.&quot; The Septuagint has aspalax (= spalax, &quot;mole&quot;). Tinshemeth also occurs in the lists of unclean birds in Le 11:18 and De 14:16, where it is rendered: the King James Version &quot;swan&quot;; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;horned owl&quot;; Septuagint porphurion (i.e. &quot;coot&quot; or, according to some, &quot;heron&quot;); Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 A. D.) cygnus, &quot;swan.&quot; It appears to come from the root nasham, &quot;to breathe&quot;; compare neshamah, &quot;breath&quot; (Ge 2:7; Job 27:3 the King James Version, etc.). It has therefore in Le 11:30 been referred to the chameleon on account of the chameleon&#x27;s habit of puffing up its body with air and hissing, and in the other passages to the pelican, on account of the pelican&#x27;s great pouched bill.The common chameleon is abundant in Palestine, being found also in North Africa and in Spain. The other species of chameleons are found principally in Africa and Madagascar. It is not only a harmless but a decidedly useful creature, since it feeds upon insects, especially flies. Its mode of capturing its prey is most interesting. It slowly and cautiously advances until its head is from 4 to 6 inches from the insect, which it then secures by darting out its tongue with great rapidity. The pigment cel ls in its skin enable it to change its color from pale yellow to bright green, dark green and almost black, so that it can harmonize very perfectly with its surroundings. Its peculiar toes and prehensile tail help to fit it for its life in the trees. Its prominent eyes with circular lids, like iris diaphragms can be moved independently of each other, and add to its striking appearance.See LAND-CROCODILE; MOLE; SWAN; OWL; PELICAN.Alfred Ely Day</p>

Gesenius refers to the verb zamar, &quot;to sing,&quot; and suggests the association of dancing or leaping, indicating thereby an active animal. M&#x27;Lean in Encyclopedia Biblica cites the rendering of the Targums dica&#x27;, or &quot;wild goat.&quot; Now there are two wild goats in Palestine. The better known is the ibex of the South, which may well be the ya`el (English Versions, &quot;wild goat&quot;; Job 39:1; Ps 104:18; 1Sa 24:2), as well as the &#x27;aqqo (English Version, &quot;wild goat,&quot; De 14:5). The other is the pasang or Persian wild goat which ranges from the Northeast of Palestine and the Syrian desert to Persia, and which may be the zemer (English Versions &quot;chamois&quot;). The accompanying illustration, which is taken from the Royal Natural History, shows the male and female and young. The male is distinguished by its larger horns and goatee. The horns are in size and curvature very similar to those of the ibex (see GOAT, section 2) , but the front edge is like a nicked blade instead of being thick and knotty as in the ibex. Like the ibex it is at home among the rocks, and climbs apparently impossible cliffs with marvelous ease.Tristram (NHB) who is followed by Post (HDB) suggests that zemer may be the Barbary sheep (Ovis tragelaphus), though the latter is only known to inhabit the Atlas Mountains, from the Atlantic to Tunis. Tristram supports his view by reference to a kebsh (&quot;ram&quot;) which the Arabs say lives in the mountains of Sinai, though they have apparently neither horns nor skins to show as trophies, and it is admitted that no European has seen it. The true chamois (Rupicapra tragus) inhabits the high mountains from t he Pyrenees to the Caucasus, and there is no reason to suppose that it was ever found in Syria or Palestine.Alfred Ely Day</p>

Eze 47:8 has for ha-`arabhah &quot;the desert,&quot; the King James Version margin &quot;plain,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;the Arabah.&quot; The plural is used in Jos 5:10; 2Ki 25:5, &quot;the plains of Jericho,&quot; and in Nu 22:1; 26:3, &quot;the plains of Moab.&quot; Elsewhere `arabhah is rendered in English Versions of the Bible &quot;desert&quot; or &quot;wilderness&quot; (Job 24:5; 39:6; Isa 33:9; 35:1,6; 40:3; 41:19; 51:3; Jer 2:6; 17:6; 50:12). At the present day, the Jordan va lley is called the Ghaur (compare Hebrew `ur, &quot;to dig,&quot; me`arah, &quot;cave,&quot; and Arabic magharah, &quot;cave&quot;). This name is also applied to the deltas of streams flowing into the Dead Sea from the East, which are clothed with thickets of thorny trees and shrubs, i.e. Ghaur-ul-Mezra`ah, at the mouths of Wadi-Kerak and Wadi-Beni-Chammad, Ghaur-uc-Cafiyeh, at the mouth of Wadi-ul-Hisa. The name &quot;Arabah&quot; (Arabic al-`Arabah) is now confined to the valley running southward from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Akabah, separating the mountains of Edom from Sinai and the plateau of at-Tih.See ARABAH.Eze 37:2 the King James Version margin has &quot;champaign&quot; for biq`ah, which is elsewhere rendered &quot;vale&quot; or &quot;valley.&quot; Biq`ah seems to be applied to wide, open valleys, as: &quot;the valley of Jericho&quot; (De 34:3), &quot;the valley of Megiddo&quot; (2Ch 35:22; Zec 12:11), &quot;the valley of Lebanon&quot; (Jos 11:17). If Baal-Gad be Ba`albeq and &quot;the valley of Lebanon&quot; be Coele-syria, the present name of Coele-syria, al-Biqa` (plural of buq`ah, &quot;a low, wet place or meadow&quot;), may be regarded as a survival of the Hebre w biq`ah.Alfred Ely Day</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">chans: The idea of chance in the sense of something wholly fortuitous was utterly foreign to the Hebrew creed. Throughout the whole course of Israel&#x27;s history, to the Hebrew mind, law, not chance, ruled the universe, and that law was not something blindly mechanical, but the expression of the personal Yahweh. Israel&#x27;s belief upon this subject may be summed up in the couplet,  &quot;The lot is cast into the lap; But the whole disposing thereof is of Yahweh&quot; (Pr 16:33).  A number of Hebrew and Greek expressions have been translated &quot;chance,&quot; or something nearly equivalent, but it is noteworthy that of the classical words for chance, suntuchia, and tuche, the former never occurs in the Bible and the latter only twice in the Septuagint.The closest approach to the idea of chance is found in the statement of the Philistines that if their device for ascertaining the cause of their calamities turned out a certain way they would call them a chance, that is, bad luck (miqreh, 1Sa 6:9). But note that it was a heathen people who said this. We have the same Hebrew noun and the verb, from which the noun is taken, a number of times, but variously rendered into English: Uncleanness that &quot;chanceth him by night&quot; (De 23:10). &quot;Her hap was to ligh t on the portion of the field&quot; (Ru 2:3). &quot;Something hath befallen him&quot; (1Sa 20:26). &quot;One event happeneth to them all&quot; (Ec 2:14,15); &quot;that which befalleth the sons of men&quot; (&quot;sons of men are a chance,&quot; the English Revised Version, margin) (Ec 3:19). &quot;There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked&quot; (Ec 9:2,3). Here the idea certainly is not something independent of the will of God, but something unexpected by man.There is also qara&#x27;, &quot;If a bird&#x27;s nest chance to be before thee in the way&quot; (De 22:6). Both the above Hebrew words are combined in the statement &quot;As I happened by chance upon Mount Gilboa&quot; (2Sa 1:6). &quot;And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David&quot; (&quot;met the servants,&quot; 2Sa 18:9, the King James Version). &quot;And there happened to be there a base fellow&quot; (2Sa 20:1).We have also pegha`, &quot;Time and chance happeneth to them all,&quot; meaning simply occurrence (Ec 9:11). &quot;Neither adversary, nor evil occurrence&quot; (1Ki 5:4).In the New Testament we have sugkuria, &quot;coincidence,&quot; a meeting apparently accidental, a coincidence. &quot;By chance a certain priest was going down that way&quot; (Lu 10:31). Also ei tuchoi. &quot;It may chance of wheat, or of some other kind,&quot; i.e. we cannot tell which (1Co 15:37). &quot;It may be&quot; (1Co 14:10).If we look at the Septuagint we find tuche used twice. &quot;And Leah said, (En tuche) With fortune&quot; (&quot;a troop cometh,&quot; the King James Version; &quot;fortunate,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American); &quot;with fortune,&quot; the Revised Version, margin, Ge 30:11). Note, it was no Israelite, but who said this. &quot;That prepare a table for Fortune, and that fill up mingled wine unto Destiny&quot; (&quot;fate,&quot; Isa 65:11). In this passage tuche stands or the Hebrew meni, the god of destiny, and Fortune is for Gad, the old Semitic name for the god of...</p>

In 2Sa 22:16 (compare Ps 18:15) we have:  &quot;Then the channels of the sea appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare, By the rebuke of Yahweh, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.&quot;  This is reminiscent of &quot;fountains of the deep&quot; (Ge 7:11; 8:2; Pr 8:28). It is a question how far we should attribute to these ancient writers a share in modern notions of oceanography, but the idea seems to be that of a withdrawal of the water of the ocean, and the laying bare of submarine declivities and channels such as we know to exist as the result of erosion during a previous period of elevation, when the given portion of ocean floor was dry land.The fact that many streams of Palestine flow only during the rainy season seems to be referred to in Job 6:15; and perhaps also in Ps 126:4.See BROOK; RIVER.Alfred Ely Day</p>

Chariots of Egypt2. Chariots of the Canaanites3. Chariots of Solomon and Later Kings4. Chariots of the Assyrians5. Chariots of Chaldeans, Persians, Greeks6. In the New Testament7. Figurative UseLITERATURE1. Chariots of Egypt:It is to the chariots of ancient Egypt that reference is first made in Scripture. Joseph was honored by being made to ride in the second chariot of King Pharaoh (Ge 41:43). Joseph paid honor to his father on his arrival in Goshen by meeting him in his chariot (Ge 46:29). In the state ceremonial with which the remains of Jacob were escorted to Canaan, chariots and horsemen were conspicuous (Ge 50:9). In the narrative of the departure of the Israelites from Egypt and of Pharaoh&#x27;s futile attempts to detain them the chariots and horsemen of Pharaoh figure largely (Ex 14:17,18,23,15; 15:4,19). It was with the Hyksos invasion, some centuries before the Exodus, that the horse, and subsequently the chariot, were introduced for purposes of war into Egypt; and it may have been the possession of chariots that enabled those hated shepherd warriors to overpower the native Egyptians. The Egyptian chariot was distinguished by its lightness of build. It was so reduced in weight that it was possible for a man to carry his chariot on his shoulders without fatigue. The ordinary chariot was made of wood and leather, and had only two occupants, the fighting man and his shield-bearer. The royal chariots were ornamented with gold and silver, and in the battle of Megiddo Thothmes III is represented as standing in his chariot of electrum like the god of war, brandishing his lance. In the battle the victorious Egyptians captured 2,041 horses and 924 chariots from the Syrian allies.2. Chariots of the Canaanites:The Canaanites had long been possessed of horses and chariots when Joshua houghed their horses and burnt their chariots with fire at the waters of Merom (Jos 11:6,9). The chariots of iron which the Canaanites could maneuvere in the plains and valleys proved a formidable obstacle to the Complete conquest of the land (Jud 1:19). Jabin had 900 chariots of iron, and with them he was able to oppress the children of Israel twenty years (Jud 4:3). The Philistines of the low country and the maritime plain, of whom we read in Judges and Samuel, were a warlike people, were disciplined and well armed and their possession of chariots gave them a great advantage over the Israelites. In the war of Michmash they put into the field the incredible number of 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, only in the end to suffer a grievous defeat (1Sa 13:5; 14:20). In the battle of Gilboa, however, the chariots and horsemen of the Philistines bore down all opposition, and proved the destruction of Saul and his house. Of these chariots there have come down to us no detailed description and no representation. But we cannot be far wrong in turning to the chariot of the Hittites as a type of th...</p>

They are said to have stood in the temple, a gift of the kings of Judah. Josiah removed the horses from the precincts of the temple and burned the chariots. Among the Greeks, Helios was endowed with horses and chariots. Thus the course of the sun as he sped across the skies was understood by the mythological mind of antiquity. The Babylonian god Shamash (= Hebrew Shemesh) likewise had his chariot and horses as well as his charioteer. The cult of the sun and other heavenly bodies which was particularly in vogue during the latter days of the Judean monarchy (compare 2Ki 23:5; Eze 8:16 f; De 17:3; Jer 8:2) seems to have constituted an element of the Canaanitish religion (compare the names of localities like Beth-shemesh and the like).

English Translation6. Inward Motive7. Character8. Ultimate Ideal  9. Almsgiving10. ToleranceIn the King James Version in 26 places from 1Co 8:1 onward. The same Greek word, which appears in the New Testament 115 times, is elsewhere translated by &quot;love.&quot;1. A New Word:The substantive agape is mainly, if not exclusively, a Biblical and ecclesiastical word (see Deissmann, Bible Studies, 198 ff), not found in profane writings, although the verb agapan, from which it is derived, is used in classical Greek in the sense of &quot;love, founded in admiration, veneration, esteem, like the Latin diligere&quot; (Grimm-Thayer), rather than natural emotion (Latin, amare).2. A New Ideal:It is a significant evidence of the sense of a new ideal and principle of life that permeated the Christian consciousness of the earliest communities, that they should have made current a new word to express it, and that they should derive that word, not from the current or philosophical language of Greek morality, but from the Septuagint.3. An Apostolic Term:In the New Testament the word is apostolic, and appears first and predominantly in the Pauline writings. It is found only twice in the Synoptics (Mt 24:12; Lu 11:42), and although it is in both places put in the mouth of the Saviour, it can easily be understood how the language of a later time may have been used by the narrator, when it is considered that these gospels were compiled and reduced to writing many years after the spread of the Pauline epistles. The word is not found in James, Mark or Acts, but it appears in Paul 75 times, in John 30 times, in Peter 4 times, in Jude twice and in Hebrews twice. Jesus Christ gave the thing and the spirit in the church, and the apostles (probably Paul) invented the term to express it.4. Latin Equivalents:When Jerome came to translate the Greek Testament into Latin, he found in that language no word to represent agape. Amor was too gross, and he fell back on dilectio and caritas, words which, however, in their original meanings were too weak and colorless to represent agape adequately. No principle seems to have guided him in the choice of the one word or the other in particular places.5. English Translation:Caritas in English became &quot;charity,&quot; and was taken over by the English translators from the Vulg, though not with any regularity, nor as far as can be judged, according to any definite principle, except that it is used of agape only in man, never as it denotes a quality or action of God, which is always translated by &quot;love.&quot; When agape is translated by &quot;charity&quot; it means either(1) a disposition in man which may qualify his own character (1Co 8:1) and be ready to go forth to God (1Co 8:3) or to men; or(2) an active and actual relation with other men, generally within the church (Col 3:14; 1Th 3:6; 2Th 1:3; 1Ti 1:5; 4:12; 1Pe 4:8; 5:14), but also absolutely and universally (1Co 13).

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">charm: Definition.--The word charm is derived from the Latin carmen, &quot;a song,&quot; and denotes strictly what is sung; then it comes to mean a magical formula chanted or recited with a view to certain desired results. Charm is distinguished from amulet in this, that the latter is a material object having as such a magical potency, though it is frequently an inscribed formula on it that gives this object its power (see AMULET). The word charm stands primarily for the incantation, though it is often applied to an inscribed amulet.A charm may be regarded as having a positive or a negative effect. In the first case it is supposed to secure some desired object or result (see AMULET). In the second, it is conceived as having the power of warding off evils, as the evil eye, the inflictions of evil spirits and the like. In the last, its negative meaning, the word &quot;countercharm&quot; (German, Gegenzauber) is commonly used.Charms are divisible into two general classes according as they are written (or printed) or merely spoken:(1) Written charms--Of these we have examples in the phylacteries and the mezuzah noticed in the article AMULET. In Ac 19:13-20 we read of written charms used by the Ephesians, such as are elsewhere called (ephesia grammata). Such magical formulas were written generally on leather, though sometimes on papyrus, on lead, and even on gold. Those mentioned in the above passage must have been inscribed on some very valuable material, gold perhaps, or they could not have cost 2,000 British pounds (= 50,000 drachmas). Charms of the kind have been dug up from the ruins of Ephesus. In modern Egypt drinking-bowls are used, inscribed with passages from the Koran, and it is considered very lucky to drink from such a &quot;lucky bowl,&quot; as it is called. Parts of the Koran and often complete miniature copies are worn by Egyptians and especially by Egyptian soldiers during war. These are buried with the dead bodies, just as the ancient Egyptians interred with their dead portions of the Book of the Dead or even the whole book, and as the early Abyssinians buried with dead bodies certain magical texts. Josephus (Ant., VIII, ii, 5) says that Solomon composed incantations by which demons were exorcised and diseases healed.(2) Spoken charms are at least as widespread as those inscribed. Much importance was attached by the ancients (Egyptians, Babylonians, etc.) to the manner in which the incantations were recited, as well as to the substance of the formulas. If beautifully uttered, and with sufficient frequency, such incantations possessed unlimited power. The stress laid on the mode of reciting magical charms necessitated the existence of a priestly class and did much to increase the power of such a class. The binding force of the uttered word is implied in many parts of the Old Testament (see Jos 9:20). Though the princes of Israel had promised under false pretenses to make a covenant on behalf of Israel with the Gibeonites, they refused to break their promise becaus...</p>

The narrower term occurs in the Revised Version (British and American) but once in the New Testament and then in its verbal form, Lu 23:16: &quot;I will therefore chastise him.&quot; the King James Version uses it also in Heb 12:8.The meaning of the word paideia grows with the progress of revelation. Its full significance is unfolded in the New Testament, when reconciliation through Christ has brought into prominence the true fatherhood of God (Heb 12:5,10). In the Old Testament, where it occurs about 40 times, the radical meaning is that simply of training, as in De 8:5: &quot;As a man chasteneth his son, so Yahweh thy God chasteneth thee.&quot; But, as in a dispensation where the distinguishing feature is that of the strictest justice, retributive punishment becomes not only an important, but a controlling factor. in the training, as in Le 26:28: &quot;I will chastise you seven times for your sins.&quot; In this sense, it is used of chastisements inflicted by man even unjustly: &quot;My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions&quot; (1Ki 12:11). As, therefore, the thought of the suffering inflicted, or that of the end toward which it is directed, preponderates, the Psalmist can pray: &quot;Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure&quot; (Ps 6:1), and take comfort in the words: &quot;Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest&quot; (Ps 94:12). Hence, it is common in both the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) to find the Hebrew mucar, and Greek paideia translated as &quot;instruction.&quot; Illustrations are most numerous in Prov.In the New Testament the Greek paideia is used with a variety similar to its corresponding Hebrew in the Old Testament. Examples of the fundamental idea, namely, that of &quot;training,&quot; are found in such passages as Ac 7:22; 22:3, where Moses and Paul are said to have been &quot;instructed,&quot; and 2Ti 3:16, where Scripture is said to be &quot;profitable .... for instruction&quot; (compare 1Ti 1:20; 2Ti 2:25; Tit 2:12; Ro 2:20). A similar, but not identical, thought, is found in Eph 6:4: &quot;Nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the Lord.&quot; But when paideia is described as bringing pain, the mystery of suffering, which in the Old Testament is most fully treated in the Book of Job, at last finds its explanation. The child of God realizes that he cannot be beneath God&#x27;s wrath, and hence, that the chastening which he endures is not destructive, but corrective (1Co 10:13; 11:32; 2Co 6:9; Re 3:19). In Heb 12:5-11, such consolation is afforded, not, as in the above passages, by incidental allusions, but by a full argument upon the basis of ...</p>

The Importance of the SeriesThe name of the Elamite overlord with whom Amraphel, Arioch and Tidal marched against Sodom and Gomorrah, and the other cities of the plain (Ge 14:1 ff). The Greek (Septuagint) form of the name is Chodollogomor, implying a different vocalization, the assimilation of &quot;R &quot;with &quot;L&quot;, and the pronunciation of &quot;`o&quot; as &quot;gho&quot; (Codorlaghomer). This suggests that the Elamite form, in cuneiform, would be Kudur-lagamar, the second element being the name of a god, and the whole therefore meaning &quot;servant of La`omer&quot; (Lagamar), or the like. A Babylonian deity worshippeal at Dilmu, Lagamal, may be the same as the Elamite Lagamar. This name is not found in the cuneiform inscriptions, unless it be, as is possible, the fancifully-written Kudur-lah(gu)mal (or Kodorlahgomal) of three late Babylonian legends, one of which is in poetical form. Besides this Elamite ruler, two of these tablets mention also a certain Eri-Aku or Eri-Akua, son of Durmah-ilani, and one of them refers to Tudhul(a) or Tidal.See ERI-AKU, 4.1. Was He the Elamite King Kudur-lahgumal?:Objections have been made to the identification of Chedorlaomer with the Kudur-lah(gu)mal of these texts, some Assyriologists having flatly denied the possibility, while others expressed the opinion that, though these names were respectively those with which they have been identified, they were not the personages referred to in Ge 14, and many have refrained from expressing an opinion at all. The main reason for the identification of Kudur-lah(gu)mal(?) with Chedorlaomer is its association with the names Eri-Eaku and Tudgul(a) found on two of the documents. No clear references to the expedition against the Cities of the Plain, however, have been found in these texts.2. Kudur-lahgumal and the Babylonians:The longer of the two prose compositions (Brit. Mus., Sp. II, 987) refers to the bond of heaven (extended?) to the four regions, and the fame which he (Merodach?) set for (the Elamites) in Babylon, the city of (his) glory. So (?the gods), in their faithful (or everlasting) counsel, decreed to Kudur-lahgumal, king of Elam (their favor?). He came down, and (performed) what was good to them, and exercised dominion in Babylon, the city of Kar-Dunias (Babylonia). When in power, however, he acted in a way which did not please the Babylonians, for he loved the winged fowl, and favored the dog which crunched the bone. &quot;What(?) king of Elam was there who had (ever) (shown favor to?) the shrine of E-saggil?&quot; (E-sagila, the great temple of Belus at Babylon).3. The Son of Eri-Ekua:A letter from Durmah-ilani son of Eri-Ekua (?Arioch) is at this point quoted, and possibly forms the justification for the sentences which...</p>

The oriental guards with jealous care his cheek from touch or defilement, therefore a stroke on the cheek was, and is to this day, regarded as an act of extreme rudeness of behavior, a deadly affront. Our Saviour, however, teaches us in Mt 5:39 and Lu 6:29 that even this insult is to be ignored and pardoned.Jawbones of animals have been frequently used as tools and weapons among primitive people. We see this sufficiently proven from cave deposits in many parts of the world, and from recent ethnological researches, especially in Australia. In the light of this evidence it is interesting to note that Samson used a jawbone of an ass with success against his enemies the Philistines (Jud 15:15).(2) malqoach (Ps 22:15), is a dual form indicative of the two jaws, to which a parched tongue seems to cleave.(3) methalle`ah (Job 29:17), better &quot;cheek teeth&quot; (which see).H.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kem&#x27;-a-rim (kemarim, a plural whose singular komer is not found in the Old Testament): Occurs only once in the text of English Versions of the Bible (Ze 1:4, the King James Version Chemarims), though the Hebrew word is found also in 2Ki 23:5 (English Versions &quot;idolatrous priests&quot;) and Ho 10:5 (English Versions &quot;priests,&quot; English Versions margins, however, having &quot;Chemarim&quot; in both places). Some regard the word as an interpolation in Ze 1:4, since the Septuagint omits it and its presence disturbs the parallelism. The word, which is of Aramaic origin (kumra, priest), is used in the Old Testament only in an unfavorable sense, its origin and associations naturally suggesting Syriac affinities. In the Syriac, however, no such connotation is involved. In the Peshitta version of the Old Testament it is used indifferently of idolatrous priests and of priests of Yahweh, while in the same version of the New Testament it is used of the Levitical priests and of our Lord (e.g. Heb 2:17; 3:1; 4:14,15, and often) and in Ac 19:35 it is the rendering of neokoros (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;temple-keeper,&quot; the King James Version &quot;worshipper&quot;). The question of the root idea of the word remains unsettled. The traditional supposition, which finds some support even among modern scholars, is that the verbal form means &quot;to be black,&quot; the priests being supposed to have been clad in black. But it is doubtful whether the root had this meaning. Another conjecture takes the root to mean &quot;to be sad,&quot; the priest being a man of a sad countenance, an ascetic. Cheyne would relate the word to the Assyrian kummaru, having the sense of &quot;a clean vesture.&quot; It is at all events probable that the priests, both in Israel and in the surrounding nations, employed white vestments, rather than black, when in the performance of their official functions. According to the Mishna, Middoth, verse 4, a Levitical priest who had become disqualified for service put on black garments and departed, while the others put on white garments and went in and ministered. The reference to the Baal worship in 2Ki 10:22 seems more congruous with this view; hence, probably blackrobed priests (Chemarim) of Baal and the unfaithful priests of Yahweh shall be cut off together. G. A. Smith (BTP, II, 56) reads &quot;the priestlings with the priests.&quot;J. R. Van Pelt</p>

Parallels between Inscription and Old Testament Record9. Ethical ContrastLITERATURE1. Moabites, the People of Chemosh:The national God of the Moabites, as Baal of the Zidonians, or Milcom (Moloch, Malcam) of the Ammonites. The Moabites are apostrophized in an old Hebrew song as the &quot;people of Chemosh&quot; (Nu 21:29). Jeremiah in his oracle of doom upon Moab has recourse to the same old song and calls the people &quot;the people of Chemosh.&quot; The impotence of the god to deliver his people is described by the prophet in figures representing him as going into captivity with them, his priests and princes together, and Moab is to be ashamed of him as Israel was of the Golden Calf of Bethel, which did not avail to save the Northern Kingdom from the conquering Assyrian power (Jer 48:7,13,16).2. Solomon and Chemosh Worship:For Chemosh, &quot;the abomination of Moab,&quot; as for Moloch, &quot;the abomination of the children of Ammon,&quot; Solomon, under the influence of his idolatrous wives, built a high place in the mount before Jerusalem (1Ki 11:7). It was natural that they should desire to worship still after the manner of the gods of their native land, but although the effect of all this was seen in the moral and spiritual deterioration of Solomon himself there is no indication that the immoralities and cruelties associated with such worship were then practiced in Jerusalem. In the days of Ahaz and Manasseh, even as early as the days of Abijam of Judah, they were (1Ki 15:12,13).3. Josiah Putting Down Chemosh Worship:Josiah found these abominations of alien worship, which had been introduced by Solomon and added to by Ahaz and Manasseh, flourishing when he came to the throne. Moved by the prohibitions of the Book of the Law (De 12:29-31; 18:10), Josiah pulled down and defiled the high places and the altars, and in order to make a clean sweep of the idolatrous figures, &quot;he brake in pieces the pillars,&quot; or obelisks, &quot;and cut down the Asherim,&quot; or sacred poles, &quot;and filled their places with the bones of men&quot; (2Ki 23:1- 20).4. Chemosh and Ammonites:There is one passage where Chemosh is designated the god of the Ammonites (Jud 11:24). Jephthah is disputing the right of the Ammonites to invade territory which belongs to Israel because Yahweh has given it to them by conquest. And he asks: `Shouldst thou not possess the territory of those whom Chemosh, thy god, dispossesses, and we the territory of all whom Yahweh, our god, dispossesses?&#x27; It may be that he is called here the god of the Ammonites by a mere oversight of the historian; or that Moab and Ammon being kindred nations descended from a common ancestor, Lot, Chemosh may in a sense belong to both. We notice, however, that Jephthah&#x27;s argument in meeting the claim preferred by the king of Ammon...</p>

In 1Sa 30:16 this land is apparently identical with that of the Philistines.

See, however, CAPHTOR. It may be taken as certain that the Cherethites were a Philistine clan. In conjunction with the Pelethites they are frequently named as forming the guard of David (2Sa 8:18, etc.). It was the custom of many ancient monarchs to have a guard of foreign mercenaries.W.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">cher&#x27;-u-bim, cher&#x27;-oo-bim (kerubhim, plural of cherub, kerubh): Through the influence of the Septuagint, &quot;cherubim&quot; was used in the earlier English versions, also as a singular, hence, the plural was made to sound &quot;cherubims.&quot; The etymology of the word cannot be ascertained.1. As Guardians of Paradise:In Ge 3:24 the cherubim are placed by God, after the expulsion of Adam from the garden of Eden, at the east thereof, together with the flaming sword &quot;to keep the way of the tree of life.&quot; In their function as guardians of Paradise the cherubim bear an analogy to the winged bulls and lions of Babylonia and Assyria, colossal figures with human faces standing guard at the entrance of temples (and palaces), just as in Egypt the approaches to the sanctuaries are guarded by sphinxes. But the Babylonian colossi go by the name of lamassu, or shedu; no designation at all approaching the Hebrew kerubh has so far been found in the Assyrian language. Nor are thus named the winged figures, half human and half animal, which in Babylonian and Persian art are found on both sides of the &quot;sacred tree.&quot; Thus, a Babylonian origin of the Hebrew cherubim is neither proved nor disproved. If we look for further analogies which, of course, do not indicate a borrowing on the part of the Hebrews, we may mention the fabulous griffins (grupes), usually represented as having the heads and wings of an eagle and the body and hind quarters of a lion; they were believed by the Greeks to inhabit Scythia, and to keep jealous watch over the gold of that country.2. The Garden as the Abode of the Gods:If we read between the lines of the Paradise account in Ge (compare Ge 3:8), the garden of Eden, the primeval abode of man, reveals itself as more than that: it was apparently the dwelling-place of God. In the polytheistic story of the creation of the world and early life of man, which, while in several respects analogous (compare Ge 3:22), is devoid of the more spiritual notions of Hebraism, the garden was the abode of the gods who alone had access to the tree of life from the fruit of which they derived their immortality. Adam, before the fall, is conceived as a superhuman being; for while he is forbidden to taste of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, the way to immortality is open to him; for it is only after transgressing the Divine command that he merits death and becomes mortal. The choice of immortal innocence and mortal knowledge lay before him; he elected death with knowledge.3. The Cherubim as Attendants of the Deity:The mythical elements of the Paradise story are still more patent in Eze 28:13 ff, where the fall of the king of Tyre is likened to that of primeval man. The garden is situated on a holy mountain of Elohim(= God to Ezekiel, but gods in the primitive source), the `mountain of assembly&#x27; of Isa 14:13, high above the stars in the recesses of the North. It is a wonderful place, adorned with all manner of precious stones. There man, perfect from the day he was created, res...</p>

The early Babylonian form Kasdu appears in Assyrian as Kaldu or Kaldu. English Versions of the Bible follows the Assyrian and Greek style of writing the name and uses Chaldees or Chaldeans instead of Casdim. The Chaldeans dwelt in the lower valley of the Euphrates, at the head of the Persian Gulf. Abram came from Ur of the Chaldees (Ge 11:28,31; 15:7; Ne 9:7). In Job 1:17 the Casdim are described as invading the land of Uz, the eldest brother of Chesed (Ge 22:21,22). In the days of Nebuchadrezzar the Casdim overran Syria and Palestine and carried the people of Judah in successive deportations into captivity (2Ki 24:1-10; 25:1 ff). In Da 2:2,5 the Casdim are named with the magicians and astrologers as a learned class, skilled in interpretations. Casdim is sometimes used in Hebrew for the land of Chaldea (Eze 23:15 f; 11:24).John Richard Sampey</p>

It is the &quot;chest&quot; that Jehoiada, the priest, placed in the court &quot;beside the altar&quot; and &quot;bored a hole in the lid of&quot; that the priests might &quot;put therein all the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh&quot; (2Ki 12:9); and &quot;the chest&quot; that King Joash commanded to be made and set &quot;without at the gate of the house of Yahweh&quot; to receive &quot;the tax that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel&quot; (2Ch 24:8,10,11). One feature is common to the thing meant in all these applications--the c. was rectangular in shape, and, most probably in every instance, made of wood.(4) Josephus (Ant., VI, 1,2) uses the equivalent of the word to denote the &quot;coffer&quot; (1Sa 6:8 ff English Versions), or small chest, in which the princes of Philistia deposited the gold mice.(5) In New Testament times the &quot;chests&quot; that were provided in the court of the women, in the temple of Herod, to receive the various kinds of money gifts had the exceptional shape of a trumpet (if Sheqalim, vi.5 may be trusted)--wide at the bottom and gradually narrowing toward the top, hence, called shopharoth. It was into these that the Master was watching the multitude casting in their money when He saw the poor widow cast in her two mites (Mr 12:41,42).(6) In Eze 27:24, where the prophet is giving an inventory of the merchandise of Tyre, another word entirely is used (genazim), and it is rendered in the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;chests&quot; (&quot;chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar&quot;). According to Cornill, Davidson, Smend and others this rendering is without sufficient support (see Smith, Dictionary of the Bible and commentary in the place cited.).George B. Eager</p>

Among the animals considered clean are therefore included the ox, the sheep, the goat, the hart, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the pygarg, the antelope and the chamois. Several of the forbidden animals are expressly named in the passages, e.g. the camel, the rock-badger, the hare and the swine. In addition to the distinctions between clean and unclean animals mentioned in the Bible, the Talmud points out that the clean animals have no upper teeth, that their horns are either forked, or if not forked they are clear of splinters, notched with scales and round, and that certain portions of the meat of clean animals tear lengthwise as well as across. Many theories have been advanced as to the reasons for the distinctions with regard to the chewing of the cud and the cloven hoof. See the Jewish Encyclopedia under the word &quot;Clean.&quot; The most obvious is that ruminating animals and animals without claws were apparently cleaner-feeding animals than the others.Nathan Isaacs</p>

The record is to be found in the books of the disciples, but Jesus is responsible for the only direct mention of chickens in the Bible. Mt 23:37, contains this: &quot;O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!&quot; Luke&#x27;s version of the same scene says: &quot;Even as a hen gathereth her own brood under her wings&quot; (Lu 13:34). There is no reference to chickens in the Old Testament sufficiently clear to specify our common domestic bird. The many references to &quot;fatted fowl&quot; in these older records, in accordance with the text and the history of the other nations, were pigeons, guineas, ducks, geese and swans. The importation of peafowl by Solomon is mentioned. The cock and hen are distinctive birds and would have been equally a marvel worth recording had they been introduced at that time. From the history of the bird in other countries it is a safe estimate to place their entrance into Palestine between five and six hundred years BC. That would allow sufficient time for them to increase and spread until they would be well known and common enough to be used effectively in the ministry of Jesus Christ. Every historical fact and indication points to the capture and domestication of the red jungle fowl in Burma. The Chinese records prove that they first secured imported fowl from the West in 1400 BC. Their use for food dated from 1200 to 800 BC, in the Book of Manu, but it was specified that only those that ran wild were to be eaten. From these countries they were imported to Greece and Italy, and from there carried south into Palestine Homer ([?] 10; compare also alektruon, P 602) names a man Cock, alektor, which seems to indicate that he knew the bird. Pindar gives them slight mention; Aristophanes wrote of them as &quot;Persian birds,&quot; which indicates that they worked their way westward by importation. I cannot find them in the records of Aristotle, but Aristophanes advanced the idea that not the gods, but the birds were rulers of men in ancient times, and compared the comb of the cock with the crown of a king, and pointed out that when he &quot;merely crows at dawn all jump up to their work&quot; (Aves, 489-90). They were common in Italy in the days of Pliny, who was ten years old at the time of the crucifixion of Christ. Pliny gave many rules for raising chickens, proving that much was known of their habits in his time. Yet so credulous was he and so saturated with superstition, that, mixed with his instructions for preserving eggs, brooding and raising chickens, is the statement that on account of the fighting power of the cocks the lions feared them. He wrote that a man named Galerius in the time of the consuls, Lepidus and Catulus, owned a barnyard fowl that spoke. He ...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">chef: The English word is in the King James Version of Old Testament the translation of some 17 different Hebrew words, most frequently of ro&#x27;sh, &quot;head,&quot; sar, &quot;prince,&quot; and re&#x27;shith, &quot;beginning.&quot; The principal changes made by the Revised Version (British and American) are:(1) Hebrew beth&#x27;abh, &quot;house of a father,&quot; being recognized as a technical term denoting a subdivision of a tribe, ro&#x27;sh is rendered literally &quot;head,&quot; when it occurs in connection with this phrase, so that &quot;chief fathers&quot; (Num 31:26) and &quot;chief of the fathers&quot; (Ezr 1:5) become &quot;heads of fathers&#x27; houses&quot;;(2) Hebrew naghidh and nasi&#x27; are more accurately translated &quot;prince&quot; in such passages as 1Ch 5:2; Nu 3:32;(3) the misinterpretations which brought about the translation &quot;chief&quot; for &#x27;atsilim, &quot;corners,&quot; Isa 41:9, and for ma`aleh, &quot;ascent,&quot; in 2Ch 32:33, are corrected.In the New Testament &quot;chief&quot; is in most of its appearances the translation of Greek protos, &quot;first&quot;; the Revised Version (British and American) reads &quot;first&quot; for the King James Version &quot;chief,&quot; &quot;chiefest,&quot; in Mt 20:27; Mr 10:44; Ac 16:12. The reading in the latter passage is a difficult one, but the King James Version &quot;Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia,&quot; seems to imply a political authority which Philippi did not possess; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;a city of Macedonia, the first of the district.&quot; Greek archon, &quot;prince,&quot; &quot;ruler,&quot; is rendered by the King James Version &quot;chief,&quot; by the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;prince,&quot; in Lu 11:15; the King James Version &quot;chief Pharisees,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;rulers of the Pharisees,&quot; in Lu 14:1.The original meaning of &quot;chief&quot; having been weakened, the comparative and superlative were admitted into English, the latter only appearing in the King James Version or the Revised Version: 1Sa 2:29; So 5:10; 2Co 11:5, etc. On &quot;chief of Asia&quot; (Ac 19:31 the King James Version) see ASIARCH.F.

These were special seats set in front of the ark containing the Scriptures and of the reader&#x27;s platform, and facing the congregation.

The reference is to the calling of woman as wife and mother, as her ordinary lot in life, and to the anxieties, pains and perils of maternity, as the culmination and representation of the penalties woman has incurred because of the Fall (Ge 3:16). &quot;She shall be saved by keeping faithfully and simply to her allotted sphere as wife and mother&quot; (Dummelow). The preposition dia is not used here instrumentally, as though child-bearing were a means of her salvation, but locally, as in 1Co 3:15, &quot;saved so as through fire,&quot; where life is saved by rushing through the flames. The explanation by reference to the incarnation, with an appeal to Ga 4:4, favored by Ellicott and others, seems very mechanical.H. E. Jacobs</p>

The birth of a male child was especially a cause for rejoicing (Ps 128:3, Hebrew); more men, more defenders for the tribe. If there were no sons born to a household, that family or branch became lost. If the wife proved childless, other wife or wives might be added to the family (Ge 16 f). Further, each Jewish mother, at least in later times, hoped that her son might prove to be the Messiah. The custom of Levirate marriage, which was not limited to the Hebrew people, rested on the principle that if a man died childless his brother should marry his widow, the children of such union being considered as belonging to the brother whose name and line were thus preserved from extinction (De 25:5; Ge 38:26; Mt 22:24).Children were sometimes dedicated to God, even before their birth (1Sa 1:11). Names often were significant: Moses (Ex 2:10); Samuel (1Sa 1:20); Ichabod (1Sa 4:21; compare Ge 30) (see PROPER NAMES). The firstborn son belonged to God (Nu 3:44 ff). The ceremony of redeeming the firstborn occurred on the thirtieth day. Friends of the family were invited to a feast, the rabbi also being present. The child was placed in the hands of the priest. The father carried some gold or silver in a cup or vessel. The priest asked the mother whether this was her firstborn, and, on being answered in the affirmative, claimed the child as Yahweh&#x27;s. The father offered the redemption money, which was accepted in exchange for the child (compare 1Pe 1:18). See FIRSTBORN. Other stages in the life of the child were celebrated with fitting ceremonies. In the fourth year, in Palestine, on the second day of the Passover occurred the ceremony of the first cutting of the boy&#x27;s hair, the friends sharing the privilege. Sometimes, as in the case of the wealthy, the weight of the child in currency was given as a donation to the poor. In common with the custom of other eastern peoples, male children were circumcised (Ge 17:12), the rite being performed on the eighth day.Early education was cared for in the home, the children growing up more or less with the mother (Pr 6:20; 31:1; 2Ti 1:5; 3:14,15), and the girl continuing with her mother until her marriage. In wealthier families tutors were employed (1Ch 27:32). Schools for children are first mentioned by Josephus (Ant., XV, x, 5). According to the Talmud the first school for children was established about 100 BC, but in the time of Jesus such schools were common. Children were taught to read and to write even in families of moderate means, these arts being widely diffused as early as 600 BC, if not earlier (Isa 8:1; 10:19). Great stress was laid on the Torah, i.e. the law of Moses. Boys were trained also in farming, the tending of cattle, and in the trades. The religious training of the bo...</p>

The expression, &quot;the children of Eden that were in Telassar,&quot; undoubtedly referred to a tribe which inhabited a region of which Telassar was the center. Telassar means &quot;the hill of Asshur&quot; and, according to Schrader, it was a name that might have been given to any place where a temple had been built to Asshur. Inasmuch as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph were in Mesopotamia it would seem probable that &quot;the children of Eden that were in Telassar&quot; belonged to the same locality. The &quot;children of Eden&quot; is quite probably to be identified with the Bit `Adini of the inscriptions and this referred to a district on the middle Euphrates. According to the inscriptions Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and Bit `Adini were destroyed by Sennacherib&#x27;s forefathers, and this is in accord with the account in 2 Kings and Isaiah.The &quot;Eden&quot; of Eze 27:23 is usually taken as the name of a place in Mesopotamia with which Tyre had commercial relations, and probably belongs to the region of &quot;the chilrden of Eden,&quot; discussed above.Some writers think the &quot;Beth-eden&quot; of Am 1:5 the Revised Version, margin (the American Standard Revised Version &quot;Aven&quot;) is to be identified with the Bit `Adini of the inscriptions and hence, with &quot;the children of Eden,&quot; but this is doubtful.

Huioi, too, conveys the ideas of origin, and of personal relation, but the latter in the fuller form in which it appears in mature age. &quot;The difference between huios and teknon appears to be that whereas teknon denotes the natural relationship of child to parent, huios implies in addition to this the recognized status and legal privileges reserved for sons&quot; (Sanday and Headlam, on Ro 8:14). This difference obtains, however, only in a very general sense.The above phrases denote the relation in which men are conceived to stand to God, either as deriving their being from Him and depending upon Him, or as standing in that personal relation of intimate trust and love toward Him which constitutes the psychological fact of sonship. The exact significance of the expression depends upon the conception of God, and particularly of His Fatherhood, to which it corresponds. It therefore attains to its full significance only in the New Testament, and its meaning in the Old Testament differs considerably, even though it marks stages of development up to the New Testament idea.I. Old Testament Teaching.The most primitive form of the idea appears in Ge 6:1-4, where the sons of God by marrying the fair daughters of men become the fathers of the giants.1. Mythological Survivals:These were a subordinate order of Divine beings or demi-gods, and the title here may mean no more, although it was probably a survival of an earlier idea of the actual descent of these gods from a higher God. The idea of a heavenly court where the sons of God come to present themselves before Yahweh is found in quite late literature (Job 1:6; 2:1; 38:7; Ps 29:1; 89:6). In all these cases the phrase implies a certain kinship with God and dependence upon Him on the part of the Divine society around Him. But there is no evidence to show whether the idea of...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">iz&#x27;-ra-el (bene yisra&#x27;el): A very common term in both the Old Testament and the New Testament, and it refers to the Israelites as the descendants of a common ancestor, Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel (see Ge 32:24-32). It was customary to designate the members of the various tribes as the children of the one from whom the tribe originated (see Nu 1:20-43; Ezr 2:3-61), and it was natural that the people who boasted of Israel as their ancestor should be designated as his children. The first reference to the descendants of Jacob is found in the account of the changing of Jacob&#x27;s name to Israel, and the purpose is to connect them with the experience in Jacob&#x27;s life which led to the change in his name: &quot;Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob&#x27;s thigh in the sinew of the hip.&quot; At the time when this was written &quot;the children of Israel&quot; was a phrase that was commonly applied to the Israelites. In 2Ki 17:34 they are called &quot;the children of Jacob,&quot; and this occurs in connection with the account of the changing of Jacob&#x27;s name to Israel and is intended to connect them closely with their father Jacob, who was favored of God.After a time, it is quite likely that the phrase &quot;children of Israel&quot; lost its peculiar significance and was simply one of the popular terms designating the inhabitants of Palestine, but at first it was intended to connect these people with their ancestor Jacob whose name was changed to Israel. The Jews of the New Testament times connected themselves with Abraham rather than with Jacob (see Joh 8:39; Ro 9:7; Ga 3:7, tekna, or, huioi Abraam).A. W. Fortune</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">est (bene qedhem): A term which in a general way designated the inhabitants of the country East of Palestine The Hebrews thought of their own country as occupying the central place, and of the other parts of the world in relation to this. They spoke of the &quot;queen of the south&quot; (Mt 12:42), and of the &quot;king of the south&quot; (Da 11:5,6). They spoke of people coming from &quot;the east and the west&quot; and sitting down with the patriarchs (Mt 8:11).The term &quot;children of the east&quot; seems to have been applied to the inhabitants of any part of the country East of Palestine It is stated that Jacob, when he fled from Esau, &quot;came to the land of the children of the east&quot; (Ge 29:1), and the place to which he came was Haran in Mesopotamia. In Jer 49:28 the inhabitants of Kedar are called &quot;the children of the east,&quot; and in later Jewish literature, Kedar is identified with the Arabs (see KEDAR). Job was designated as &quot;the greatest of all the children of the east&quot; (Job 1:3), and the land of Uz was mentioned as his home (Job 1:1). While it is impossible absolutely to locate the land of Uz, it must have been on the edge of the desert which was East of Palestine. The children of the east seem to have been famous for their wisdom. It is said that &quot;Solomon&#x27;s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east&quot; (1Ki 4:30), and &quot;Wise-men from the east&quot; came to Jerusalem seeking the one that was born king of the Jews (Mt 2:1).Many of the inhabitants of the east country were regarded as descending from Abraham (see Ge 25:6), and hence, they were related to Israel.A.

His mother was Abigail, whom David married after the death of her husband Nabal, the Carmelite (2Sa 3:3). In the corresponding account (1Ch 3:1) he is called &quot;Daniel,&quot; the meaning of which name (&quot;God is my judge&quot;) points to its having been given in order to commemorate God&#x27;s judgment upon Nabal (1Sa 25:39; compare Ge 30:6). Some suppose that he bore both names, but the Septuagint reading here Dalouia (Ch Damniel), and the identity of the last three letters of the Hebrew word &quot;Chileab&quot; with the first three of the following word, seems to indicate that the text of Samuel is corrupt.Horace J.

With his mother and brother he came into Moab and there both married Moabite women, Orpah being the name of Chilion&#x27;s wife and Ru that of the wife of Mahlon (Ru 4:9,10).

When Boaz married Ru he &quot;bought all that was Elimelech&#x27;s, and all that was Chilion&#x27;s, and Mahlon&#x27;s, of the hand of Naomi&quot; (Ru 4:9).W. L. Walker</p>

By changing &quot;m&quot; into &quot;w&quot; (common in Assytoprian-Babylonian) this has been compared with Kalwadha near Bagdad (G. Smith, Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, I, 61; Delitzsch, Paradies, 206), but the identification seems improbable. Though regarded as the name of a country in the Septuagint and the Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 A. D.) (Charman; Chelmad), there is some doubt whether this view of the word is correct. The Targum substitutes Madhai, &quot;Media,&quot; and on this account Mez (Stadt Harran, 24) amends to Kol Madhai, &quot;all Media.&quot; The absence of the copula &quot;and&quot; has caused others to further modify the vocalization, and by reading kelimmudh instead of Chilmad, the sense &quot;Asshur was as the apprentice of thy trading&quot; (Qimchi, Hitzig, Cornill) is obtained, but is not satisfactory. Probably both text and translation are susceptible of improvement.T. G. Pinches</p>

After the death of Absalom, Barzillai was invited to spend the remainder of his life with the king; but he refused, and sent his son Chimham in his stead. From the mention of &quot;the habitation of Chimham, which is by Beth-lehem&quot; (Jer 41:17 the King James Version), it has been inferred that Chimham received a grant of land from David&#x27;s patrimony at Bethlehem, which retained his name for at least four centuries. It has been suggested that his name was probably Ahinoam (&#x27;achino`am).Horace J. Wolf</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ke&#x27;-os, ki&#x27;-os (Chios): An island belonging to Turkey in the Aegean Sea, South of Lesbos, and very near the mainland of Asia Minor. Paul&#x27;s vessel passed it on his last voyage to Jerusalem (Ac 20:15). The channel here is very picturesque. From Luke&#x27;s expression, &quot;we came the following day over against Chios,&quot; it has been conjectured that they were becalmed; more probably it simply means that, because of the dark moon, they lay at anchor for the night on the Asian coast opposite the island (Hastings Dictionary of the Bible, under the word). Herod, when on his way to Agrippa at the Bosphorus, &quot;continued many days at Chios&quot; and conferred many royal benefactions upon the inhabitants (Josephus, Ant, XVI, ii, 2).The soil is sterile (though well cultivated), the climate mild. Earthquakes are frequent. In the mountains (highest 4,000 ft.) beautiful blue marble with white veins, and excellent potter&#x27;s clay, were quarried in antiquity. In modern times large quantities of ochre are mined. The chief industry is the culture of the silkworm, the cocoons being sent to Lyons. Oranges, lemons, almonds, brandy, anise, mastich and leather are also exported. The inhabitants, who are almost entirely Greeks, number about 60,000. The capital, Castro, has a population of 15,000. The place where Homer is said to have collected his pupils around him is still pointed out to the traveler at the foot of Mt. Epos, near the coast. It is in reality (probably) a very old sanctuary of Cybele, the Mother of the Gods. The tragic poet Ion, the historian Theopompus and the sophist Theocritus were natives of Chios. The Chians were especially famous for their skill in telling stories, and for their levity. A familiar proverb says that &quot;it is easier to find a green horse than a sober- minded Sciot&quot; (Conybeare and Howson, XX, 549).The oldest inhabitants of the island were Leleges, Cretans and Carians, who were conquered by the Ionians. The latter made Chios one of the most flourishing states in Ionia. When the Persians overran Asia Minor and oppressed the Greek colonies, the Chians showed a Pan-Hellenic spirit. They surrendered, however, to Cyrus in 546 BC. Nevertheless, 46 years later they joined in the rebellion of Aristagoras against the Persians. In the naval engagement off the island Lade they fought with 100 ships and displayed great bravery. Again they fell into the power of Persia; but after the battle of Mycale (479) the Chians joined the Athenian confederacy. In 412 they sided with the Peloponnesians, in the 19th year of the war which Athens had been waging against Sparta and her allies. For this act of treason the Athenians devastated the island. At the end of the war the Chians revolted from Sparta and, after the battle of Naxos (376), became an ally of Athens once more. Oppressed now by Athens, as she had been by Sparta, Chios made an alliance with Thebes in 363 and defended herself successfully against the Athenian general, Chares; and in 355 Athens was forced to recognize t...</p>

The vowels represent an assimilation to some such word as shiqquts, &quot;detestable thing,&quot; or gillul, &quot;idol&quot; (properly &quot;a filthy thing&quot;), in consonance with the well-known habit of the punctuators (compare molekh, Molech with the vowels of bosheth, &quot;shame&quot;). The Syriac version has preserved the correct vocalization; apparently also the Septuagint, albeit the consonants have suffered corruption (so particularly in the Greek manuscripts of Ac 7:43). There can be no doubt that we should vocalize kewan = the Assyrian Kai(a)-wanu = Kaiamanu by which at least in late Babylonian Saturn was indicated. The passage in Amos refers to the Saturn worship which appears to have been in vogue in the prophet&#x27;s days. The Israelites shall carry with them into exile the images of their gods (render with the margin of the Revised Version (British and American): &quot;Yea, ye shall take up,&quot; etc.).

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">chok (pnigo, and its compounds): Is used in its primary sense of &quot;to strangle,&quot; or &quot;to suffocate,&quot; in describing the fate of the swine (Lu 8:33 the King James Version). The Revised Version (British and American) has &quot;drowned,&quot; but &quot;choked&quot; is the correct rendering of the Greek word.Figurative: It is used in the sense of &quot;to strangle&quot; &quot;smother,&quot; &quot;suffocate,&quot; as if by depriving of breath, in describing the fate of the young grain growing in the midst of thorns (Mt 13:7). The figurative is carried a little farther still in describing the way the word, planted in the heart, is overcome by the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches (Mt 13:22).A. W.

Election Corresponds to ExperienceThe words denote an act of comparison of two or more objects or persons, the preference and selection of one, or of a few out of a larger number for a certain purpose, function, position or privilege.I. In the Old Testament.1. Human Choice:For bachar and its derivatives: men choosing wives (Ge 6:2); Lot choosing the cities of the Plain (Ge 13:11); often of kings and generals choosing soldiers for their prowess (e.g. Ex 17:9; Jos 8:3; 1Sa 13:2; 2Sa 10:9; 17:1). The word bachar is often used for &quot;young men,&quot; as being choice, in the prime of manhood. The most important uses of bachar are these: of Israel choosing a king (1Sa 8:18; 12:13); of moral and religious choice: choosing Yahweh as God (Jos 24:15,22), or other gods (Jud 5:8; 10:14); the way of truth (Ps 119:30); to refuse the evil and choose the good (Isa 7:15,16); compare David&#x27;s choice of evils (2Sa 24:12).2. God Chooses King of Israel:A leading idea is that of God choosing Moses as leader (Nu 16:5,7; 17:5); the Levites to the priesthood (1Sa 2:28; 2Ch 29:11); Saul as king (1Sa 10:24), David (2Sa 6:21; 1Ki 11:34), Solomon (1Ch 28:5). All this follows from theocratic idea that God rules personally over Israel as His chosen people.3. God Chooses Jerusalem:A more important, but still subsidiary, idea is that of Yahweh choosing Jerusalem as the place of His habitation and worship (De 12:5; 20 other times, Jos 9:27; 1Ki 8:44,48; Ps 132:13; Zec 1:17; 2:12; 3:2). This was the ruling idea of Josiah&#x27;s reformation which was instrumental in putting down polytheistic ideas and idolatrous practices in Israel, and was therefore an important factor in the development of Hebrew monotheism; but it was an idea that Hebrew monotheism had to transcend and reject to attain its full growth. &quot;The hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father&quot; (Joh 4:21).4. Election of Israel:But the fundamental idea of choosing, which governs all others in the Old Testament, is that of God choosing Israel to be His peculiar people. He chose Abraham, and made a covenant with him, to give him the land of Canaan (Ne 9:7 ff): &quot;For thou art a holy people unto Yahweh thy God: Yahweh thy God hath chosen thee to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth .... because Yahweh loveth you, and because he would keep the oath which he sware unto your fathers&quot; (De 7:6-8). Historically this idea originated in the old conception of Yahweh as the tribal God of Israel, bound to her by natural and indissoluble ties (see GOD). But as their conception of Yahweh became more moral, and the idea of His righteousness...</p>

Its appearance there, however, shows that it must have been a place of some importance, and highly privileged by the ministry of Jesus. It was already deserted in the time of Eusebius, who places it 2 miles from Capernaum (Onomasticon, under the word). We can hardly doubt that it is represented by the extensive ruins of Kerazeh, on the heights to the north of Tell Chum. It is utterly desolate: a few carved stones being seen among the heaps. There are traces of a Roman road which connected the ancient city with the great highway between north and south which touched the lake shore at Khan Minyeh.  W. Ewing</p>

THE MESSIANIC BASIS OF THE THREEFOLD OFFICE OF THE LORDLITERATUREGeneral Titles of our Lord:This term has been used by theologians to describe the various characters of our Lord&#x27;s redemptive work. Many appellative and metaphorical titles are found in Scripture for Christ, designative of His Divine and human natures and His work: God (Joh 20:28); Lord (Mt 22:43,14); Word (Joh 1:1,14); Son of God (Mt 3:17; Lu 1:35; Col 1:15; 1 Joh 5:20); Firstborn from the dead (Col 1:18); Beginning of the Creation of God (Re 3:14); Image of God (2Co 4:4); Express Image of His Person (Heb 1:3 the King James Version); Alpha and Omega (Re 1:8; 22:13); Son of Man (Mt 8:20; Joh 1:51; Ac 7:56); Son of David (Mt 9:27; 21:9); Last Adam (1Co 15:45,47); Captain of Salvation (Heb 2:10 margin) ; Saviour (Lu 2:11; Joh 4:42; Ac 5:31); Redeemer (Isa 59:20; Tit 2:14); Author and Perfecter of Faith (Heb 12:2); Light of the World (Joh 8:12); Lamb of God (Joh 1:29,36); Creator of all things (Joh 1:3,10); Mediator (1Ti 2:5); Prophet (De 18:15; Lu 24:19); Great High Priest (Heb 4:14); King (Lu 1:33; Re 17:14; 19:16); Way, Truth and Life (Joh 14:6). These and many others express the mediatorial office of the Lord. As mediator, He stands between God and Man, revealing the Father to man, and expressing the true relation of man to God. The term (Greek mesites), moreover, signifies messenger, interpreter, advocate, surety or pledge in Ga 3:19,20, where a covenant is declared to be assured by the hand of one who intervenes. Thus the covenant is confirmed and fulfilled by Him who secures that its stipulations should be carried out, and harmony is restored where before there had been difference and separation (1Ti 2:5; Heb 8:6; 9:15; 12:24). Thus is expressed the purpose of God to redeem mankind by mediation.I. Christ&#x27;s Mediation Expressed in the Specific Offices.In presenting a systematic idea of this Redemptive Work of Christ by Mediation, Christian thought gave to it a harmonious character by choosing the most general and familiar titles of the Lord as the most inclusive categories expressive of the mode of Redemption. These were prophetic, priestly and...</p>

JudgmentThis term is given to that condition of blessedness, glory and dominion into which our Lord entered after the completion of His earthly career of humiliation and suffering, and which is to be regarded as the reward of His meritorious obedience, and the issue of His victorious struggle, and at the same time the means of His prosecution and completion of His work as Redeemer and Saviour of the world. The classic passage of Scripture, rich in suggestion, and the source of much controversy in the development of Christian theology, is Php 2:5-11. The word &quot;exalted&quot; of Php 2:9, huperupsoo, occurs only in this place in the New Testament and, like its Latin representative, is limited to ecclesiastical use. Compare Ro 14:9; Eph 1:19-23; 1Pe 3:21,22.Christ&#x27;s Exaltation includes His Resurrection, Ascension, Session at the right hand of God, and Advent as Judge and Consummator of the world&#x27;s redemption.I. The Resurrection.1. Its Glorification of Christ:The historic place and validity of this event will be found under other heads; our concern is with the event as it relates to the glorification of our Lord.(1) It revealed His power over death.(2) It confirms all His claims to Divine Sonship.(3) It attests His acceptance and that of His work by God.(4) It crowns the process of the redemption of the world.(5) It forms the beginning of that new creation which is life eternal, and over which death can have no power.(6) It is the entrance of the Son of God into the power and glory of the New Kingdom, or the restored Kingdom of the Sovereign Ruler of the Universe.The following Scriptures among many others may be consulted: Re 1:18; Ac 2:24; Ro 1:4; 1Co 15:20; Joh 5:25; Ro 4:25; Ro 6:4,5; Col 2:12; Php 3:10; Ro 6:9.2. Resurrection Body--Identity, Change, Present Locality:An interesting and important question arises in connection with Christ&#x27;s exaltation, relating to the nature of the body of the risen Lord. It was clearly identical with that of His natural life. It was recognized by the marks which were upon it: Lu 24:39,40; Joh 20:24-29. It received food: Lu 24:43 (compare Lu 24:30; Joh 21:12,13; Ac 10:41). Nevertheless it was changed. After the resurrection, it was not at once recognized: Joh 20:15; 21:7; Lu 24:31. It appeared under apparently new conditions of relation to material substance: Joh 20:19; Lu 24:36. It suddenly became visible, and as suddenly vanished. These facts suggest what reverently may be surmised as to its exalted condition. The apostle&#x27;s declaration as to the resurrection-body of the redeemed furnishes some hints: ...</p>

The Christian Attitude to the Name4. Was &quot;Christian&quot; the Original Form?5. The Christians and the Empire6. Social Standing of the Early Christians7. Christian Self-DesignationsLITERATURE1. Historicity of Ac 11:26:The word Christian occurs only three times in the New Testament (Ac 11:26; 26:28; and 1Pe 4:16). The first passage, Ac 11:26, gives the origin of the term, &quot;The disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.&quot; The older generation of critical scholars disputed the historicity of this statement. It was argued that, had the term originated so early, it must have been found far more frequently in the records of early Christianity; sometimes also that the termination -ianus points to a Latin origin. But there is general agreement now that these objections are groundless. The historicity of the Lukan account is upheld not only by Harnack, but by the more radical Knopf in Die Schriften des New Testament, edited by Johannes Weiss. In early imperial times, the adjectival termination -ianos was widely diffused throughout the whole empire. Originally applied to the slaves belonging to the great households, it had passed into regular use to denote the adherents of an individual or a party. A Christian is thus simply an adherent of Christ. The name belongs, as Ramsay says, to the popular slang, as indeed sect and party names generally do. It is only after a considerable interval, and very often under protest, that such names are accepted as self-designations.2. Of Pagan Origin:The name, then, did not originate with the Christians themselves. Nor would the Jews have applied it to the followers of Jesus, whose claim to be the Christ they opposed so passionately. They spoke of the Christians as &quot;the sect of the Nazarenes&quot; (Ac 24:5); perhaps also as &quot;Galileans,&quot; a term which the emperor Julian attempted later vainly to revive. The word must have been coined by the heathen population of Antioch, as the church emerged from the synagogue, and a Christianity predominantly Gentiletook its place among the religions of the world.3. The Christian Attitude to the Name:Perhaps the earliest occurrence of Christian as a self-designation is in Didache 12:4. In the Apologists and Ignatius on the other hand the word is in regular use. 1Pe simply takes it over from the anti-Christian judicial procedure of the law courts, without in any way implying that the Christians used it among themselves. There is every probability, however, that it was the danger which thus began at an early date to attach to the name which commended it to the Christians themselves as a title of honor . Deissmann (Licht vom Osten, 286) suggests that Christian means slave of Christ, as Caesarian means slave of Caesar. But the word can scarcely have had that fullness of meaning till the Christians themselves had come to be proud of it.According to tradition, Luke himself belonged to Antioch.

In Principle and Essence.1. Early Use of Term:Unlike &quot;Christian&quot; (the King James Version), the term &quot;Christianity,&quot; so far as is known, was first used by the Christians themselves, but does not occur in the New Testament. It is exactly parallel to Judaism (&quot;the Jews&#x27; religion&quot;), found not only in Ga 1:13,14, but in 2 Macc 2:21, etc. Our earliest authority for the word &quot;Christianism&quot; is Ignatius of Antioch. Christian is now a title of honor, and the Christian&#x27;s glory is &quot;to live according to Christianism&quot; (Ignatius, Ad magnes, 10).2. New Testament Implications: Messiahship--Resurrection--Redemption:  While, however, the name is foreign to the New Testament, the New Testament is by universal consent our most important source of information regarding the thing. Christianity arose out of the life and work of Jesus of Nazareth, who claimed to be &quot;the Christ.&quot; During Jesus&#x27; lifetime this claim was admitted by a circle of adherents, in whose view, afterwards, it was triumphantly vindicated by His resurrection from the dead. By resurrection He &quot;was declared to be the Son of God with power&quot; (Ro 1:4). With this was united from the first the recognition of Christ as the God-sent Redeemer, through whom has come to the world forgiveness, reconciliation with God and Divine spiritual power.Pauline Summaries.One of the oldest summaries of Christianity is that of Paul in 1Co 15:3,1: &quot;For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; .... and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures.&quot; Of similar purport are the apostle&#x27;s words in 2Co 5:18,19: &quot;God, who reconciled us to himself through...</p>

Christ&#x27;s Warnings:In His discourse on the last things, uttered by Him on the Tuesday of the week of His Passion, Jesus solemnly forewarned His disciples that many would come in His name, saying &quot;I am the Christ,&quot; who would deceive many; that there would arise false Christs and false prophets, who would show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect; that, therefore, if any man said to them, &quot;Lo, here is the Christ,&quot; or &quot;Lo, there,&quot; they were not to believe it (Mt 24:5,11,23-25; Mr 13:6,21-23; Lu 21:8).2. Early Notices:The warning was needed. De Wette, Meyer, and others have, indeed, pointed out that there is no historical record of anyone expressly claiming to be the Christ prior to the destruction of Jerusalem. This, however, is probably only in appearance (compare Lange, Commentary on Mt 24:3). Edersheim remarks: &quot;Though in the multitude of impostors, who, in the troubled time between the rule of Pilate and the destruction of Jerusalem, promised Messianic deliverance to Israel, few names and claims of this kind have be en specially recorded, yet the hints in the New Testament, and the references, however guarded, in the Jewish historian, imply the appearance of many such seducers&quot; (Jesus the Messiah, V, chapter vi; in 1906 edition, II, 446). The revolts in this period were generally connected with religious pretensions in the leaders (Josephus, BJ, II, xiii, 4--&quot;deceived and deluded the people under pretense of Divine inspiration&quot;), and, in the fevered state of Messianic expectation, can hardly have lacked, in some instances, a Mes sianic character. Judas of Galilee (Ac 5:37; Josephus, Ant, XVIII, i, 1, 6; BJ, II, viii, 1) founded a numerous sect (the Gaulonites) by many of whom, according to Origen (Hom on Lk, 25), he was regarded as the Messiah (compare DB, under the word). The Theudas of Ac 5:36, &quot;giving himself out to be somebody,&quot; may or may not be the same as the Theudas of Josephus (Ant., XX, v, 1), but the latter, at least, made prophetic claims and deluded many. He promised to divide the river Jordan by a word. Another instance is the &quot;Egyptian&quot; for whom Paul was mistaken, who had made an &quot;uproar&quot; (Ac 21:38; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;sedition&quot;)--one of a multitude of &quot;impostors and deceivers,&quot; Josephus tells us, who persuaded multitudes to follow them into the wilderness, pretending that they would exhibit wonders and signs (Ant., XX, viii, 6). This Egyptian was to show them that, at his command, the walls of Jerusalem would fall down (BJ, II, xiii, 5). Of another class was the Samaritan Dositheus, with whom Simon Magus was said to be connected (see refs to Eusebius, Origen, Hippolytus, Clementine writings, etc., in DB, under the word). He is alleged to have been regarded as &quot;the prophet like unto Moses,&quot; whom God was to raise up.3. Bar-Cochba:The most celebrated case of a false Christ is that of Bar-Cochba (to give the name its usual form), the leader of the ...</p>

Truthfulness and Historicity(1) Alleged Proofs of Untruthfulness(2) Truthfulness in the Various Parts17. The Values of the ChroniclesLITERATURE1. The Name:The analogy of this title to such English words as diary, journal, chronicle, is obvious. The title is one which frequently appears in the Hebrew of the Old Testament. It is used to denote the records of the Medo-Persian monarchy (Es 2:23; 6:1; 10:2), and to denote public records, either Persian or Jewish, made in late postexilian times (Ne 12:23), and to denote public records of King David (1Ch 27:24). But its most common use is to denote the Judahite and Israelite records referred to in the Books o f Kings as sources (1Ki 14:19; 15:7 and about 30 other places). The references in Kings are not to our present Books of Chronicles, for a large proportion of them are to matters not mentioned in these. Either directly or indirectly they refer the reader to public archives.As applied to our present Books of Chronicles this title was certainly not intended to indicate that they are strictly copies of public documents, though it may indicate that they have a certain official character distinguishing them from other contemporary or future writings. The Greek title is Paraleipomenon, &quot;Of Things that have been Left Untold.&quot; Some copies add &quot;concerning the kings of Judah,&quot; and this is perhaps the original form of the title. That is, the Greek translators thought of Chronicles as a supplement to the other narrative Scriptural books. Jerome accepted the Greek title, but suggested that the Hebrew title would be better represented by a derivative from the Greek word chronos, and that this would fit the character of the book, which is a chronicle of the whole sacred history. Jerome&#x27;s suggestion is followed in the title given to the book in the English and other languages.2. The Position of Chronicles in the Old Testament:In most of the VSS, as in the English, the Books of Chronicles are placed after the Books of Kings, as being a later account of the matters narrated in Kings; and Ezra and Nehemiah follow Chronicles as being continuations of the narrative. In the Hebrew Bibles the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah and 1 and 2 Chronicles are placed last. By common opinion, based on proof that is entirely sufficient, the three books constitute a single literary work or group of works, by one author or school of authors. It is co nvenient to use the term &quot;the Chronicler&quot; to designate t...</p>

The Synoptic Gospels, etc.14. Death of John15. Summary of DatesLITERATUREThe current Christian era is reckoned from the birth of Jesus and is based upon the calculations of Dionysius (6th century). Subsequent investigation has shown that the Dionysian date is at least four years too late. Several eras were in use in the time of Jesus; but of these only the Varronian will be used coordinately with the Dionysian in the discussion of the chronology of the life of Jesus, 753 A. U. C. being synchronous with 1 BC and 754 A. U. C. with 1 A. D.I. Chronology of the Life of Jesus.1. Birth of Jesus:Jesus was born before the death of Herod the Great (Mt 2:1 ff) at the time of a census or enrollment made in the territory of Herod in accordance with a decree of Augustus when Quirinius (Revised Version; Cyrenius, the King James Version) was exercising authority in the Roman province of Syria (Lu 2:1 f). At the time of Jesus&#x27; birth a star led the Magi of the East to seek in Jerusalem the infant whom they subsequently found in Bethlehem (Mt 2:1 ff). John the Baptist was six months older than Jesus (Lu 1:36) and he was born in the days of Herod (Lu 1:5; compare Lu 2:1) after his father, Zacharias, of the priestly course of Abijah, had been performing the functions of his office in the temple.(1) Death of Herod.The death of Herod the Great occurred in the spring of 750/4. (NOTE: The alternative numbers are BC or AD, i. e, 750 A. U. C. = 4 BC, etc.) He ruled from his appointment in Rome 714/40 (Ant., XIV, xiv, 4-5, in the consulship of Caius Domitius Calvinus and Caius Asinius Pollio) 37 years, and from his accession in Jerusalem after the capture of the city 717/37 (Ant.,. XIV, xvi, 1-3; BJ, I, xvii, 9; I, xviii, 1-3; Dio Cassius xlix.22; compare Schurer, GJV3, I, 358, note 11) 34 years (Ant , XVII, xviii, 1; BJ, I, xxxiii, 7-8; compare Schurer, op. cit., I, 415, note 167 where it is shown that Josephus reckons a year too much, probably counting from Nisan 1 and including partial years). Just before Herod&#x27;s death there was an eclipse of the moon (Ant., XVII, vi, 4). According to astronomical calculations an eclipse was visible in Palestine on March 23 and September 15, 749/5, March 12, 750/4 and January 9, 753/1. Of these the most probable is that of March 12, 750/4. Soon after the eclipse Herod put to death his son Antipater and died five days later (Ant., XVII, vii; BJ, I, xxxiii, 7). Sho...</p>

FROM THE EXODUS TO BIRTH OF ABRAHAMMain Points at IssueIX. FROM ABRAHAM TO THE CREATIONA Suggested InterpretationLITERATUREI. Introductory.1. Difficulties of the Subject:For evident reasons the student of Biblical chronology must meet many difficulties, and must always be severely handicapped. First of all, the Old Testament is not purely nor intentionally a book of history. Nor does it present a formulated system of chronology, its many numbers and dates being used principally with a view to the spiritual facts and truths with which the authors were concerned. We are not, therefore, to expect to find a perfectly arranged order of periods and dates, though happily for us in our investigation we shall indeed find many accurately dated events, frequent consecutions of events, and orderly success ions of officials; as, for example, the numerous genealogical tables, the succession of judges and the lists of kings.Furthermore, there is not to be found in the Old Testament one particular and definitely fixed era, from which all of its events are dated, as is the case in Christian history. The points of departure, or reckoning, are found to vary in different periods of the advancing history; being at one stage the Creation, at another the migration of Abraham, or the Exodus, or again the disruption of the kingdom. Ordinarily dates and all time-allusions are comparative, i.e. they are related to the reign of some contemporary monarch, as the vision of Isaiah &quot;in the year that king Uzziah died&quot; (Isa 6:1), or to some unusual occurrence, historical or natural, as the great earthquake (Am 1:1; Zec 14:5). Only occasional reference is found to some event, which marks an era-beginning; such as the Exodus (Jud 11:16,26; 1Ki 6:1).The general lack of uniformity among writers on Biblical chronology contributes further toward increase of the already perplexing confusion. It is almost possible to say that no two writers agree; and proposed harmonies are with each other most inharmonious. The two articles on Old Testament chronology in a recent work (Murray, Illus. Bible Dictionary, 1908), for example, are several hundred years apart at certain points. Wide diversity of opinion exists about the most prominent events, such as the call of Abraham and the age of his famous contemporary Hammurabi, the year of the Exodus, and the beginning of Solomon&#x27;s temple. Naturally there is less variance of opinion about later dates, some of which, e.g. the fall of Samaria and the destruction of Jerusalem, may be considered as fixed. ...</p>

In the Gospels2. In Acts3. In the Pauline EpistlesIV. THE NOTES OF THE CHURCH1. Faith2. Fellowship3. Unity4. Consecration5. PowerV. ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH1. The General and Prophetic Ministry2. The Local and Practical MinistryLITERATUREThe word &quot;church,&quot; which is derived from kuriakos, &quot;of or belonging to the Lord,&quot; represents in the English Versions of the Bible of the New Testament the Greek word ekklesia; Latin, ecclesia. It is with the signification of this word ekklesia as it meets us in the New Testament, and with the nature of the society which the word is there used to describe, that the present article is concerned.I. Pre-Christian History of the Term.Although ekklesia soon became a distinctively Christian word, it has its own pre-Christian history; and to those, whether Jews or Greeks, who first heard it applied to the Christian society it would come with suggestions of familiar things. Throughout the Greek world and right down to New Testament times (compare Ac 19:39), ekklesia was the designation of the regular assembly of the whole body of citizens in a free city-state, &quot;called out&quot; (Greek ek, &quot;out,&quot; and kalein, &quot;to call&quot;) by the herald for the discussion and decision of public business. The Septuagint translators, again, had used the word to render the Hebrew qahal, which in the Old Testament denotes the &quot;congregation&quot; or community of Israel, especially in its religious aspect as the people of God. In this Old Testament sense we find ekklesia employed by Stephen in the Book of Acts, where he describes Moses as &quot;he that was in the church (the Revised Version, margin &quot;congregation&quot;) in the wilderness&quot; (Ac 7:38). The word thus came into Christian history with associations alike for the Greek and the Jew. To the Greek it would suggest a self-governing democratic society; to the Jew a theocratic society whose members were the subjects of the Heavenly King. The pre-Christian history of the word had a direct bearing upon its Christian meaning, for the ekklesia of the New Testament is a &quot;theocratic democracy&quot; (Lindsay, Church and Ministry in the Early Centuries, 4), a society of those who are free, but are always conscious that their freedom springs from obedience to their King.II. Its Adoption by Jesus.According to Mt 16:18 the name ekklesia was first applied to the Christian society by Jesus Himself, the occasion being that of His benediction of Peter at Caesarea Philippi. The authenticity of the utterance has been called in question by certain critics, but on grounds that have no textual support and are made up of quite arbitrary presuppositions as to the composition of the First Gospel. It is true that Jesus had hitherto described the society He came to found as the &quot;kingdom of God&quot; or the &quot;kingdom of heaven,&quot; a designation which had its roots in Old Testament teaching and which the Messianic expectations of Israel had already mad...</p>

Independent (Autonomous) OrganizationsIII. EXTERNAL AUTHORITYIV. COOPERATIVE RELATIONSLITERATUREThe object here sought is to discover what kind of church government is mirrored in the New Testament. To do this with perfect definiteness is, no doubt, quite impossible. Certain general features, however, may clearly be seen.I. Approach to the Subject.The subject is best approached through the Greek word ekklesia, translated &quot;church.&quot; Passing by the history of this word, and its connection with the Hebrew words `edhah and qahal (which the Septuagint sometimes renders by ekklesia), we come at once to the New Testament usage. Two perfectly distinct senses are found, namely, a general and a local.1. The General Sense:Christ is &quot;head over all things to the church, which is his body ....&quot; (Eph 1:22); &quot;the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven&quot; (Heb 12:23). Here we have &quot;church&quot; in the broadest sense, including all the redeemed in earth and heaven, and in all ages (see also Eph 1:22; 3:10; 5:22-27; Col 1:24; Heb 12:23).2. The Local Sense:Here the Scripture passages are very numerous. In some cases, the word is used in the singular, and in others the plural; in some it is used with reference to a specified church, and in others without such specification. In all cases the sense is local.In Ac 11:26, it is said that Paul and Barnabas were &quot;gathered together with the church,&quot; where the church at Antioch is meant. In Ac 14:23, Paul and Barnabas are said to have &quot;appointed elders in every church,&quot; that is, churches which they had planted. In Re 2 and Re 3 the seven churches of Asia Minor are addressed. In Ac 16:5 we are told that the churches &quot;were strengthened in the faith.&quot; On the local sense see, further, Ac 8:1; 15:4; 16:5; 20:17; Ro 16:4; 1Co 12; 6:4; 11:16; Ga 1:2,22, and many other places.There are a few passages that do not seem exactly to fit into either of the above categories. Such, for example, are Mt 18:17 and 1Co 12:28, where it seems best to understand a generic sense. Such, also, are passages like Ac 9:31, and 1Co 10:32, where a collective sense best suits the cases.Church government in the New Testament applies only to the local bodies.II. Internal Order.With respect to the constitution and life of these New Testament churches, several points may be made out beyond reasonable doubt.1. Subjects of Admission:They were composed of persons who professed faith in Christ, and who were believed to have been regenerated, and who had been baptized. See Ac 2:41,44,47 (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;added to them&quot;); Ac 8:12; Ro 1:8; 6:4; 10:9,10; 1Co 1:2; Col 1:2,4; 1Ti 6:12, and others, where they are called &quot;saints,&quot; &quot;sons ...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">churl (kilay or kelay): The Hebrew word occurs only in Isa 32:5,7, in the latter verse in a form slightly modified so as to produce a pleasing assonance with the word immediately following. The word probably means &quot;crafty&quot; or &quot;miserly,&quot; both ideas being suitable to the context, though &quot;miserly&quot; accords with the setting in Isa somewhat better.In 1Sa 25:3 the Hebrew qasheh which means &quot;hard,&quot; &quot;severe,&quot; &quot;rough,&quot; is rendered &quot;churlish.&quot; In Saxon, churl, as the name for the lowest order of freemen, came to be used of persons boorish in manner. The rough and ill-mannered Nabal is aptly described as churlish.John Richard Sampey</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">si-lish&#x27;-i-a (he Kilikia): An important province at the Southeast angle of Asia Minor, corresponding nearly with the modern Turkish vilayet of Adana; enfolded between the Taurus mountains and the Mediterranean Sea, with the Amanus range on the East and Pamphylia on the West; chief rivers, the Pyramus, Sarus, Cydnus and Calycadnus. The character of Cilician history has been largely determined by the physical features of the province. It is divided by nature into a mountainous part to the West, called Tracheia, and a broad, alluvial plain, hot and fertile, toward the East, termed Campestris or Pedias. Cilicia has always been isolated from its neighbors by land by its encircling mountains, save for its two famous mountain passes, the &quot;Syrian Gates,&quot; which offer an easy road to Antioch and the South, and the wonderful &quot;Cilician Gates,&quot; which open a road to central and western Asia Minor. Through these passes the armies and the pilgrims, the trade and the travel of the centuries have made their way. Alexander was one of the most renowned leaders of such expeditions, and at Issus he met and shattered the power of the Persian empire.The early settlers of Cilicia are held to have been Semitic Syrians and Phoenicians, but in the still earlier days the inhabitants must have been Hittites. While few Hittite remains have been brought to light in Cilicia proper, the province was so surrounded by Hittites, and such important works of Hittite art and industry remain on the outskirts of the province, as at Ivriz, Marash, Sinjirli and Sakche Geuzi, that the intervening territory could hardly fail to be overspread with the same civilization and imperial power. See Professor John Garstang&#x27;s The Land of the Hittites.Cilicia appears as independent under Syennesis, a contemporary of Alyattes of Lydia, 610 BC. Later it passed under the Persian sway, but retained its separate line of kings. After Alexander the Seleucid rulers governed Cilicia from Antioch. The disturbances of the times enabled the pirates so to multiply and establish themselves in their home base, in Cilicia, Tracheia, that they became the scourge of the Mediterranean until their power was broken by Pompey (67-66 BC). Cilicia was by degrees incorporated in the Roman administration, and Cicero, the orator, was governor (51-50 BC).The foremost citizen of the province was Saul of Tarsus (Ac 21:39; 22:3; 23:34). Students or pilgrims from Cilicia like himself disputed with Stephen (Ac 6:9). Some of the earliest labors of the great apostle were near his home, in Syria and Cilicia (Ga 1:21; Ac 15:23,11). On his voyage to Rome he sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia (Ac 27:5). Constantinople and Antioch may be regarded as the front and back door of Asia Minor, and as the former was not founded till the 4th century, Asia Minor may be regarded as fronting during apostolic days on Antioch. Cilicia was intimately connected with its neighbor province on the South. The first Christian apostles and evangelists f...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">sur-kum-sizh&#x27;-un (mul, muloth; peritome): The removal of the foreskin is a custom that has prevailed, and prevails, among many races in different parts of the world--in America, Africa and Australia. It was in vogue among the western Semites--Hebrews, Arabians, Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Egyptians, but was unknown among the Semites of the Euphrates. In Canaan the Philistines were an exception, for the term &quot;uncircumcised&quot; is constantly used in connection with them. Generally speaking, the rite of circumcision was a precondition of the enjoyment of certain political and religious privileges (Ex 12:48; Eze 44:9); and in view of the fact that in the ancient world religion played such an important role in life, it may be assumed that circumcision, like many other strange customs whose original significance is no longer known, originated in connection with religion. Before enumerating the different theories which have been advanced with regard to the origin and original significance of circumcision, it may be of advantage to consider some of the principal references to the rite in the Old Testament.1. Circumcision in the Old Testament:In the account of the institution of the covenant between Yahweh and Abraham which Priestly Code (P) gives (Ge 17), circumcision is looked upon as the ratification of the agreement. Yahweh undertook to be the God of Abraham and of his descendants. Abraham was to be the father of a multitude of nations and the founder of a line of kings. He and his descendants were to inherit Canaan. The agreement thus formed was permanent; Abraham&#x27;s posterity should come within the scope of it. But it was necessary to inclusion in the covenant that every male child should be circumcised on the 8th day. A foreigner who had attached himself as a slave to a Hebrew household had to undergo the rite--the punishment for its non-fulfilment being death or perhaps excommunication. According to Ex 12:48 (also P) no stranger could take part in the celebration of the Passover unless he had been circumcised. In the Book of Jos (Jos 5:2-9) we read that the Israelites were circumcised at Gilgal (&quot;Rolling&quot;), and thus the &quot;reproach of Egypt&quot; was &quot;rolled away.&quot; Apparently circumcision in the case of the Hebrews was prohibited during the Egyptian period--circumcision being a distinctive mark of the ruling race. It is noticeable that flint knives were used for the purpose. This use of an obsolete instrument is one of many proofs of conservatism in religion. According to the strange and obscure account of the circumcision by Zipporah of her eldest son (Ex 4:25) the performance of the rite in the case of the son apparently possesses a vicarious value, for thereby Moses becomes a &quot;bridegroom of blood.&quot; The marriage bond is ratified by the rite of blood (see 4 below). But it is possible that the author&#x27;s meaning is that owing to the fact that Moses had not been circumcised (the &quot;reproach of Egypt&quot;) he was not fit to enter the matrimonial estate (see 3 below...</p>

In Ps 84:6 the cognate berakhah, is changed to &quot;blessing.&quot;In the New Testament &quot;well&quot; represents the two words: pege (Joh 4:6,14; in the Revised Version, margin &quot;spring&quot;; 2Pe 2:17; the Revised Version (British and American) renders &quot;springs&quot;), and phrear (Joh 4:11,12). &quot;Pool&quot; is kolumbethra, in Joh 5:2,4,7; 9:7,11.1. General:The efforts made to supplement the natural water supply, both in agricultural and in populated areas, before as well as after the Conquest, are clearly seen in the innumerable cisterns, wells and pools which abound throughout Palestine The rainy season, upon which the various storage systems depend, commences at the end of October and ends in the beginning of May. In Jerusalem, the mean rainfall in 41 years up to 1901 was 25,81 inches, falling in a mean number of 56 days (see Glaisher, Meteorological Observations, 24). Toward the end of summer, springs and wells, where they have not actually dried up, diminish very considerably, and cisterns and open reservoirs become at times the only sources of supply. Cisterns are fed from surface and roof drainage. Except in the rare instances where springs occur, wells depend upon percolation. The&#x27; great open reservoirs or pools are fed from surface drainage and, in some cases, by aqueducts from springs or from more distant collecting pools. In the case of private cisterns, it is the custom of the country today to close up the inlets during the early days of the rain, so as to permit of a general wash down of gathering surfaces, before admitting the water. Cisterns, belonging to the common natives, are rarely cleansed, and the inevitable scum which collects is dispersed by plunging the pitcher several times before drawing water. When the...</p>

On the contrary we have either kinura kai nabla or kithara kai psalterion.

The locality is first referred to in Ge 13:10, where it is said that Lot &quot;lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the Plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar.&quot; The word translated plain is kikkar, &quot;circle.&quot; In this ver, and in the 11th, as well as in 1Ki 7:46 and Mt 3:5, we have the full phrase &quot;circle of the Jordan.&quot; Elsewhere (Ge 13:12; 19:17,29; De 34:3; 2Sa 18:23) the word for &quot;circle&quot; is used alone with the article. Until recently the traditional view that this circle of the Jordan was at the south end of the Dead Sea was universally maintained. The arguments in favor of this view are:(1) The name of Sodom is preserved in Jebel Usdum--Usdum having the same consonants with Sodom; moreover, the name is known to have referred to a place in that region as early as the days of Galen (De Simpl. medic. Facult., 4,19) who describes certain &quot;salts of Sodom&quot; from the mountains surrounding the lake which are called Sodom.(2) Zoar seems to have been represented in the Middle Ages by a place which the Crusaders called Segore, and Arabic writers Zoghar. Under the name Zughar or Sughar the place is often referred to by medieval Arabian geographers as situated 1ø South of Jericho &quot;at the end of the Dead Sea&quot; and as a station on the route between the Gulf of Akabah and Jericho, two days&#x27; journey from Jericho. Ptolemy (v.17,5) reckons Zoar as belonging to Arabia Petrea. Eusebius (Onom., 261) describes the Dead Sea as lying between Jericho and Zoar. Josephus (Ant., I, xi, 4) makes the Dead Sea extend 580 stadia &quot;as far as Zoar of Arabia&quot; (Wars, IV, viii, 4). These references would locate Zoar at the base of the mountains just Southeast of the Dead Sea, and, as it was within easy reach of Sodom, from which Lot fled, would fix the Cities of the Plain in that locality. Jerome (Comm. on Isa 15:5) says that Zoar was in the borders of Moab.On the other hand, it is maintained that the &quot;kikkar of the Jordan&quot; lay North of the Dead Sea for the following reasons:(1) That is the region which is visible from the heights of Bethel whence Abraham and Lot looked down upon it (Ge 13:10), while the south end of the lake is not visible. But it may be answered that the phrase need not be limited to the actual region in sight, but may have included the whole known extension of the valley.(2) Zoar was said to be in range of Moses&#x27; vision from the top of Pisgah (De 34:1-3) whereas the south end of the Dead Sea is invisible from that point, on account of intervening mountains. But this description in De evidently is not intended to be limited to the points which are actually visible, but should be understood as describing the extreme limits of the land some points of which are visible in their near vicinity.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">sit&#x27;-i-zen-ship: All the words in use connected with this subject are derived from polis, &quot;city.&quot;1. Philological:These words, with the meanings which they have in the Bible, are the nouns, polites, &quot;citizen&quot;; politeia, &quot;citizenship&quot;; politeuma, &quot;commonwealth&quot;; sumpolites, &quot;fellow-citizen&quot;; and the verb, politeuo, &quot;to behave as a citizen.&quot; Each will be considered more fully in its proper place.2. Civil:(1) The word for citizen is sometimes used to indicate little if anything more than the inhabitant of a city or country. &quot;The citizens of that country&quot; (Lu 15:15); &quot;His citizens hated him&quot; (Lu 19:14). Also the quotation from the Septuagint, &quot;They shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen&quot; (Heb 8:11; compare Jer 31:34). So also in the Apocrypha (2 Macc 4:50; 5:6; 9:19).(2) Roman citizenship.--This is of especial interest to the Bible student because of the apostle Paul&#x27;s relation to it. It was one of his qualifications as the apostle to the Gentiles. Luke shows him in Ac as a Roman citizen, who, though a Jew and Christian receives, for the most part, justice and courtesy from the Roman officials, and more than once successfully claims its privileges. He himself declares that he was a citizen of Tarsus (Ac 21:39). He was not only born in that city but had a citizen&#x27;s rights in it.See PAUL; TARSUS.But this citizenship in Tarsus did not of itself confer upon Paul the higher dignity of Roman citizenship. Had it done so, Claudius Lysias would not have ordered him to be scourged, as he did, after having learned that he was a citizen of Tarsus (Ac 21:39; compare Ac 22:25). So, over and above this Tarsian citizenship, was the Roman one, which availed for him not in one city only, but throughout the Roman world and secured for him everywhere certain great immunities and rights. Precisely what all of these were we are not certain, but we know that, by the Valerian and Porcian laws, exemption from shameful punishments, such as scourging with rods or whips, and especially crucifixion, was secured to every Roman citizen; also the right of appeal to the emperor with certain limitations. This sanctity of person had become almost a part of their religion, so that any violation was esteemed a sacrilege. Cicero&#x27;s oration against Verres indicates the almost fanatical extreme to which this feeling had been carried. Yet Paul had been thrice beaten with rods, and five times received from the Jews forty stripes save one (2Co 11:24,25). Perhaps it was as at Philippi before he made known his citizenship (Ac 16:22,23), or the Jews had the right to whip those who came before their own tribunals. Roman citizenship included also the right of appeal to the emperor in all cases, after sentence had been passed, and no needless impediment must be interposed against a trial. Furthermore, the citizen had the right to be sent to Rome for trial before the emperor himself, when charged with capital offenses (Ac 16:37; 22:25-29; 25:11).How then had Paul, a Jew, acquired this valued dig...</p>

LEVITICAL CITIESLITERATUREI. The Canaanite City.1. Origin:The development of the Canaanite city has been traced by Macalister in his report on the excavation at Gezer (Palestine Exploration Fund Statement, 1904, 108 ff). It originated on the slopes of a bare rocky spur, in which the Neolithic Troglodytes quarried their habitations out of the solid rock, the stones therefrom being used to form a casing to the earthen ramparts, with which the site was afterwards surrounded and which served as a protection against the intrusion of enemies. Later Semitic intruders occupied the site, stone houses were built, and high stone defense walls were substituted for the earthen stone-cased ramparts. These later walls were much higher and stronger than those of the Neilithic occupation and were the walls seen by the Israelites when they viewed the country of their promise.2. Extent:&quot;The people that dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified, and very great&quot; (Nu 13:28) was the report of the spies sent by Moses to spy out the land of Canaan, to see &quot;what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds&quot; (Nu 13:19,20). The difficulties of the task set before the advancing Israelites and their appreciation of the strength of the cities, is here recorded, and also in De 1:28: &quot;The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.&quot; This assessment of greatness was based upon comparative ignorance of such fortifications and the want of war experience and the necessary implements of assault. It need not, therefore, be supposed that the cities were &quot;great&quot; except by comparison in the eyes of a tent- dwelling and pastoral people. On the contrary, most recent exploration has proved that they were small (see Pere Vincent, Canaan, 27, note 3, and Pl. I, where comparative measurements of the areas of ancient cities show that, in nine cities compared, Tell Sandahannah (barely 6 acres) is the smallest). Gezer measures approximately 22 1/4 acres and Tell el-Hesy somewhat greater. By way of illustration, it is interesting to note that the Acropolis at Athens, roughly computed, measures 7:1/4 acres, while the Castle Rock at Edinburgh is about 6 acres, or the same as the whole Seleucidan city of Tell Sandahannah. The Acropolis at Tell Zakariya measures about 2 acres or nearly one-fourth of the area of the whole city (about 8 1/2 acres). It is unlikely that Jebus (Jerusalem) itself was an exception, although in Solomonic and later times it extended to a far greater area.3. Villages:Besides the walled cities there were &quot;unwalled (country) towns a great many&quot; (De 3:5), &quot;villages,&quot; unfortified subu...</p>

The term distinguishes the magistrates of a free Greek city from the ordinary Roman officials. It primarily denotes &quot;rulers of the citizens,&quot; and hence, was used only of magistrates of free cities. The term seems to have been confined largely to Macedonia, although there have been found a few inscriptions elsewhere in which it is used. The use of this term well illustrates the accuracy of the author of the Book of Acts, for while politarchai is not used by classical authors, this form is attested by a number of Macedonian inscriptions. Much work has been done in this field in recent years and the results throw light on the reference in Acts. Of the inscriptions that have been found at least five belong to Thessalonica (see article by Professor Burton, in the American Journal of Theology of 1898, &quot;The Politarchs&quot;).&quot;The rulers&quot; of Philippi, before whom Paul and Silas were brought is the English Versions of the Bible rendering of archonies, which is commonly used in the New Testament (Ac 16:19). This is the ordinary term for &quot;rulers&quot; and is not the same as &quot;rulers of the city.&quot;A. W. Fortune</p>

In each of these passages the King James Version renders &quot;taches&quot;--an early English word of French origin now embodied in our &quot;attachment.&quot; 50 clasps or taches of gold were ordered to be used in connecting together the two sets of inner tapestry curtains (10 in number) of the tabernacle (Ex 26:6), and 50 clasps of brass (bronze) were similarly to be used in joining the two sets of goats&#x27; hair curtains (11 in number) which formed the outer covering (Ex 26:11). See TABERNACLE. As to the nature of the clasp itself, it seems to have belonged to a double set of loops, opposite to each other, to one of which in each set, required to be of blue cord, a gold or brass button or pin was attached, which, being inserted into the loop opposite, kept the curtain in position (Ex 26:4-6).A difficulty arises from the direction in Ex 26:33 that the veil which divided the &quot;dwelling&quot; into two parts--the holy place and the most holy--was to be suspended &quot;under the clasps.&quot; If the clasps are supposed to be midway in the total length of the tabernacle, this would make the two holy places to be of equal size, contrary to the usual assumption that the outer was twice the length of the inner. The term &quot;under&quot; must therefore be used with some latitude, or the ordinary conception of the arrangement of the curtains, or of the size of the holy places will have to be revised (the dimensions are not actually given in the description).W.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">klo&#x27;-di-a (Klaudia): A member of the Christian congregation at Rome, who, with other members of that church, sends her greetings, through Paul, to Timothy (2Ti 4:21). More than this concerning her cannot be said with certainty. The Apostolical Constitutions (VII, 21) name her as the mother of Linus, mentioned subsequently by Irenaeus and Eusebius as bishop of Rome. An ingenious theory has been proposed, upon the basis of the mention of Claudia and Pudens as husband and wife in an epigram of Martial, that they are identical with the persons of the same name here mentioned. A passage in the Agricola of Tacitus and an inscription found in Chichester, England, have been used in favor of the further statement that this Claudia was a daughter of a British king, Cogidubnus. See argument by Alford in the Prolegomena to 2Ti in his Greek Testament. It is an example of how a very few data may be used to construct a plausible theory. If it be true, the contrast between their two friends, the apostle Paul, on the one hand, and the licentious poet, Martial, on the other, is certainly unusual. If in 2Ti 4:21, Pudens and Claudia be husband and wife, it is difficult to explain how Linus occurs between them. See argument against this in Lightfoot, The Apostolic Fathers.H. E. Jacobs</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">klo&#x27;-di-us (Klaudios): Fourth Roman emperor. He reigned for over 13 years (41-54 AD), having succeeded Caius (Caligula) who had seriously altered the conciliatory policy of his predecessors regarding the Jews and, considering himself a real and corporeal god, had deeply offended the Jews by ordering a statue of himself to be placed in the temple of Jerusalem, as Antiochus Epiphanes had done with the statue of Zeus in the days of the Maccabees (2 Macc 6:2). Claudius reverted to the policy of Augustus and Tiberius and marked the opening year of his reign by issuing edicts in favor of the Jews (Ant., XIX, 5), who were permitted in all parts of the empire to observe their laws and customs in a free and peaceable manner, special consideration being given to the Jews of Alexandria who were to enjoy without molestation all their ancient rights and privileges. The Jews of Rome, however, who had become very numerous, were not allowed to hold assemblages there (Dio LX, vi, 6), an enactment in full correspondence with the general policy of Augustus regarding Judaism in the West. The edicts mentioned were largely due to the intimacy of Claudius with Herod Agrippa, grandson of Herod the Great, who had been living in Rome and had been in some measure instrumental in securing the succession for Claudius. As a reward for this service, the Holy Land had a king once more. Judea was added to the tetrarchies of Philip and Antipas; and Herod Agrippa I was made ruler over the wide territory which had been governed by his grandfather. The Jews&#x27; own troubles during the reign of Caligula had given &quot;rest&quot; (the American Standard Revised Version &quot;peace&quot;) to the churches &quot;throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria&quot; (Ac 9:31). But after the settlement of these troubles, &quot;Herod the king put forth his hands to afflict certain of the church&quot; (Ac 12:1). He slew one apostle and &quot;when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize&quot; another (Ac 12:3). His miserable death is recorded in Ac 12:20-23, and in Ant, XIX, 8. This event which took place in the year 44 AD is held to have been coincident with one of the visits of Paul to Jerusalem. It has proved one of the chronological pivots of the apostolic history.Whatever concessions to the Jews Claudius may have been induced out of friendship for Herod Agrippa to make at the beginning of his reign, Suetonius records (Claud. chapter 25) &quot;Judaeos impulsore Chresto assidue tumultuantes Roma expulit,&quot; an event assigned by some to the year 50 AD, though others suppose it to have taken place somewhat later. Among the Jews thus banished from Rome were Aquila and Priscilla with whom Paul became associated at Corinth (Ac 18:2). With the reign of Claudius is also associated the famine which was foretold by Agabus (Ac 11:28). Classical writers also report that the reign of Claudius was, from bad harvest or other causes, a period of general distress and scarcity over the whole world (Dio LX, 11; Suet. Claud. xviii; Tac.

Lysias, who was probably a Greek by birth (compare Ac 21:37), and who had probably assumed the Roman forename Claudius (Ac 23:26) when he purchased the citizenship (Ac 22:28), was a military tribune or chiliarch (i.e. leader of 1,000 men) in command of the garrison stationed in the castle overlooking the temple at Jerusalem. Upon learning of the riot instigated by the Asiatic Jews, he hastened down with his soldiers, and succeeded in rescuing Paul from the hands of the mob. As Paul was the apparent malefactor, Lysias bound him with two chains, and demanded to know who he was, and what was the cause of the disturbance. Failing amid the general tumult to get any satisfactory reply, he conducted Paul to the castle, and there questioned him as to whether he was the &quot;Egyptian,&quot; an postor that had lately been defeated by Felix (Josephus, BJ, II, xiii, 5; Ant, XX, viii, 6). Upon receiving the answer of Paul that he was a &quot;Jew of Tarsus,&quot; he gave him permission to address the people from the stairs which connected the castle and the temple. As the speech of Paul had no pacifying effect, Lysias purposed examining him by scourging; but on learning that his prisoner was a Roman citizen, he desisted from the attempt and released him from his bonds. The meeting of the Sanhedrin which Lysias then summoned also ended in an uproar, and having rescued Paul with difficulty he conducted him back to the castle. The news of the plot against the life of one whom he now knew to be a Roman citizen decided for Lysias that he could not hope to cope alone with so grave a situation. He therefore dispatched Paul under the protection of a bodyguard to Felix at Caesarea, along with a letter explaining the circumstances (Ac 23:26-30. The genuineness of this letter has been questioned by some, but without sufficient reason.) In this letter he took care to safeguard his own conduct, and to shield his hastiness in binding Paul. There is evidence (compare Ac 24:22) that Lysias was also summoned to Caesarea at a later date to give his testimony, but no mention is made of his arrival there. It is probable, however, that he was among the chief captains who attended the trial of Paul before King Agrippa and Festus (compare Ac 25:22).

The Hebrew and Greek words, as well as the English &quot;clay,&quot; are, however, used loosely for any sticky mud. In making mud bricks, true clay is not always used, but ordinary soil is worked up with water and mixed with straw, molded and left to dry in the sun. Chomer (compare chmar, &quot;slime&quot; or &quot;bitumen&quot;) is rendered both &quot;clay&quot; and &quot;mortar.&quot; TiT is rendered &quot;clay&quot; or &quot;mire.&quot; In Isa 41:25 we have: &quot;He shall come upon rulers as upon mortar (chomer), and as the potter treadeth clay&quot; (TiT). In Na 3:14, &quot;Go into the clay (TiT), and tread the mortar (chomer); make strong the brickkiln&quot; (i.e. make the walls ready to withstand a siege). Chacaph is the clay of the image in Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s dream (Da 2:33 ff). MeleT occurs only in Jer 43:9, where we find: the King James Version, &quot;Take great stones .... and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln&quot;; the Revised Version (British and American), &quot;hide them in mortar in the brickwork&quot;; the Revised Version, margin, &quot;lay them with mortar in the pavement.&quot; In Hab 2:6, `abhTiT (found only here) is rendered in the King James Version &quot;thick clay,&quot; as if from `abhi and TiT, but the Revised Version (British and American) has &quot;pledges,&quot; referring the word to the root `abhaT, &quot;to give a pledge.&quot; In 1Ki 7:46, ma`abheh ha-&#x27;adhamah (compare 2Ch 4:17, `abhi ha-&#x27;adhamah) is the compact or clayey soil in the plain of Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan, in which Hiram cast the vessels of brass for Solomon&#x27;s temple.

The physical, ritual, ethical, spiritual, figurative uses continually overlap, especially the last four.1. Physical:The physical use is infrequent: &quot;Wash .... with snow water, and make my hands never so clean&quot; (zakhakh, Job 9:30; figurative also); &quot;clean provender&quot; (hamits, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;savory&quot;; the Revised Version, margin &quot;salted&quot;); &quot;Cleanse .... inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside thereof may become clean also&quot; (katharos, Mt 23:26); &quot;arrayed in fine linen, clean (katharon) and white&quot; (Re 19:8; the American Standard Revised Version &quot;bright and pure&quot;).2. Ceremonial:The principal use was the ceremonial; applied to persons, places or things, &quot;undefiled,&quot; &quot;not causing defilement,&quot; or &quot;from which defilement has just been removed&quot;; Taher, almost exclusively ceremonial, being the chief Hebrew root. Katharos (New Testament), or derivatives, has this use clearly in Mr 1:44; Lu 5:14: &quot;Offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses,&quot; etc.; Heb 9:13,12,23: &quot;the cleanness of the flesh,&quot; etc. &quot;Clean&quot; is applied to animals and birds: &quot;of every clean beast&quot; (Ge 7:2); &quot;of all clean birds&quot; (De 14:11); (for list of unclean creatures see Le 14-20); to places: &quot;Carry forth .... unto a clean place&quot; (Le 4:12); to buildings: &quot;Make atonement for the house; and it shall be clean&quot; (Le 14:53); to persons: &quot;A clean person shall take hyssop&quot; (Nu 19:18); to clothing: &quot;garment .... washed the second time, and shall be clean&quot; (Le 13:58); and to objects of all sorts, free or freed from defilement.3. Ethical or Spiritual:The ethical or spiritual meaning, either directly or figuratively, is found in the Old Testament chiefly in Job, Psalms, the Prophets, whose interest is ethico-religious, rather than ritual, but the predominant uses are found in the New Testament: &quot;Cleanse yourselves (barar) ye that bear the vessels of Yahweh&quot; (Isa 52:11); &quot;How can he be clean (zakhah) that is born of a woman?&quot; (Job 25:4) (principally moral, perhaps with allusion to the ceremonial defilement of childbirth); &quot;The fear of Yahweh is clean&quot; (Ps 19:9), that is, the religion of Yahweh is morally undefiled, in contrast to heathen religions; &quot;He that hath clean (naqi) hands, and a pure heart&quot; (Ps 24:4); &quot;Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean&quot; (Taher, Ps 51:7); &quot;Therefore said he, Ye are not all clean&quot; (katharos, Joh 13:11).

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">klenz: &quot;Make clean,&quot; &quot;purify&quot; being a frequent rendering of the original. It is found often (American Revised Version) instead of &quot;purge,&quot; &quot;purify&quot; (the King James Version), renders nearly the same roots, and has the same overlapping phases, as &quot;clean.&quot;1. Physical:Physical cleansing, often figuratively used: &quot;Stripes that wound cleanse away (tamriq) evil&quot; (Pr 20:30); &quot;A hot wind .... not to winnow, nor to cleanse&quot; (barar, Jer 4:11); &quot;Straightway his leprosy was cleansed&quot; (katharizo, Mt 8:3).2. Ceremonial:In the ceremonial sense:(1) With a very strong religious aspect: to purify from sin by making atonement (chaTe); e.g. the altar, by the sin offering (Ex 29:36); the leprous house (Le 14:48-53); the people, by the offering of the Day of Atonement (Le 16:30); the sanctuary, by the blood of the sin offering (Eze 45:18 ff).(2) To expiate (kaphar, &quot;cover,&quot; &quot;hide&quot;); sin (in this case blood-guiltiness): &quot;The land cannot be cleansed of the blood&quot; (the King James Version Nu 35:33; the American Standard Revised Version &quot;no expiation can be made for the land&quot;).(3) To remove ceremonial defilement, the principal use, for which the chief root is Taher: &quot;Take the Levites .... and cleanse them&quot; (Nu 8:6); &quot;and she shall be cleansed (after childbirth) from the fountain of her blood&quot; (Le 12:7); &quot;Cleanse it, and hallow it (the altar) from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel&quot; (Le 16:19), etc. This use is infrequent in the New Testament, except figuratively. Clear instances are Mr 1:44: &quot;Offer for thy cleansing (katharismos) .... for a testimony unto them&quot; (also Lu 5:14); Heb 9:22,23: &quot;necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these.&quot; Physical, ritual, and figurative uses are combined in Mt 23:25: &quot;Ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter.&quot; Ac 10:15: &quot;What God hath cleansed, make not thou common&quot; uses the figure of the ritual to declare the complete abolition of ceremonial defilement and hence, of ceremonial cleansing. For the elaborate system of ceremonial cleansing see especially Le 12-17, also articles UNCLEANNESS; PURIFICATION. Its principal agencies were water, alone, as in minor or indirect defilements, like those produced by contact with the unclean (Le 15:5-18, etc.); or combined with a sin offering and burnt offering, as with a woman after childbirth (Le 12:6-8); fire, as with Gentile booty (Nu 31:23; by water, when it would not endure the fire); the ashes of a red heifer without spot, mingled with running water, for those defiled by contact with the dead (Nu 19:2 ff). For the complex ceremonial in cases of leprosy, combining water, cedar, hyssop, crimson thread, the blood and flight of birds, the trespass offering, sin offering, burnt offering, see Le 14. Blood, the vehicle and emblem of life, plays a large part in the major cleansings, in which propitiation for sin, as well as the removal of ceremonial defilement, is prominent, as of the temple, altar, etc.: &quot;According to the law, I may almo...</p>

Noun, &quot;clearness,&quot; for brilliancy, in Ex 24:10, &quot;as the very heaven for clearness.&quot;From this physical, it is applied, in a moral sense, to character, as spotless and free from guilt, or charge, or obligation &quot;from oath&quot; (Ge 24:8); &quot;from transgression&quot; (Ps 19:13). Hence, the verb &quot;to clear&quot; means juridically to declare or prove innocent, to vindicate (Ge 44:16; Ex 34:7; Nu 14:18; compare hagnos, 2Co 7:11, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;pure&quot;) &quot;Be clear when thou judgest&quot; (Ps 51:4) refers to the proof and vindication of the righteousness of God.H.

The Psalmist speaks of Yahweh cleaving fountain and flood (Ps 74:15), and the plowman cleaving the earth (Ps 141:7). For other examples see Jud 15:19; Ec 10:9; Ps 78:15; Hab 3:9.(2) dabhaq; kollao, &quot;to adhere to,&quot; or &quot;to join one&#x27;s self to.&quot; This meaning is the reverse of the preceding. The Psalmist speaks of his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth (Ps 137:6). We are told that a man should cleave unto his wife (Ge 2:24; Mt 19:5). It is said that Ru clave unto her mother-in-law (Ru 1:14), and that certain men clave unto Paul (Ac 17:34; compare Ac 4:23; 11:23 margin).&quot;Cleave&quot; is also used in this sense to describe one&#x27;s adherence to principles.

Alexander was killed in battle against the joint forces of Ptolemy and Demetrius while Demetrius was in captivity in Parthia. Cleopatra married his brother Antiochus VII (Sidetes), who in the absence of Demetrius had gained possession of the Syrian throne (137 BC). She was probably privy (Appian, Syriac., 68) to the murder of Demetrius on his return to Syria 125 BC, but Josephus (Ant., XIII, ix, 3) gives a different account of his death. She afterward murdered Seleucus, her eldest son by Nicator, who on his father&#x27;s death had taken possession of the government without her consent. She attempted unsuccessfully to poison her second son by Nicator, Antiochus VIII (Grypus), for whom she had secured the succession, because he was unwilling to concede to her what she considered her due Share of power. She was herself poisoned (120 BC) by the draught which she had prepared for their son (Justin 39). She had also a son by Antiochus VII (Sidetes Antiochus Cyzicenus), who took his name from the place in which he was educated. He was killed in battle 95 BC. The name Cleopatra was borne by many Egyptian princesses, the first of whom was daughter of Antiochus III and was married to Ptolemy V (Epiphanes) 193 BC.J. Hutchison</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">klok, (me`il, simlah, etc.; himation, stole, etc.): &quot;Cloke&quot; is retained in the English Revised Version, as in the King James Version, instead of modern &quot;cloak&quot; (American Revised Version). In the Old Testament, me&#x27;il (compare New Testament himation) uniformly stands for the ordinary upper garment worn over the coat (kethoneth). In Mt 5:40 both &quot;cloak&quot; and &quot;coat&quot; are mentioned together; compare Lu 6:29. In size and material the &quot;cloak&quot; differed according to age and sex, class and occupation, but in shape it was like our mantle or shawl. It might be sewed up to have the surplice form of the robe of the Ephod (Ex 39:23), or be worn loose and open like a Roman toga, the Arabic Abaa, or the Geneva gown. This is the &quot;garment&quot; referred to in Ge 39:12; Ex 22:26; De 24:13; &quot;the robe&quot; that Jonathan &quot;stripped himself of&quot; and gave to David (1Sa 18:4); &quot;the robe&quot; of Saul, &quot;the robe&quot; in which it is said the &quot;old man&quot; (Samuel) was &quot;covered&quot; (1Sa 28:14); and in the New Testament &quot;the best robe&quot; put on the returning prodigal (Lu 15:22). Paul&#x27;s &quot;cloak&quot; that he left at Troas (2Ti 4:13; phailones, Latin, paenula, Westcott and Hort, The New Testament in Greek phelones), it has been suggested, &quot;may have been a light mantle like a cashmere dust-cloak, in which the books and parchment were wrapped&quot;(HDB, under the word).Figuratively: The word lent itself easily and naturally to figurative uses. We find Paul (1Th 2:5) disclaiming using &quot;a cloak of covetousness&quot; (compare 1Pe 2:16) and Jesus (Joh 15:22) saying, &quot;Now they have no excuse (&quot;cloak&quot;) for their sin.&quot; Some such usage seems common to all languages; compare English &quot;palliate.&quot;See DRESS.George B.

In 5:4 in contrast with unclothed, compare 1Co 15:53 f, in which the idea of putting on, as a garment, is expressed of incorruption and immortality. The meaning here is very subtle and difficult of interpretation. In all probability Paul thinks of a certain envelopment of his physical mortal body even in this life (&quot;in this we groan,&quot; i.e. in this present body), hence, the force of the prefixed preposition. The body itself was regarded by the philosophers of his day as a covering of the soul, and hence, it was to be clothed upon and at the same time transformed by the superimposed heavenly body. Ependutes, an outer garment, is used several times in Septuagint for me`il, an upper garment or robe (compare Joh 21:7).Walter G. Clippinger</p>

The term is also used to describe a Hebrew custom which indicated deep sorrow. Upon the death of a relative or important personage, or when there was a great calamity, it was customary for the Hebrews to tear their garments. Reuben rent his clothes when he found that Joseph had been taken from the pit (Ge 37:29). The sons of Jacob rent their clothes when the cup was found in Benjamin&#x27;s sack (Ge 44:13). A messenger came to Eli with his clothes rent to tell of the taking of the ark of God and of the death of his two sons (1Sa 4:12). David rent his garments when he heard that Absalom had slain his brothers (2Sa 13:31). See also 2Sa 15:32; 2Ki 18:37; Isa 36:22; Jer 41:5. Rending of clothes was also an expression of indignation. The high priest rent his garment when Jesus spoke what he thought was blasphemy (Mt 26:65).See also MOURNING.A. W. Fortune</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kloud (`anan, `abh; nephele, nephos):I. Clouds in Palestine.In the Bible few references are found of particular clouds or of clouds in connection with the phenomena of the weather conditions. The weather in Palestine is more even and has less variety than that in other lands. It is a long, narrow country with sea on the West and desert on the East. The wind coming from the West is always moist and brings clouds with it. If the temperature over the land is low enough the clouds will be condensed and rain will fall, but if the temperature is high, as in the five months of summer, there can be no rain even though clouds are seen. As a whole the winter is cloudy and the summer clear.1. Rain Clouds:In the autumn rain storms often arise suddenly from the sea, and what seems to be a mere haze, &quot;as small as a man&#x27;s hand,&quot; such as Gehazi saw (1Ki 18:44) over the sea, within a few hours becomes the black storm cloud pouring down torrents of rain (1Ki 18:45). Fog is almost unknown and there is very seldom an overcast, gloomy day. The west and southwest winds bring rain (Lu 12:54).2. Disagreeable Clouds:In the months of April, May and September a hot east wind sometimes rises from the desert and brings with it a cloud of dust which fills the air and penetrates everything. In the summer afternoons, especially in the month of August, on the seacoast there is apt to blow up from the South a considerable number of low cirro-stratus clouds which seem to fill the air with dampness, making more oppressive the dead heat of summer. These are doubtless the detested &quot;clouds without water&quot; mentioned in Jude 1:12, and &quot;heat by the shade of a cloud&quot; (Isa 25:5).II. Figurative Uses.1. Yahweh&#x27;s Presence and Glory:The metaphoric and symbolic uses of clouds are many, and furnish some of the most powerful figures of Scripture. In the Old Testament, Yahweh&#x27;s presence is made manifest and His glory shown forth in a cloud. The cloud is usually spoken of as bright and shining, and it could not be fathomed by man: &quot;Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through&quot; (La 3:44). Yahweh Himself was present in the cloud (Ex 19:9; 24:16; 34:5) and His glory filled the places where the cloud was (Ex 16:10; 40:38; Nu 10:34); &quot;The cloud filled the house of Yahweh&quot; (1Ki 8:10). In the New Testament we often have &quot;the Son of man coming on&quot; or &quot;with clouds&quot; (Mt 24:30; 26:64; Mr 13:26; 14:62; Lu 21:27) and received up by clouds (Ac 1:9). The glory of the second coming is indicated in Re 1:7 for &quot;he cometh with the clouds&quot; and &quot;we that are alive .... shall together with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord&quot; and dwell with Him (1Th 4:17).2. Pillar of Cloud:The pillar of cloud was a symbol of God&#x27;s guidance and presence to the children of Israel in their journeys to the promised land. The Lord appeared in a pillar of cloud and forsook them not (Ne 9:19). They followed the guidance of this cloud (Ex 40:36; Ps 78:14).3. Bow in Cloud:The clouds are spoken of in the...</p>

At the Southwest corner of Asia Minor there projects for 90 miles into the sea a long, narrow peninsula, practically dividing the Aegean from the Mediterranean. It now bears the name of Cape Crio. Ships sailing along the southern coast of Asia Minor here turn northward as they round the point. Upon the very end of the peninsula, and also upon a small island off its point was the city of Cnidus. The island which in ancient times was connected with the mainland by a causeway is now joined to it by a sandy bar. Thus were formed two harbors, one of which could be closed by a chain. Though Cnidus was in Caria, it held the rank of a free city. There were Jews here as early as the 2nd century BC.The ruins of Cnidus are the only objects of interest on the long peninsula, and as they may be reached by land only with great difficulty, few travelers have visited them; they may, however, be reached more easily by boat. The nearest modern village is Yazi Keui, 6 miles away. The ruins of Cnidus are unusually interesting, for the entire plan of the city may easily be traced. The sea-walls and piers remain. The acropolis was upon the hill in the western portion of the town; upon the terraces below stood the public buildings, among which were two theaters and the odeum still well preserved. The city was especially noted for its shrine of Venus and for the statue of that goddess by Praxiteles. Here in 1875-78 Sir C. Newton discovered the statue of Demeter, now in the British Museum. See also the Aphrodite of Cnidus in the South Kensington Museum, one of the loveliest statues in the world. From here also came the huge Cnidian lion. The vast necropolis West of the ruins contains tombs of every size and shape, and from various ages.E. J. Banks</p>

Coal, or more properly lignite, of inferior quality, is found in thin beds (not exceeding 3 ft.) in the sandstone formation (see GEOLOGY OF PALESTINE, under Nubian Sandstone), but there is no evidence of its use in ancient times. Charcoal is manufactured in a primitive fashion which does not permit the conservation of any by-products. A flat, circular place (Arabic beidar, same name as for a threshing-floor) 10 or 15 ft. in diameter is prepared in or conveniently near to the forest. On this the wood, to be converted into charcoal, is carefully stacked in a dome-shaped structure, leaving an open space in the middle for fine kindlings. All except the center is first covered with leaves, and then with earth. The kindlings in the center are then fired and afterward covered in the same manner as the rest. While it is burning or smoldering it is carefully watched, and earth is immediately placed upon any holes that may be formed in the covering by the burning of the wood below. In several days, more or less, according to the size of the pile, the wood is converted into charcoal and the heap is opened. The charcoal floor is also called in Arabic mashcharah, from shachchar, &quot;soot&quot;; compare Hebrew shechor. The characteristic odor of the mashcharah clings for months to the spot.In Ps 120:4, there is mention of &quot;coals of juniper,&quot; the Revised Version, margin &quot;broom,&quot; rothem. This is doubtless the Arabic retem, Retama roetam, Forsk., a kind of broom which is abundant in Judea and Moab. Charcoal from oak wood, especially Quercus coccifera, L., Arabic sindyan, is much preferred to other kinds, and fetches a higher price.In most of the passages where English versions have &quot;coal,&quot; the reference is not necessarily to charcoal, but may be to coals of burning wood. Pecham in Pr 26:21, however, seems to stand for charcoal:  &quot;As coals are to hot embers, and wood to fire, So is a contentious man to inflame strife.&quot;  The same may be true of pecham in Isa 44:12 and Isa 54:16; also of shechor in La 4:8.Alfred Ely Day</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kok (alektor; Latin gallus): There is no reference in the Old Testament to domesticated poultry, which was probably first introduced into Judea after the Roman conquest. See CHICKEN. The cock is several times mentioned in the New Testament and always with reference to its habit of crowing in eastern countries with such regularity as to be almost clocklike. The first full salute comes almost to the minute at half-past eleven, the second at half-past one, and the third at dawn. So uniformly do the cocks keep time and proclaim these three periods of night that we find cock-crowing mentioned as a regular division of time: &quot;Watch therefore: for ye know not when the lord of the house cometh, whether at even, or at midnight, or at cockcrowing, or in the morning&quot; (Mr 13:35). Jesus had these same periods of night in mind when he warned Peter that he would betray Him. Mt 26:34; Lu 22:34; Joh 13:38, give almost identical wording of the warning. But in all his writing Mark was more explicit, more given to exact detail. Remembering the divisions of night as the cocks kept them, his record reads: &quot;And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say into thee, that thou today, even this night, before the cock crow twice, shalt deny me thrice&quot; (Mr 14:30). See CHICKEN. It is hardly necessary to add that the cocks crow at irregular intervals as well as at the times indicated, according to the time of the year and the phase of the moon (being more liable to crow during the night if the moon is at the full), or if a storm threatens, or there is any disturbance in their neighborhood.Gene Stratton-Porter</p>

It is derived from the habit of the cock to crow especially toward morning.See COCK.</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">Pliny (see Oxford Dictionary, under the word &quot;Cockatrice&quot;) relates that the ichneumon darts down the open mouth of the crocodile, and destroys it by gnawing through its belly. In the course of time, as the story underwent changes, the animal was metamorphosed into a water snake, and was confused with the crocodile itself, and also with the basilisk. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th edition, the cockatrice was believed as late as the 17th century to be produced from a cock&#x27;s egg and hatched by a serpent, and &quot;to possess the most deadly powers, plants withering at its touch, and men and animals being poisoned by its look. It stood in awe however of the cock, the sound of whose crowing killed it. .... The weasel alone among animals was unaffected by the glance of its evil eye, and attacked it at all times successfully; for when wounded by the monster&#x27;s teeth it found a ready remedy in rue, the only plant which the cockatrice could not wither.&quot; The real ichneumon does kill the most deadly snakes, and has been supposed to resort to a vegetable antidote when bitten. It actually dies however when bitten by a deadly snake, and does not possess a knowledge of herbs, but its extraordinary agility enables it ordinarily to escape injury. It is interesting to see how the changing tale of this creature with its marvelous powers has made a hodge-podge of ichneumon, weasel, crocodile, and serpent.The Biblical references (the King James Version Isa 11:8; 59:5; Jer 8:17) are doubtless to a serpent, the word &quot;cockatrice,&quot; with its medieval implications, having been introduced by the translators of the King James Version.See SERPENT.Alfred Ely Day</p>

It is referred to in the Old Testament as Biq`ath ha-Lebhanon, &quot;the valley of Lebanon&quot; (Jos 11:17), a name the echo of which is still heard in el-Buqa`, the designation applied today to the southern part of the valley. This hollow, which extends about 100 miles in length, is the continuation northward of the Jordan valley. The main physical features are described under LEBANON (which see). The name, however, did not always indicate the same tract of territory. In Strabo (xvi.2) and Ptolemy (v.15), it covers the fertile land between Jebel esh-Sharqy and the desert presided over by Damascus. In 1 Esdras 2:17; 2 Macc 3:8, etc., it indicates the country South and East of Mt. Lebanon, and along with Phoenicia it contributed the whole of the Seleucid dominions which lay South of the river Eleutherus. Josephus includes in Coele-Syria the country East of the Jordan, along with Scythopolis (Beisan) which lay on the West, separated by the river from the other members of the Decapolis (Ant., XIII, xiii, 2, etc.). In XIV, iv, 5, he says that &quot;Pompey committed Coele-Syria as far as the river Euphrates and Egypt to Scaurus.&quot; The term is therefore one of some elasticity.W. Ewing</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">koinz: There were no coins in use in Palestine until after the Captivity. It is not quite certain whether gold and silver were before that time divided into pieces of a certain weight for use as money or not, but there can be no question of coinage proper until the Persian period. Darius I is credited with introducing a coinage system into his empire, and his were the first coins that came into use among the Jews, though it seems probable that coins were struck in Lydia in the time of Croesus, the contemporary of Cyrus the Great, and these coins were doubtless the model upon which Darius based his system, and they may have circulated to some extent in Babylonia before the return of the Jews. The only coins mentioned in the Old Testament are the Darics (see DARIC), and these only in the Revised Version (British and American), the word &quot;dram&quot; being used in the King James Version (Ezr 2:69; 8:27; Ne 7:70-72). The Jews had no native coins until the time of the Maccabees, who struck coins after gaining their independence about 143-141 BC. These kings struck silver and copper, or the latter, at least (see MONEY), in denominations of shekels and fractions of the shekel, until the dynasty was overthrown by the Romans. Other coins were certainly in circulation during the same period, especially those of Alexander and his successors the Ptolemies of Egypt and the Seleucids of Syria, both of whom bore sway over Palestine before the rise of the Maccabees. Besides these coins there were the issues of some of the Phoenician towns, which were allowed to strike coins by the Persians and the Seleucids. The coins of Tyre and Sidon, both silver and copper, must have circulated largely in Palestine on account of the intimate commercial relations between the Jews and Phoenicians (for examples, see under MONEY). After the advent of the Romans the local coinage was restricted chiefly to the series of copper coins, such as the mites mentioned in the New Testament, the silver denarii being struck mostly at Rome, but circulating wherever the Romans went. The coins of the Herods and the Procurators are abundant, but all of copper, since the Romans did not allow the Jewish rulers to strike either silver or gold coins. At the time of the first revolt (66-70 AD) the Jewish leader, Simon, struck shekels again, or, as some numismatists think, he was the first to do so. But this series was a brief one, lasting between 3 and 4 years only, as Jerusalem was taken by Titus in 70 AD, and this put an end to the existence of the Jewish state. There was another short period of Jewish coinage during the second revolt, in the reign of Hadrian, when Simon Barcochba struck coins with Hebrew legends which indicate his independence of Roman rule. They were of both silver and copper, and constitute the last series of strictly Jewish coins (see MONEY). After this the coins struck in Judea were Roman, as Jerusalem was made a Roman colony.H.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kold (qor; psuchros (adj.), psuchos (noun)): Palestine is essentially a land of sunshine and warmth.1. Temperature in Palestine:The extreme cold of northern latitudes is unknown. January is the coldest month; but the degree of cold in a particular place depends largely on the altitude above the sea. On the seacoast and plain the snow never falls; and the temperature reaches freezing-point, perhaps once in thirty years. In Jerusalem at 2,500 ft. above the sea the mean temperature in January is about 45 degrees F., but the minimum may be as low as 25 degrees F. Snow occasionally falls, but lasts only a short time. On Mt. Hermon and on the Lebanons snow may be found the whole year, and the cold is most intense, even in the summer. In Jericho and around the Dead Sea, 1,292 ft. below sea-level, it is correspondingly hotter, and cold is not known.2. Provision against Cold:Cold is of such short duration that no adequate provision is made by the people to protect themselves against the cold. The sun is always bright and warm, and nearly always shines for part of the day, even in winter. After sunset the people wrap themselves up and go to sleep. They prefer to wrap up their heads rather than their feet in order to keep warm. The only means of heating the houses is the charcoal brazier around which as many as possible gather for a little warmth. It is merely a bed of coals in an iron vessel. Peter was glad to avail himself of the little heat of the coals as late as the beginning of April, when the nights are often chilly in Jerusalem: &quot;Having made a fire of coals; for it was cold: .... and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself&quot; (Joh 18:18). There is no attempt made to heat the whole house. In the cold winter months the people of the mountains almost hibernate. They wrap up their heads in shawls and coverings and only the most energetic venture out: &quot;The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter&quot; (Pr 20:4, the King James Version &quot;cold&quot;). The peasants and more primitive people of the desert often make a fire in the open or in partial shelter, as in Melita where Paul was cast ashore after shipwreck: &quot;The barbarians .... kindled a fire .... because of the cold&quot; (Ac 28:2).3. Dread of Cold:The cold is greatly dreaded because it causes so much actual suffering: &quot;Who can stand before his cold?&quot; (Ps 147:17). The last degree of degradation is to have &quot;no covering in the cold&quot; (Job 24:7).4. Cold Grateful in Summer:In the heat of the long summer, the shadow of a rock or the cool of evening is most grateful, and the appreciation of a cup of cold water can easily be understood by anyone who has experienced the burning heat of the Syrian sun: &quot;As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country&quot; (Pr 25:25); &quot;cold of snow in the time of harvest&quot; (Pr 25:13), probably with reference to the use of snow (shaved ice) in the East to cool a beverage.Figurative uses: &quot;The love of the many shall wax cold&quot; (Mt 24:12); &quot;I know thy works, that ...</p>

Job, in describing his suffering and writhing, mentions the disfiguring of his garment, and suggests that the whole thing feels as narrow or close-fitting as the neckband, or perhaps that in his fever and pains he feels as if the neckband itself is choking him.(3) (tsinoq, Jer 29:26, &quot;stocks&quot;; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;shackles,&quot; which see; the Revised Version, margin &quot;collar&quot;).

Other words, such as bounty, contribution, blessing, alms, ministration, are used to indicate this same ministry. Paul seems to have ascribed to it great importance. Therefore, he planned it carefully long in advance; urged systematic, weekly savings for it; had delegates carefully chosen to take it to Jerusalem; and, in spite of dangers, determined himself to accompany them. Evidently he thought it the crowning act of his work in the provinces of Galatia, Asia, Macedonia and Achaia, for as soon as it was finished he purposed to go to Rome and the West (Ac 24:17; Ro 15:25,26; 2Co 8; 9).See also COMMUNION.

Roman colonies were of three kinds and of three periods:(1) Those of the early republic, in which the colonists, established in conquered towns to serve the state as guardians of the frontier, were exempt from ordinary military service. They were distinguished as(a) c. civium Romanorum, wherein the colonists retained Roman citizenship, also called c. maritumae, because situated on the coast, and(b) c. Latinae, situated inland among the allies (socii), wherein the colonists possessed the ius Latinum, entitling them to invoke the Roman law of property (commercium), but not that of the family (connubium), and received Roman citizenship only when elected to magistracies.(2) The colonies of the Gracchan period, established in pursuance of the scheme of agrarian reforms, to provide land for the poorer citizens.(3) After the time of Sulla colonies were founded in Italy by the Republic as a device for granting lands to retiring veterans, who of course retained citizenship. This privilege was appropriated by Caesar and the emperors, who employed it to establish military colonies, chiefly in the provinces, with various rights and internal organizations. To this class belonged Philippi. Partly organized after the great battle of 42 BC, fought in the neighboring plain by Brutus and Cassius, the champions of the fated Republic, and Antonius and Octavian, it was fully established as a colony by Octavian (afterward styled Augustus) after the battle of Actium (31 BC), under the name Colonia Aug. Iul. Philippi or Philippensis. It received the ius Italicum, whereby provincial cities acquired the same status as Italian cities, which possessed municipal self-government and exemption from poll and land taxes.See CITIZENSHIP; PHILIPPI; ROMAN.William Arthur Heidel</p>

In the New Testament the Greek prophasis, has the meaning of pretense or show (Ac 27:30; compare Re 17:4 the King James Version). The references to Joseph&#x27;s coat of many colors (Ge 37:3,13,12) and &quot;garments of divers colors&quot; (2Sa 13:18,19) probably do not mean the color of the garment at all, but the form, as suggested in the American Revised Version, margin, &quot;a long garment with sleeves.&quot; In Jud 5:30 the word for &quot;dip&quot; or &quot;dye&quot; appears in the original and has been so translated in the American Standard Revised Version. (see DYE). In 1Ch 29:2 riqmah, meaning &quot;variegated,&quot; hence, &quot;varicolored,&quot; is found. In Isa 54:11, pukh is used. This name was applied to the sulfide of antimony (Arabic kochl) used for painting the eyes. Hence, the American Revised Version, margin rendering &quot;antimony&quot; instead of &quot;fair colors&quot; (see PAINT). In Eze 16:16 Tala&#x27;, is found, meaning &quot;covered with pieces&quot; or &quot;spotted,&quot; hence, by implication &quot;divers colors.&quot;Although the ancient Hebrews had no specific words for &quot;color,&quot; &quot;paint&quot; or &quot;painter,&quot; still, as we know, they constantly met with displays of the art of coloring among the Babylonians (Eze 23:14) and Egyptians and the inhabitants of Palestine Pottery, glazed bricks, glassware, tomb walls, sarcophagi, wood and fabrics were submitted to the skill of the colorist. This skill probably consisted in bringing out striking effects by the use of a few primary colors, rather than in any attempt at the blending of shades which characterizes modern coloring. That the gaudy show of their heathen neighbors attracted the children of Israel is shown by such passages as Jud 8:27; Eze 23:12,16.Two reasons may be given for the indefiniteness of many of the Biblical references to color.(1) The origin of the Hebrew people: They had been wandering tribes or slaves with no occasion to develop a color language.(2) Their religious laws: These forbade expression in color or form (Ex 20:4). Yielding to the attractions of gorgeous display was discouraged by such prophets as Ezekiel, who had sickened of the abominations of the Chaldeans (Eze 23:14,15,16); &quot;And I said unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes&quot; (Eze 20:7).Indefiniteness of color language is common to oriental literature, ancient and modern. This does not indicate a want of appreciation of color but a failure to analyze and define color effects. The inhabitants of Syria and Palestine today delight in brilliant colors. Bright yellow, crimson, magenta and green are used for adornment with no evident sense of fitness, according to the foreigners&#x27; eyes, other than their correspondence with the glaring brightness of the eastern skies. A soapmaker once told the writer that in order to make his wares attractive to the Arabs he colored them a brilliant crimson or yellow. A...</p>

Cadmus, 8,013 ft. high. It stood at the head of a gorge where the two streams unite, and on the great highway traversing the country from Ephesus to the Euphrates valley, 13 miles from Hierapolis and 10 from Laodicea. Its history is chiefly associated with that of these two cities. Early, according to both Herodotus and Xenophon, it was a place of great importance. There Xerxes stopped 481 BC (Herodotus vii.30) and Cyrus the Younger marched 401 BC (Xen. Anab. i.2,6). From Col 2:1 it is not likely that Paul visited the place in person; but its Christianization was due to the efforts of Epaphras and Timothy (Col 1:1,7), and it was the home of Philemon and Epaphras. That a church was established there early is evident from Col 4:12,13; Re 1:11; 3:14. As the neighboring cities, Hierapolis and Laodicea, increased in importance, Colosse declined. There were many Jews living there, and a chief article of commerce, for which the place was renowned, was the collossinus, a peculiar wool, probably of a purple color. In religion the people were specially lax, worshipping angels. Of them, Michael was the chief, and the protecting saint of the city. It is said that once he appeared to the people, saving the city in time of a flood. It was this belief in angels which called forth Paul&#x27;s epistle (Col 2:18). During the 7th and 8th centuries the place was overrun by the Saracens; in the 12th century the church was destroyed by the Turks and the city disappeared. Its site was explored by Mr. Hamilton. The ruins of the church, the stone foundation of a large theater, and a necropolis with stones of a peculiar shape are still to be seen. During the Middle Ages the place bore the name of Chonae; it is now called Chonas.E. J. Banks</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ko-losh&#x27;-ans, ko-los&#x27;-i-anz: This is one of the group of Paul&#x27;s epistles known as the Captivity Epistles (see PHILEMON, EPISTLE TO, for a discussion of these as a group).I. Authenticity.1. External Evidence:The external evidence for the Epistle to the Colossians, prior to the middle of the 2nd century, is rather indeterminate. In Ignatius and in Polycarp we have here and there phrases and terminology that suggest an acquaintance with Colossians but not much more (Ignat., Ephes., x.3, and Polyc. x.1; compare with Col 1:23). The phrase in Ep Barnabas, xii, &quot;in him are all things and unto him are all things,&quot; may be due to Col 1:16, but it is quite as possibly a liturgical formula. The references in Justin Martyr&#x27;s Dialogue to Christ as the firstborn (prototokos) are very probably suggested by Col 1:15, &quot;the firstborn of all creation&quot; (Dial., 84, 85, 138). The first definite witness is Marcion, who included this epistle in his collection of those written by Paul (Tert., Adv. Marc., v. 19). A little later the Muratorian Fragment mentions Colossians among the Epistles of Paul (10b, l. 21, Colosensis). Irenaeus quotes it frequently and by name (Adv. haer., iii.14, 1). It is familiar to the writers of the following centuries (e.g. Tert., De praescrip., 7; Clement of Alexandria, Strom., I, 1; Orig., Contra Celsum, v. 8).2. Internal Evidence:The authenticity was not questioned until the second quarter of the 19th century when Mayerhoff claimed on the ground of style, vocabulary, and thought that it was not by the apostle. The Tubingen school claimed, on the basis of a supposed Gnosticism, that the epistle was the work of the 2nd century and so not Pauline. This position has been thoroughly answered by showing that the teaching is essentially different from the Gnosticism of the 2nd century, especially in the conception of Christ as prior to and greater than all things created (see V below). The attack in later years has been chiefly on the ground of vocabulary and style, the doctrinal position, especially the Christology and the teaching about angels, and the relation to the Ephesian epistle. The objection on the ground of vocabulary and style is based, as is so often the case, on the assumption that a man, no matter what he writes about, must use the same words and style. There are thirty-four words in Colossians which are not in any other New Testament book. When one removes those that are due to the difference in subject-matter, the total is no greater than that of some of the acknowledged epistles. The omission of familiar Pauline particles, the use of genitives, of &quot;all&quot; (pas), and of synonyms, find parallels in other epistles, or are due to a difference of subject, or perhaps to the influence on the language of the apostle of his life in Rome (von Soden). The doctrinal position is not at heart contradictory to Paul&#x27;s earlier teaching (compare Godet, Introduction to the New Testament; Paul&#x27;s Epistles, 440 f). The Christology is in entire harmony with...</p>

In most cases `ayir (compare Arabic `air, &quot;ass&quot;) means &quot;ass&#x27;s colt,&quot; but it may be joined with ben, &quot;son,&quot; as in Zec 9:9, where we have: `al-chamor we`al-`ayir ben-&#x27;athonoth, literally, &quot;on an epi onon kai epi polon huion hupozugiou&quot;, &quot;upon an ass, and upon a colt ass, and on an ass&#x27;s colt, the son of the she-asses&quot;; compare Mt 21:5 epi onon kai epi polon huion hupozugiou, &quot;upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.&quot; In Joh 12:15 we have epi polon onou, and in the previous verse the diminutive, onarion. The commonest New Testament word for &quot;colt&quot; is polos, akin to which is German Fohle and English &quot;foal&quot; and &quot;filly.&quot; The Latin pullus signifies either &quot;foal&quot; or &quot;chicken,&quot; and in the latter sense gives rise to French poulet and English &quot;pullet.&quot;In view of the fact that horses are but little mehtioned in the Bible, and that only in connection with royal equipages and armies, it is not surprising that &quot;colt&quot; does not occur in its ordinary English sense.Alfred Ely Day</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kum&#x27;-fert (nacham; parakaleo): The New Testament word is variously translated, as &quot;comfort,&quot; &quot;exhort,&quot; &quot;beseech,&quot; the exact translation to be determined by the context. Etymologically, it is &quot;to call alongside of,&quot; i.e. to summon for assistance. To comfort is to cheer and encourage. It has a positive force wanting in its synonym &quot;console,&quot; as it indicates the dispelling of grief by the impartation of strength. the Revised Version (British and American) has correctly changed the translation of paramutheomai from the King James Version &quot;comfort,&quot; to &quot;consolation.&quot; So in the Old Testament, &quot;Comfort ye my people&quot; (Isa 40:1) is much stronger than &quot;console,&quot; which affords only the power of calm endurance of affliction, while the brightest hopes of the future and the highest incentives to present activity are the gifts of the Divine grace that is here bestowed.H.

The beauty of the Hebrew term is illustrated in Ge 50:21 where Joseph &quot;spake kindly&quot; unto his brethren, winning them from fear to confidence. Rendered &quot;comfortably&quot; in five passages: thrice of human speaking, and twice of the tenderness of God&#x27;s address to His people. David was urged to win back the hearts of the people by kind words: &quot;speak comfortably&quot; (2Sa 19:7). Hezekiah in like manner comforted the Levites (2Ch 30:22) and encouraged his captains (2Ch 32:6). The term has exceptional wealth of meaning in connection with God&#x27;s message of grace and forgiveness to His redeemed people. The compassionate love that has atoned for their sins speaks to the heart (&quot;comfortably&quot;) of Jerusalem, saying &quot;that her iniquity is pardoned&quot; (Isa 40:2). The same promise of forgiveness is given to the penitent nation by the prophet Hosea (Ho 2:14); &quot;comfortable words&quot; (Zec 1:13), i.e. words affording comfort.Dwight M. Pratt</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kum&#x27;-fer-ter: This is translation of the word patakletos, in the Johannine writings. In the Gospel it occurs in Joh 14:16,26; 15:26; 16:7, and refers to the Holy Spirit. The word means literally, &quot;called to one&#x27;s side&quot; for help. The translation &quot;Comforter&quot; covers only a small part of the meaning as shown in the context. The word &quot;Helper&quot; would be a more adequate translation. The Spirit does a great deal for disciples besides comforting them, although to comfort was a part of His work for them. The Spirit guides into truth; indeed, He is called the Spirit of truth. He teaches and quickens the memory of disciples and glorifies Christ in them. He also has a work to do in the hearts of unbelievers, convicting the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment (Joh 14-16). The Comforter remains permanently with disciples after He comes in response to the prayers of Christ. The word parakletos does not occur elsewhere in the Scriptures except in 1Jo 2:1. In Job 16:2 the active form of the word (parakletos is passive) is found in the plural, where Job calls his friends &quot;miserable comforters.&quot; The word &quot;Comforter&quot; being an inadequate, and the word &quot;Helper&quot; a too indefinite, translation of the word in the Gospel of John, it would probably be best to transfer the Greek word into English in so far as it relates to the Holy Spirit (see PARACLETE).In 1 Joh 2:1 the word parakletos refers to Christ: &quot;If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.&quot; Here the translation Advocate is quite correct. As the next verse shows the writer has in mind the intercession of Christ for Christians on the basis of His mediatorial work: &quot;And he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world&quot; (1Jo 2:2).See ADVOCATE; HOLY SPIRIT; PARACLETE.E.

The term signifies bereft of a father, parents, guardian, teacher, guide, and indicates what must be the permanent ministry of the Holy Spirit to the disciples of Jesus, in comforting their hearts. In harmony with these parting words Jesus had called the chosen twelve &quot;little children&quot; (Joh 13:33); without Him they would be &quot;orphans,&quot; comfortless, desolate. The coming of the Holy Spirit would make Christ and the Father forever real to them, an abiding spiritual presence.Dwight M. Pratt</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">nu (entole kaine): The word &quot;commandment&quot; is used in the English versions of the Old Testament to translate several Hebrew words, more especially those meaning &quot;word&quot; (dabhar) as the ten words of God (Ex 34:28) or king&#x27;s &quot;command&quot; (Es 1:12); &quot;precept&quot; (mitswah) of God (De 4:2), of a king (2Ki 18:36); &quot;mouth&quot; or &quot;speech&quot; (peh) of God (Ex 17:1), of Pharaoh (2Ki 23:35). They express theocratic idea of morality wherein the will or law of God is imposed upon men as their law of conduct (2Ki 17:37).1. Christ and the Old Commandment:This idea is not repudiated in the New Testament, but supplemented or modified from within by making love the essence of the command. Jesus Christ, as reported in the Synoptics, came not &quot;to destroy the law or the prophets .... but to fulfill&quot; (Mt 5:17). He taught that &quot;whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven&quot; (Mt 5:19). He condemned the Pharisees for rejecting the commandments of God as given by Moses (Mr 7:8-13). There is a sense in which it is true that Christ propounded no new commandment, but the new thing in His teaching was the emphasis laid on the old commandment of love, and the extent and intent of its application. The great commandment is &quot;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, .... (and) thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments the whole law hangeth, and the prophets&quot; (Mt 22:34-40; Mr 12:28-34; compare De 6:5; Le 19:18).2. Principle instead of Law:Whey the law realizes itself as love for God and man in men&#x27;s hearts, it ceases to bear the aspect of a command. The force of authority and the active resistance or inertia of the subject disappear; the law becomes a principle, a motive, a joyous harmony of man&#x27;s will with the will of God; and in becoming internal, it becomes universal and transcends all distinctions of race or class. Even this was not an altogether new idea (compare Jer 31:31-34; Ps 51); nor did Christ&#x27;s contemporaries and disciples think it was.3. Christ&#x27;s Love Fulfilled in Death Becomes the Law of the Church:The revolutionary factor was the death of Christ wherein the love of God was exemplified and made manifest as the basis and principle of all spiritual life (Joh 13:34). Paul therefore generalizes all pre-Christian morality as a system of law and commandments, standing in antithesis to the grace and love which are through Jesus Christ (Ro 5-7). Believers in Christ felt their experience and inward life to be so changed and new, that it needed a new term (agape = &quot;love&quot;) to express their ideal of conduct (see CHARITY). Another change that grew upon the Christian consciousness, following from the resurrection and ascension of Christ, was the idea that He was the permanent source of the principle of life. &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot; (1Co 12:3). Hence, in the Johannine writings the principle described by the new term agape is associated with Christ&#x27;s lordship and solemnly described as His &quot;new commandment.&quot; &quot;A new ...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ko-mand&#x27;-ment (mitswah; entole): The commandments are, first of all, prescriptions, or directions of God, concerning particular matters, which He wanted observed with reference to circumstances as they arose, in a period when He spake immediately and with greater frequency than afterward. They were numerous, minute, and regarded as coordinate and independent of each other. In the Ten Commandments, or, more properly, Ten Words, EVm (debharim), they are reduced to a few all-comprehensive precepts of permanent validity, upon which every duty required of man is based. Certain prescriptions of temporary force, as those of the ceremonial and forensic laws, are applications of these &quot;Words&quot; to transient circumstances, and, for the time for which they were enacted, demanded perfect and unconditional obedience. The Psalms, and especially Ps 119, show that even under the Old Testament, there was a deep spiritual appreciation of these commandments, and the extent to which obedience was deemed a privilege rather than a mere matter of constrained external compliance with duty. In the New Testament, Jesus shows in Mt 22:37,40; Mr 12:29,31; Lu 10:27 (compare Ro 13:8,10) their organic unity. The &quot;Ten&quot; are reduced to two, and these two to one principle, that of love. In love, obedience begins, and works from within outward. Under the New Testament the commandments are kept when they are written upon the heart (Heb 10:16). While in the Synoptics they are referred to in a more abstract and distant way, in both the Gospel and the Epistles of John their relation to Jesus is most prominent. They are &quot;my commandments&quot; (Joh 14:15,21; 15:10,12); &quot;my Father&#x27;s&quot; (Joh 10:18; 15:10); or, many times throughout the epp., &quot;his (i.e. Christ&#x27;s) commandments.&quot; The new life in Christ enkindles love, and not only makes the commandments the rule of life, but the life itself the free expression of the commandments and of the nature of God, in which the commandments are grounded. Occasionally the word is used in the singular collectively (Ex 24:12; Ps 119:96; 1Co 14:37).See TEN COMMANDMENTS, THE.H. E. Jacobs</p>

So also the derivatives paratheke (2Ti 1:12) and parakatatheke (1Ti 6:20; 2Ti 1:14). See DEPOSIT. This sense of the English, while slightly archaic, corresponds to the first meaning of the Latin, whence it comes, &quot;to commit for preservation,&quot; especially of the dying; to commend children, parents, etc., to the care of others (for examples, see Harper&#x27;s Latin Dictionary).(2) For sunistiemi, &quot;to stand together,&quot; and then, by standing together, to establish, prove, exhibit, as &quot;righteousness&quot; and &quot;love of God&quot; (Ro 3:5; 5:8), and thus to attest (2Co 3:1; 4:2), and, finally, to certify or to recommend a stranger (Ro 16:1; 2Co 6:4). The use of paristemi in 1Co 8:8 is equivalent.(3) &quot;To praise,&quot; epaineo (Lu 16:8), and sunistemi in 2Co 10:12,18; for the Old Testament, Hebrew hillel, in Ge 12:15 the King James Version; Pr 12:8.H.

Recent Period(1) Germany(2) Britain and AmericaLITERATUREI. The Word--General Scope.Etymologically, a commentary (from Latin commentor) denotes jottings, annotations, memoranda, on a given subject, or perhaps on a series of events; hence, its use in the plural as a designation for a narrative or history, as the Commentaries of Caesar. In its application to Scripture, the word designates a work devoted to the explanation, elucidation, illustration, sometimes the homiletic expansion and edifying utilization, of the text of some book or portion of Scripture. The primary function of a good commentary is to furnish an exact interpretation of the meaning of the passage under consideration; it belongs to it also to show the connection of ideas, the steps of argument, the scope and design of the whole, in the writing in question. This can only be successfully accomplished by the help of a knowledge of the original language of the writing, and of the historical setting of the particular passage; by careful study of the context, and of the author&#x27;s general usages of thought and speech; and by comparison of parallel or related texts. Aid may also be obtained from external sources, as a knowledge of the history, archaeology, topography, chronology, manners and customs, of the lands, peoples and times referred to; or, as in Deissmann&#x27;s recent discoveries, from the light thrown on peculiarities of language by papyri or other ancient remains (see his Light from the Ancient East).II. Differences in Character of Commentaries.It is obvious that commentaries will vary greatly in character and value according as they are more scholarly, technical, and critical, entering, e.g. into philological discussions, and tabulating and remarking upon the various views held as to the meaning; or again, more popular, aiming only at bringing out the general sense, and conveying it to the mind of the reader in attractive and edifying form. When the practical motive predominates, and the treatment is greatly enlarged by illustration, application, and the enforcement of lessons, the work loses the character of commentary proper, and partakes more of the character of homily or discourse.III.

However widely the principles which guided the various Jewish schools of exegesis, or the individual commentatom, differ from those of the modern school, the latter will find a certain suggestiveness in the former&#x27;s interpretation which well merits attention.1. Philo Judaeus:Philo Judaeus: A Hellenistic Jew of Alexandria, Egypt. Born about 20 BC; died after 40 AD. By his allegorical method of exegesis (a method he learned from the Stoics), Philo exercised a far-reaching influence not only on Jewish thought, but even more so on the Christian church. We have but to mention his influence on Origen and other Alexandrian Christian writers. His purpose in employing his allegorical method was, mainly, to reconcile Greek philosophy with the Old Testament.See PHILO, JUDAEUS.Josephus cannot be called a Bible commentator in the proper sense of the term.See JOSEPHUS.2. Targum:Targum (plural Targumim): The Aramaic translation of the Old Testament. Literally, the word designates a translation in general; its use, however, has been restricted to the Aramaic version of the Old Testament, as contrasted with the Hebrew text which was called miqra&#x27;. The Targum includes all the books of the Old Testament except Daniel and Ezra-Nehemiah, which are written in part in Aramaic. Its inception dates back to the time of the Second Temple, and it is considered a first approach to a commentary before the time of Jesus. For the Targum is not a mere translation, but rather a combination of a translation with a commentary, resulting in a paraphrase, or an interpretative translation--having its origin in exegesis. The language of this paraphrase is the vernacular tongue of Syria, which began to reassert itself throughout Palestine as the language of common intercourse and trade, as soon as a familiar knowledge of the Hebrew tongue came to be lost. The Targumim are:TO THE PENTATEUCH(1) Targum Onkelos or Babylonian Targum (the accepted and official);(2) Targum yerushalmi or Palestinian Targum (&quot;Pseudo-Jonathan&quot;; aside from this (complete) Targum there are fragments of the Palestinian Targum termed &quot;Fragment Targrim&quot;).TO THE PROPHETS(1) Targrim Jonathan ben Uzziel (being the official one; originated in Palestine and was then adapted to the vernacular of Babylonia);(2) A Palestinian Targrim, called Targum yerushalmi (Palestinian in origin; edition Lagarde, &quot;Prophetae Chaldaice&quot;).

In these passages the word is not used exactly in its modern sense. The Hebrew term means &quot;an imaginative development of a thought or theme suggested by Scripture, especially a didactic or homiletic exposition, or an edifying religious story&quot; (Driver, Introduction to the Literature of the Old Testament, 5, 497). In the commentaries (Midhrashim) mentioned by the Chronicler as among his sources, the story of Abijah&#x27;s reign was presumably related and elaborated with a view to moral instruction rather than historic accuracy.See CHRONICLES, BOOKS OF; COMMENTARIES, HEBREW.M.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kom&#x27;-ers (emporia):I. Old Testament Times.1. Early Overland Commerce:There were forces in early Hebrew life not favorable to the development of commerce. Intercourse with foreigners was not encouraged by Israel&#x27;s social and religious customs. From the days of the appearance of the Hebrews in Canaan, however, some commercial contact with the peoples around was inevitable. There were ancient trade routes between the East and the West, as well as between Egypt and the Mesopotamian valley. Palestine lay as a bridge between these objective points. There were doubtless traveling merchants from very remote times, interchanging commodities of other lands for those of Palestine Some of the Hebrew words for &quot;trading&quot; and &quot;merchant&quot; indicate this (compare cachar, &quot;to travel,&quot; rakhal, &quot;to go about&quot;). In the nomadic period, the people were necessarily dependent upon overland commerce for at least a part of their food supply, such as grain, and doubtless for articles of clothing, too. Frequent local famines would stimulate such trade. Companies or caravans carrying on this overland commerce are seen in Ge 37:25,28, &quot;Ishmaelites&quot; and &quot;Midianites, merchantmen,&quot; on their way to Egypt, with spices, balm and myrrh. Jacob caused his sons to take certain products to Egypt as a present with money to Joseph in return for grain: balsam, spices, honey, myrrh, nuts, almonds (Ge 43:11 f). The presence of a &quot;Bab mantle&quot; among the spoils of Ai (Jos 7:21) indicates commerce between Canaan and the East.2. Sea Traffic:While there are slight indications of a possible sea trade as early as the days of the Judges (Jud 5:17; compare Ge 49:13), we must wait till the days of the monarchy of David and especially Solomon for the commerce of ships. Land traffic was of course continued and expanded (1Ki 10:15,28,29; 2Ch 1:16). Sea trade at this time made large strides forward. The Philistines were earlier in possession of the coast. Friendship with Hiram king of Tyre gave Solomon additional advantages seaward (1Ki 5; 9:26; 10:19-29; 2Ch 8:17; 9:14), since the Phonicians were pre-eminently the Miditerranean traders among all the people of Palestine Later, commerce declined, but Jehoshaphat attempted to revive it (1Ki 22:48; 2Ch 20:36), but without success. Tyre and Sidon as great commercial centers, however, long impressed the life of Israel (Isa 23; Eze 26-27). Later, in the Maccabean period, Simon acquired Joppa as a Jewish port (1 Macc 14:5), and so extended Mediterranean commerce.3. Land Traffic in the Time of the Kings:During the peaceful reign of Solomon, there came, with internal improvements and foreign friendships, a stimulus to traffic with Egypt and the Far East over the ancient trade routes as well as with Phoenicia on the northwest. He greatly added to his wealth through tariffs levied upon merchantmen (1Ki 10:15). Trade with Syria in the days of Omri and Ahab is indicated by the permission Benhadad gave to Israelites to open streets, or trading quarters, in Damascus, as Syri...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kom&#x27;-un: koinos, in the classics, and primarily in the New Testament, means what is public, general, universal, as contrasted with idios, what is peculiar, individual, not shared with others. Thus, &quot;common faith&quot; (Tit 1:4), &quot;common salvation&quot; (Jude 1:3), refer to that in which the experience of all Christians unites and is identical: &quot;common,&quot; because there is but one faith and one salvation (Eph 4:4-6). From this comes the derived meaning of what is ordinary and, therefore, to be disesteemed, as contrasted with what pertains to a class, and to be prized, because rare. This naturally coincides with Old Testament exclusivism, particularity and separation. Its religion was that of a separated people, with a separated class as its ministers, and with minute directions as to distinctions of meat, drink, times, places, rites, vessels, etc. Whatever was common or ordinary, it avoided. The New Testament, on the other hand, with its universalism of scope, and its spirituality of sphere, rose above all such externals. The salvation which it brought was directed to the redemption of Nature, as well as of man, sanctifying the creature, and pervading all parts of man&#x27;s being and all relations of life. The antithesis is forcibly illustrated in Ac 10:14 f, where Peter says: &quot;I have never eaten anything that is common and unclean,&quot; and the reply is: &quot;What God hath cleansed, make not thou common.&quot;H.

Use of Term:The actual expression &quot;communion with demons&quot; (koinonoi ton daimonion) occurs but once in Scripture (1Co 10:20) where its figurative meaning is evident, but it is implied in the English version of a number of passages by the terms &quot;one who has&quot; or &quot;those who have&quot; &quot;familiar spirits&quot; (Le 19:31; 20:6,27; De 18:11; 1Sa 28:3,7,8,9; 2Ki 21:6; 23:24; 1Ch 10:13; 2Ch 33:6; Isa 8:19; 19:3; 29:4). These passages seem to be somewhat incongruous with Paul&#x27;s statement, but are in reality so intimately related to it as to give and receive light through the connection.II. Teaching of Scripture.To begin with, we may safely say, in general, that there is no ground for asserting that the Bible admits the possibility of conscious and voluntary communion with spirits. This is an essential element of popular demonology in all ages, but it is absent from Scripture. Even in the passages mentioned above which refer to necromancers and wizards, while, as we shall see, the words indicate that such practitioners professed to rely upon spirits in their divinations, the Scriptures carefully refrain from sanctioning these claims, and a number of features in the various passages serve to indicate that the true scriptural view is quite the opposite. As this is not a prevalent opinion, we should do well to examine the passages with some little care.1. The New Testament:(1) We may first deal with the New Testament. In the Gospels the demoniacs are consistently looked upon and treated as unconscious and helpless victims (see DEMON, DEMONOLOGY). The frequent use of this term &quot;demonized&quot; (daimonizomenoi) together with all that is told us of the methods of treating these eases adopted by our Lord and His apostles (see EXORCISM) indicates the belief of the New Testament writers that the control of demons over men is obtained outside of or below the region of conscious volition and that the condition of the sufferers is pathological.(2) The same must be said of the Lydian maiden whose cure by Paul is recorded in Ac 16:16. This is the one instance in the New Testament where divination is connected with spirits. The account emphasizes the excitable neurosis of the patient; and the belief on the part of the apostles and of the writer of Ac that the girl was not the conscious accomplice of her masters, but their unfortunate victim through her mysterious malady, is clear. She was treated, as the other eases recorded in the New Testament, not as a conscious wrongdoer, but as a sick person to be healed.2. The Old Testament:(1) Turning now to the Old Testament, the instance which requires the most careful treatment, because it holds the key to all the rest, is the narrative of Saul&#x27;s visit to the Witch of Endor in 1Sa 28:3-25. The Hebrew word &#x27;obh which is usually translated &quot;one who has a familiar spirit&quot; (see list of passages at beginning of article) occurs in this narrative four times (verses 3, 7 twice, 8). According to the ordinary interpretation it is...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ko-mun&#x27;-yun: The terms &quot;communion&quot; and &quot;fellowship&quot; of the English Bible are varying translations of the words koinonia, and koinoneo, or their cognates. They designate acts of fellowship observed among the early Christians or express the unique sense of unity and fellowship of which these acts were the outward expression. The several passages in which these terms are used fall into two groups: those in which they refer to acts of fellowship, and those in which they refer to fellowship as experienced.I. Ac of Fellowship.The acts of fellowship mentioned in the New Testament are of four kinds.1. The Lord&#x27;s Supper:Our information concerning the nature of the fellowship involved in the observance of this sacrament is confined to the single notice in 1Co 10:16,17, &quot;The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ?&quot; Owing to the presence of the material elements in the sacrament there is a temptation to limit the word for communion to the sense of partaking. This, however, does not entirely satisfy the requirements of the context. The full significance of the term is to be sought in the light of the argument of the whole section (verses 14-22).Paul is making a protest against Christians participating in idolatrous feasts on the ground that such feasts are really celebrated in honor of the demons associated with the idols, and that those who participate in them come into fellowship with demons. As a proof of this point the apostle cites the Lord&#x27;s Supper with which his readers are familiar. By partaking of the cup and the bread the communicants are linked together in unity: &quot;We, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we all partake of the one bread.&quot; Thus the communion of the elements is a real communion of the worshippers one with another and with Christ. Unless the communion be understood in this spiritual sense Paul&#x27;s illustration falls short of the mark.See EUCHARIST.2. Communism:The term for fellowship as used in Ac 2:42 is by some interpreted in this sense: &quot;They continued stedfastly in the apostles&#x27; teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.&quot; The fact that the four terms are used in pairs and that three of them refer to specific acts observed by the company of believers suggests that the term for fellowship also refers to some definite act similar to the others. It is very plausible to refer this to the community of goods described in the verses immediately following (see COMMUNITY OF GOODS). The author might, however, with equal propriety have regarded the interchange of spiritual experiences as an act of worship in the same class with &quot;the breaking of bread and the prayers.&quot;3. Contributions:Christian fellowship found a natural mode of expression in almsgiving. This is enjoined as a duty in Ro 12:13; 1Ti 6:18; Heb 13:16. An example of such giving is the great collection raised among the Gentileconverts for the poor s...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ko-mu&#x27;-ni-ti, (hapanta koina eichon, literally, &quot;They had all things (in) common&quot;): In Ac 2:44, it is said that, in the infant church at Jerusalem, &quot;all that believed were together, and had all things common,&quot; and (Ac 4:34 f) &quot;as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them at the apostles&#x27; feet.&quot; The inference from this, that there was an absolute disposal of all the property of all the members of the church, and that its proceeds were contributed to a common fund, has been disputed upon the ground that the example of Barnabas in selling &quot;a field&quot; for this purpose (Ac 4:37) would not have been mentioned, if this had been the universal rule. The thought conveyed is that all believers in that church held their property as a trust from the Lord, for the benefit of the entire brotherhood, and, as there was need, did as Barnabas.No commandment, of which record has been preserved, prescribed any such course. It came from the spontaneous impulse of the sense of brotherhood in Christ, when the band of disciples was still small, making them in a sense one family, and under the external constraint of extreme want and persecution. So much there was, that they realized, under such conditions they had in common, that they were ready to extend this to all things. It was, in a sense, a continuance of the practice of a common purse in the band of immediate followers of our Lord during his ministry. The penalty inflicted on Ananias and Sapphira was not for any failure to comply fully with this custom, but because this freedom which they possessed (Ac 5:4) they falsely professed to have renounced, thus receiving in the estimation of their brethren a credit that was not their due. This custom did not last long. It was possible only within a limited circle, and under very peculiar circumstances. The New Testament recognizes the right of individual property and makes no effort to remove the differences that exist among believers themselves. The community of goods which it renders possible is spiritual (1Co 3:21 f), and not one of visible and external things. With respect to the latter, it enjoins upon the Christian, as a steward of God, the possession and administration of property for the progress of the kingdom of God, and the highest interests of men. The spirit of Ac 4:34 is always to pervade the association of believers as a true Christian community. Meyer, on the above passage, has suggested that it is not unlikely that the well-known poverty of the church at Jerusalem, and its long dependence upon the alms of other churches, may be connected with this early communistic practice, which, however justifiable and commendable at the time, bore its inevitable fruits in a subsequent season of great scarcity and lack of employment.H.

Heathen Aspirations and Unconscious Prophecies6. Lessons Taught by Comparative ReligionLITERATUREI. The Subject in General.The science of comparative religion is perhaps the latest born of all sciences. Largely in consequence of this fact, our knowledge of what it really proves is still far from definite, and men draw most contradictory conclusions on this point. As in the case of all new sciences in the past, not a few people have endeavored under its shelter to attack Christianity and all revealed religion. These assaults already give signs of failure--as in similar cases previously-- and a new evidence of Christianity is emerging from the conflict. It is only &quot;a little learning&quot; that is proverbially dangerous. The subject with which the science of comparative religion deals is religion in general and all the facts which can be learnt about all religions ancient and modern, whether professed by savages or prevalent among highly civilized communities, whether to be studied in sacred books or learnt orally from the people.1. Universality of Religion:In this way we learn first of all that religion is a universal phenomenon, found among all nations, in all conditions, though differing immensely in its teachings, ceremonies and effects in different places. It is perhaps the most powerful for good or evil of all the instincts (for it is an instinct) which influence mankind.2. Theories of Origin and Growth of Religion:To account for the origin and growth of religion various theories have been propounded:(1) &quot;Humanism,&quot; which is the revival of the ancient view of Euhemeros (circa 400 BC) that all religion arose from fear of ghosts, and all the gods were but men who had died;(2) &quot;Animism,&quot; which traces religion to early man&#x27;s fancy that every object in Nature had a personality like his own;(3) the Astral Theory, which supposes that religion originated from worship of the heavenly bodies.It is clear that there are facts to support each of these hypotheses, yet no one of them satisfies all the conditions of the case. To (1) it has been replied that most tribes from the earliest times clearly distinguished between those deities who had been men, and the gods proper, who had never been men and had never died. Regarding (2), it should be observed that it admits that man&#x27;s consciousness of his own personality and his fancy that it exists in other ...</p>

But, while racham applied to the lower viscera as well as the higher, splagchnon denoted chiefly the higher viscera, the heart, lungs, liver.The Revised Version (British and American) gives &quot;compassion&quot; for &quot;mercy&quot; (Isa 9:17; 14:1; 27:11; 49:13; Jer 13:14; 30:18; Da 1:9 the King James Version &quot;tender love with&quot;; for &quot;bowels of compassion,&quot; 1Jo 3:17); for &quot;mercy&quot; (Heb 10:28); &quot;full of compassion&quot; for &quot;merciful&quot; (the American Standard Revised Version &quot;merciful&quot; in all cases) (Ex, 34:6; Ne 9:17; Ps 103:8; Joe 2:13; Jon 4:2); &quot;compassions for mercies&quot; (Isa 63:15; Php 2:1), for &quot;repentings&quot; (Ho 11:8).Compassion, literally a feeling with and for others, is a fundamental and distinctive quality of the Biblical conception of God, and to its prominence the world owes more than words can express.(1) It lay at the foundation of Israel&#x27;s faith in Yahweh. For it was out of His compassion that He, by a marvelous act of power, delivered them from Egyptian bondage and called them to be His own people. Nothing, therefore, is more prominent in the Old Testament than the ascription of compassion, pity, mercy, etc., to God; the people may be said to have gloried in it. It is summed up in such sayings as that of the great declaration in Ex 34:6: &quot;Yahweh-- a God full of compassion (the American Standard Revised Version merciful) and gracious&quot; (compare Ps 78:38; 86:15; 111:4; 112:4; 145:8; La 3:22, &quot;His compassions fail not&quot;). And, because this was the character of their God, the prophets declared that compassion was an essential requirement on the part of members of the community (Ho 6:6; Mic 6:8; compare Pr 19:17).(2) In Jesus Christ, in whom God was &quot;manifest in the flesh,&quot; compassion was an outstanding feature (Mt 9:36; 14:14, etc.) and He taught that it ought to be extended, not to friends and neighbors only, but to all without exception, even to enemies (Mt 5:43-48; Lu 10:30-37).The God of the New Testament, the Father of men, is most clearly revealed as &quot;a God full of compassion.&quot; It extends to the wh...</p>

It may be strong moral urgency, though &quot;constrain&quot; better expresses this.1. In the Old Testament:There are several words indicative of such strong pressure:(1) &#x27;anac &quot;to press&quot;: &quot;none could compel&quot; to drink (Es 1:8);(2) nadhach, &quot;to drive,&quot; &quot;force&quot;: &quot;compelled Judah thereto&quot; (the King James Version, the Revised Version, margin); &quot;led Judah astray&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) (2Ch 21:11). The same word rendered &quot;force,&quot; as the adulteress by flattering words her victim (Pr 7:21);(3) &#x27;adhadh, &quot;to serve&quot;: not to compel him to serve as a bond servant (Le 25:39 the King James Version, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;make him serve&quot;);(4) parats, &quot;to break forth upon,&quot; &quot;urge&quot;: &quot;his servants compelled him&quot; (1Sa 28:23 the King James Version, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;constrained&quot;).2. In the New Testament:In the New Testament two words are found:(1) aggareuo: The word is of Persian origin and means to employ a courier. The Aggaroi were public couriers stationed by appointment of the kings of Persia, at fixed localities, with horses ready for use, to transmit speedily from one to another the royal messages. These couriers had authority to press into their service, in case of need, horses, vessels, and even men, they might meet (Josephus, Ant, XIII ii, 3); &quot;compel thee to go a mile&quot; (Mt 5:41 the King James Version; the Revised Version, margin &quot;impress&quot;); &quot;compelled Simon to bear his cross&quot; (Mt 27:32; Mr 15:21 the King James Version; the Revised Version, margin &quot;impressed&quot;).(2) anagkazo, &quot;to constrain,&quot; whether by force, threats, entreaties, persuasion, etc.: &quot;compel them to come in&quot; (Lu 14:23 the King James Version; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;constrain&quot;). This has been a favorite text of religious persecutors. As Robertson says in his history of Charles V, &quot;As they could not persuade, they tried to compel men to believe.&quot; But it simply means that utmost zeal and moral urgency should be used by Christians to induce sinners to enter the Kingdom of God.

Modern science, in unveiling the secrets of Nature, is opening the way for a better understanding of God&#x27;s creative purpose and plan.katalambano, &quot;to lay hold of,&quot; hence, mentally to apprehend: used of the spiritual capacity of the Christian &quot;to comprehend (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;apprehend&quot;) with all saints&quot; (Eph 3:18) the measureless love of God; and of the inability of the unrenewed heart to know or perceive the revelation of God made in Christ: &quot;the darkness comprehended it not&quot; (Joh 1:5 the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;apprehended&quot;; the Revised Version, margin &quot;overcame&quot;; compare Joh 12:35).(2) kul, &quot;to measure&quot; or &quot;contain,&quot; as grain in a bushel.

Concordances to Latin Vulgate5. Concordances to the Hebrew Old Testament6. Concordances to the Septuagint7. Concordances to the Greek New Testament8. Concordances to the English BibleLITERATURE1. Nature of Work:The object of a concordance of Scripture is to guide the reader to any passage he is in search of by means of an alphabetical arrangement of the words found in Scripture, and the bringing together under each word of all the passages in which that word occurs. Thus, in the verse: &quot;Cast thy burden upon Yahweh&quot; (Ps 55:22), the reader will look in the concordance under the words &quot;cast&quot; or &quot;burden,&quot; and there will find a reference to the text. The merit of a concordance is obviously exhaustiveness and clearness of arrangement. There are abridged concordances of the Bible which give only the most important words and passages. These are seldom satisfactory, and a fuller work has in the end frequently to be resorted to.2. Classes of Concordances:The ordinary reader is naturally most familiar with concordances of the English Bible, but it will be seen that, for scholarly purposes, concordances are just as necessary for the Scriptures in their original tongues, and for versions of the Scriptures other than English There are required concordances of the Old Testament in Hebrew, of the New Testament in Greek, of the Septuagint version (Greek) of the Old Testament, of the Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 A. D.) version (Latin) of the New Testament, as well as of the translations of the Scriptures into German, French and other living languages. There are now, further, required concordances of the RVV of the English Old Testament and New Testament, as well as of the King James Version. There are needed, besides, good concordances to the Apocrypha, alike in its the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) forms. Textual criticism leads to modifications of the earlier concordances of the Hebrew and Greek texts. It is customary in concordances of the English version to facilitate reference by giving not only single words, but also phrases under which several passages are grouped, and to make the work more useful by furnishing lists of Scripture proper names, with their meanings, and, in the larger works, references to the Hebrew or Greek words for which the English words stand.3. Their Indispensableness:The indispensableness of a good concordance for the proper study of the Bible is so apparent that it is not surprising that, since the idea was first conceived, much labor has been expended on the preparation of such works. The wonder rather is that the idea did not occur earlier than it did. No single scholar could ever hope to produce a perfect work of the kind by his own efforts. Modern concordances are based upon the labors of previous generations.4. Concordances to Latin Vulgate:The oldest concordances date from the 13th century, and are ...</p>

The Greek noun, like the verb from which it comes, meaning &quot;to yearn,&quot; &quot;to long,&quot; &quot;to have the heart set upon a thing,&quot; is determined in its moral quality by the source whence it springs or the object toward which it is directed. Thus, our Lord uses it to express the intensest desire of His soul (Lu 22:15). As a rule, when the object is not expressed, it refers to longing for that which God has forbidden, namely, lust. It is not limited to sexual desire, but includes all going forth of heart and will toward what God would not have us to have or be, as its use in the Septuagint of the Ten Commandments clearly shows, for &quot;Thou shalt not covet&quot; (Ex 20:17).H.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kon-dem&#x27;, kon-dem-na&#x27;-shun:1. In the Old Testament:(1) The causative stem of rasha` &quot;to declare (or make) wrong,&quot; &quot;to condemn,&quot; whether in civil, ethical or religious relations. Taken in this sense the word needs no comment (Ex 22:9; De 25:1; Job 40:8); &quot;Who then can condemn?&quot; (Job 34:29, the King James Version &quot;make trouble&quot;).(2) `anash, &quot;to fine.&quot; &quot;Condemned the land&quot; (2Ch 36:3 the King James Version; the King James Version margin &quot;mulcted&quot;; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;amerced&quot;; the American Standard Revised Version &quot;fined&quot;); &quot;wine of the condemned&quot; (Am 2:8; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;fined&quot; (unjustly)).(3) The active participle of shaphaT, &quot;to judge.&quot; &quot;From those that condemn his soul&quot; (Ps 109:31 the King James Version; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;that judge his soul&quot;).2. In the New Testament:The New Testament usage is much more complicated, both because of the greater number of Greek words rendered &quot;condemn&quot; and &quot;condemnation,&quot; and because the King James Version translates the same word in several different ways, apparently with no rule whatever.(1) The most important word is krino, &quot;to judge.&quot; From it are a number of derivative verbs and nouns. the Revised Version (British and American) has rigidly excluded the harsh words &quot;damn&quot; and &quot;damnation,&quot; substituting &quot;judge,&quot; &quot;condemn,&quot; &quot;judgment,&quot; &quot;condemnation.&quot; This is proper, since the word damn (Latin, damnare, &quot;to inflict loss&quot; upon a person, &quot;to condemn&quot;), and its derivatives has, in process of time, suffered degradation, so that in modern English it usually refers to eternal punishment. This special application of the word for some centuries ran side by side with the original meaning, but even as late as Wycliffe&#x27;s version the word &quot;damn&quot; is usually employed in the sense of condemn, as in Job 9:20, &quot;My mouth shall dampne me.&quot; It is even applied to the condemnation of Jesus by the chief priests and scribes (Mr 10:33). This degeneration of the word is perhaps due, as Bishop Sanderson says, &quot;not so much to good acts as to bad manners.&quot; Krino is rendered uniformly &quot;judge&quot; by the Revised Version (British and American), even where the context. compels the thought of condemnation (Joh 3:17,18; 12:47; Ac 7:7; &quot;might be damned,&quot; 2Th 2:12 the King James Version; Ro 14:22; Jas 5:9).(2) The more specific sense of condemn, however, is found in katakrino, &quot;to judge one down&quot; (Mt 12:41,42; Mr 14:64): &quot;is damned if he eat&quot; (Ro 14:23; 1Co 11:32 the King James Version; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;condemned&quot;). See also Mr 16:16; 2Pe 2:6.(3) For &quot;condemnation&quot; there is the noun krima, or krima (for accent see Thayer&#x27;s Lexicon), in a forensic sense, &quot;the sentence of the judge&quot; (Lu 23:40; Mt 23:14, omitted in the Revised Version (British and American); &quot;condemnation of the devil&quot; 1Ti 3:6; 5:12; Jude 1:4).(4) Much stronger is katakrima, &quot;condemnation&quot; (Ro 5:16,18; 8:1) with reference to the Divine judgment against sin.(5) krisis, &quot;the process of judg...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ko&#x27;-ni (shaphan (Le 11:5; De 14:7; Ps 104:18; Pr 30:26)): The word &quot;coney&quot; (formerly pronounced cooney) means &quot;rabbit&quot; (from Latin cuniculus). Shaphan is rendered in all four passages in the Septuagint choirogrullios, or &quot;hedge-hog,&quot; but is now universally considered to refer to the Syrian hyrax, Procavia (or Hyrax) Syriaca, which in southern Palestine and Sinai is called in Arabic wabar, in northern Palestine and Syria Tabsun, and in southern Arabia shufun, which is etymologically closely akin to shaphan. The word &quot;hyrax&quot; (hurax) itself means &quot;mouse&quot; or &quot;shrew-mouse&quot; (compare Latin sorex), so that it seems to have been hard to find a name peculiar to this animal. In Le 11:5 the Revised Version, margin, we find &quot;rock badger,&quot; which is a translation of klip das, the rather inappropriate name given by the Boers to the Cape hyrax. The Syrian hyrax lives in Syria, Palestine and Arabia. A number of other species, including several that are arboreal, live in Africa. They are not found in other parts of the world. In size, teeth and habits the Syrian hyrax somewhat resembles the rabbit, though it is different in color, being reddish brown, and lacks the long hind legs of the rabbit. The similarity in dentition is confined to the large size of the front teeth and the presence of a large space between them and the back teeth. But whereas hares have a pair of front teeth on each jaw, the hyrax has one pair above and two below. Theseteeth differ also in structure from those of the hare and rabbit, not having the persistent pulp which enables the rabbit&#x27;s front teeth to grow continually as they are worn away. They do not hide among herbage like hares, nor burrow like rabbits, but live in holes or clefts of the rock, frequently in the faces of steep cliffs. Neither the hyrax nor the hare is a ruminant, as seems to be implied in Le 11:5 and De 14:7, but their manner of chewing their food may readily have led them to be thought to chew the cud. The hyrax has four toes in front and three behind (the same number as in the tapir and in some fossil members of the horse family), all furnished with nails that are almost like hoofs, except the inner hind toes, which have claws. The hyraxes constitute a family of ungulates and, in spite of their small size, have points of resemblance to elephants or rhinoceroses, but are not closely allied to these or to any other known animals.The camel, the coney and the hare are in the list of unclean animals because they &quot;chew the cud but divide not the hoof,&quot; but all three of these are eaten by the Arabs.The illustration is from a photograph of a group of conies in the Syrian Protestant College at Beirut, prepared by Mr. Douglas Carruthers, who collected these specimens in a cliff in the neighborhood of Tyre. Specimens from the Dead Sea are redder than those from Syria.Alfred Ely Day</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kon-fesh&#x27;-un (yadhah; homologeo, and their derivatives): The radical meaning is &quot;acknowledgment,&quot; &quot;avowal,&quot; with the implication of a change of conviction or of course of conduct on the part of the subject. In English &quot;profession&quot; (the King James Version 1Ti 6:12; Heb 3:1; 4:14), besides absence of the thought just suggested, emphasizes the publicity of the act. Confession, like its Greek equivalent, connotes, as its etymology shows (Latin, con; Greek, homou), that the act places one in harmony with others. It is the uniting in a statement that has previously been made by someone else. Of the two Greek words from the same root in the New Testament, the compound with the Greek preposition ek found, among other places, in Mt 3:6; Ac 19:18; Ro 14:11; Php 2:11, implies that it has come from an inner impulse, i.e. it is the expression of a conviction of the heart. It is referred anthropopathically to God in Job 40:14, where Yahweh says to the patriarch sarcastically: &quot;Then will I also confess of (unto) thee&quot;; and in Re 3:5, where it means &quot;to recognize&quot; or &quot;acknowledge.&quot;When man is said to confess or make confession, the contents of the confession are variously distinguished. All, however, may be grouped under two heads, confession of faith and confession of sin. Confessions of faith are public acknowledgments of fidelity to God, and to the truth through which God is revealed, as 1Ki 8:33. They are declarations of unqualified confidence in Christ, and of surrender to His service; Mt 10:32: &quot;Every one .... who shall confess me before men.&quot; In Php 2:11, however, confession includes, alongside of willing, also unwilling, acknowledgment of the sovereignty of Jesus. The word confession stands also for everything contained in the Christian religion--&quot;the faith&quot; used in the objective and widest sense, in Heb 3:1; 4:14. In both these passages, the allusion is to the New Testament. The &quot;High Priest of our confession&quot; (Heb 3:1) is the High Priest, of whom we learn and with whom we deal in that new revelation, which in that epistle is contrasted with the old.Confessions of sins are also of various classes:(1) To God alone. Wherever there is true repentance for sin, the penitent freely confesses his guilt to Him, against whom he has sinned. This is described in Ps 32:3-6; compare 1Jo 1:9; Pr 28:13. Such confession may be made either silently, or, as in Da 9:19, orally; it may be general, as in Ps 51, or particular, as when some special sin is recognized; it may even extend to what has not been discovered, but which is believed to exist because of recognized inner depravity (Ps 19:12), and thus include the state as well as the acts of sin (Ro 7:18).(2) To one&#x27;s neighbor, when he has been wronged (Lu 17:4): &quot;If he sin against thee seven times in the day, and seven times turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.&quot; It is to this form of c. that James refers (5:16): &quot;Confess .... your sins one to another&quot;; compare Mt 5:23 f.(3) To a spiritual advise...</p>

In the New Testament, this external, objective sense is expressed by bebaioo, as in Mr 16:20; Ro 15:8. The strengthening of mind, purpose, conviction, i.e. the inner or subjective sense (Ac 14:22; 15:32,41) corresponds to episterizo. Used also of ratifying or making valid (kuroo) a covenant (Ga 3:15). The noun is used in the second sense (Heb 6:16; Php 1:7). Confirmation, the rite, in some denominations, of admission to the full communion of the church, which the Roman church has elevated to the place of a sacrament, has only ecclesiastical, but no Scriptural, authority. It is grounded, however, in the Scriptural precedent of the laying on of hands after baptism.See HANDS, IMPOSITION, LAYING ON OF.H. E. Jacobs</p>

Terms Employed:These two words rendered by &quot;congregation&quot; or &quot;assembly&quot; are used apparently without any difference of sense. They appear to include an assembly of the whole people or any section that might be present on a given occasion. Indeed, sometimes the idea appears to correspond closely to that conveyed by &quot;horde,&quot; or even by &quot;crowd.&quot; `Edhah is once used of bees (Jud 14:8). It has been sought to distinguish the two words by means of Le 4:13, &quot;if the whole `edhah of Israel err, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the qahal.&quot; The qahal would then be the smaller body representing the whole `edhah, but the general usage is not favorable to this view (compare e.g. Ex 12:19, &quot;cutting off from the `edhah of Israel,&quot; with Nu 19:20, &quot;cutting off from the qahal&quot;). The idea denoted by these words is said by Wellhausen to be &quot;foreign to Hebrew antiquity,&quot; though it &quot;runs through the Priestly Code from beginning to end&quot; (Prolegomena 78). Yet it is Deuteronomy that presents us with laws excluding certain classes from the qahal, and the word is also found in Ge 49:6; Nu 22:4 (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;multitude&quot;); De 5:22; 9:10; 31:30; Jos 8:35; 1Sa 17:47; 1Ki 8:14; Mic 2:5, and other early passages, while `edhah occurs in 1Ki 12:20 (see further, Eerdmans, Das Buch Exodus, 80 f). On the other hand taste and euphony appear to be responsible for the choice of one or other of the words in many cases. Thus the Chronicler uses qahal frequently, but `edhah only once (2Ch 5:6 = 1Ki 8:5).2. Legal Provisions:Moses provided for the summoning of the congregation by trumpets (Nu 10:2-8). For the sin offering to be brought if the whole congregation erred, see Le 4:13-21.De 23:1-8 (in Heb 2-9) excludes bastards, Ammonites and Moabites from the assembly, even to the tenth generation, while Edomites and Egyptians were admitted in the third. Those who suffer from certain physical defects are also excluded.3. Other Terms:One other word must be noted, mo`edh. It occurs often in the phrase &#x27;ohel mo`edh (&quot;tent of meeting&quot;; see TABERNACLE). But in Nu 16:2 we find it used of certain princes who were &quot;men of renown called to the assembly.&quot;For atsereth, rendered by the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;solemn assembly&quot;, see FEASTS.

The comparison is to the completeness of the victory. Others may place their enemies in subjection; those here mentioned master not only their foes, but themselves. Others destroy their foes and their resources; while those who are &quot;more than conquerors&quot; convert foes into means of still farther promoting the interests for which they struggle (Ro 3:3- 5).

ANTECEDENT CONSCIENCEIII. INTUITIONAL AND ASSOCIATIONAL THEORIESIV. THE EDUCATION OF CONSCIENCEV. HISTORY AND LITERATURE1. Earlier Views2. Reformation and AfterI. Sequent Conscience.The aspect of conscience earliest noticed in literature and most frequently referred to at all times is what is called the Sequent Conscience--that is to say, it follows action.1. Judicial:This is judicial. No sooner is a decision formed than there ensues a judgment favorable or adverse, a sentence of guilty or not guilty. Conscience has often been compared to a court of law, in which there are culprit, judge, witnesses and jury; but these are all in the subject&#x27;s own breast, and are in fact himself.2. Punitive:It is punitive. In the individual&#x27;s own breast are not only the figures of justice already mentioned, but the executioner as well; for, on the back of a sentence of condemnation or acquittal, there immediately follows the pain of a wounded or the satisfaction of an approving conscience; and of all human miseries or blisses this is the most poignant. Especially has the remorse of an evil conscience impressed the human imagination, in such instances as Cain and Judas, Saul and Herod; and the poets, those knowers of human nature, have found their most moving themes in the delineation of this aspect of human experience. The ancient poets represented the terrors of conscience under the guise of the Erinyes or Furies, who, with swift, silent, unswerving footstep, tracked the criminal and pulled him down, while Shakespeare, in such dramas as Macbeth and Richard the Third, has burned the same lessons into the imagination of all readers of his works. The satisfaction of a good conscience may stamp itself on the habitual serenity of one face, and the accusations of an evil conscience may impart a hunted and sinister expression to another (compare The Wisdom of Solomon 17:11).3. Predictive:It is predictive. There is no instinct in the soul of man more august than the anticipation of something after death--of a tribunal at which the whole of life will be revised and retribution awarded with perfect justice according to the deeds done in the body. It is this which imparts to death its solemnity; we instinctively know that we are going to our account. And such great natural instincts cannot be false.4. Social:It is social. Not only does a man&#x27;s own conscience pass sentence on his conduct, but the consciences of others pass sentence on it too; and to this may be due a great intensification of the consequent sensations. Thus, a crime may lie hidden in the memory, and the pain of its guilt may be assuaged by the action of time, when suddenly and unexpectedly it is found out and exposed to the knowledge of all; and, only when the force of the public conscience breaks forth on the culprit, driving him from society, does he feel his guilt in all its magnitude.

The silver and gold and brass and iron of the banned city of Jericho are &quot;consecrated&quot; things (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;holy&quot;) unto the Lord (Jos 6:19); of the priests (2Ch 26:18); of sacrifices (2Ch 29:33; 31:6; Ezr 3:5).See HOLINESS.(4) mille&#x27; yadh, literally, &quot;to fill the hand&quot;; and substantive plural millu&#x27;im, a peculiar idiom used frequently and generally for the installation of a priest into his office; and substantive for the installation offerings which were probably put into the priest&#x27;s hands to symbolize his admission into office; hence, the phrase, &quot;and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons&quot; (Ex 29:9; 28:41; 29:29:33,15; 32:29; Le 8:33; 16:32; 21:10; Nu 3:3; Jud 17:5,12; 2Ch 29:31); of Jeroboam&#x27;s non-Levitical priesthood (1Ki 13:33; 2Ch 13:9); of the altar (Eze 43:26) and of those who contributed to build the temple (1Ch 29:5).

He does not take the initiative, but yields to what the principal proposes. The phrase ek sumphonou, &quot;by consent,&quot; means &quot;by mutual agreement&quot; (1Co 7:5), both parties concerned being placed on an equality. &quot;With one consent&quot; (Ze 3:9, Hebrew &quot;with one shoulder&quot;; Lu 14:18) suggests, although it does not necessarily imply, the result of deliberation and consultation; it may have no other force than that of unanimity.H.

Used in the Old Testament for a variety of Hebrew terms, signifying inspecting (Pr 31:16), examining (Le 13:13), giving serious thoughts to (Ps 77:5 ; Isa 1:3), it often means little more than &quot;see&quot; or &quot;behold&quot; (Ps 8:3; 9:13).H.

In the New Testament diakrinein, for the hostile separation of one from another, dispute (Jude 1:9), or epagonizomai (Jude 1:3), descriptive of the strain to which a contestant is put. The noun is almost universally used with an unfavorable meaning, and as worthy of condemnation, for an altercation arising from a quarrelsome disposition. &quot;By pride cometh only contention&quot; (Pr 13:10). The contentions at Corinth (1Co 1:11) called forth the rebukes of Paul. Where used in the King James Version in a good sense (1Th 2:2) the Revised Version (British and American) has &quot;conflict.&quot; In Ac 15:39, the noun has a peculiar force, where English Versions of the Bible translates paroxusmos (whence English &quot;paroxysm&quot;) by &quot;sharp contention.&quot; The Greek word refers rather to the inner excitement and irritation than to its outward expression.H.

Used of the wind as in Mt 14:24; Mr 6:48; Ac 27:4, where it is spoken of as contrary. Refers also to conflicting doctrines, customs or beliefs, as 1Ti 1:10, &quot;and if there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine.&quot; Several other Greek words are translated with almost an identical meaning.

The phrase in the passage cited, literally rendered, would be &quot;to exercise&quot; or &quot;put fellowship into activity.&quot; The koinonia subsisting among believers because of their inner communion with Christ places them and their gifts and possessions at the service of one another (see COMMUNION). They are enjoined. not to forget to communicate (Heb 13:16). To be &quot;communicative&quot; (koinonikoi) is to be a habit of their lives, the Christian principle being that of the holding of all property as a trust, to be distributed as there is need (Ac 2:44 f; 2Co 8:14 f). The first occasion for calling this fellowship into activity, by way of &quot;contributions,&quot; was within the church at Jerusalem and for its needy members (see COMMUNITY OF GOODS). The second occasion was repeatedly from the infant Gentilechurches for the poor within the same church (Ac 11:29; Ro 15:26; 2Co 8:1-4; 9:2); the fellowship thus widening from intra-congregational to general church benevolence. These contributions were gathered weekly (1Co 16:2 f), were proportioned to the means of the givers (Ac 11:29; 1Co 16:2), were not exacted or prescribed, in a legalistic manner, but were called forth as the free-will offerings of grateful hearts (2Co 8:7), springing from th community spirit, and were sent to their destination by accredited representatives of the congregations (1Co 16:3; Ac 11:30).H.

Contrite, &quot;crushed,&quot; is only the superlative of &quot;broken&quot;; &quot;a contrite heart&quot; is &quot;a heart broken to pieces.&quot; In Holy Scripture, the heart is the seat of all feeling, whether joy or sorrow. A contrite heart is one in which the natural pride and self-sufficiency have been completely humbled by the consciousness of guilt. The theological term &quot;contrition&quot; designates more than is found in these passages. It refers to the grief experienced as a consequence of the revelation of sin made by the preaching of the law (Jer 23:29). The Augsburg Confession (Article XII) analyzes repentance into two parts: &quot;Contrition and faith,&quot; the one the fruit of the preaching of the law, the other of the gospel. While contrition has its degrees, and is not equal in all persons, the promise of forgiveness is not dependent upon the degree of contrition, but solely upon the merit of Christ. It is not simply a precondition of faith, but, as hatred of sin, combined with the purpose, by God&#x27;s aid, to overcome it, grows with faith.H. E. Jacobs</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kon-ver-sa&#x27;-shun (anastrophe, homilia): This word is another illustration of the changes which time makes in a living language. The modern sense of the term is mutual talk, colloquy, but in the King James Version it never means that, but always behavior, conduct. This broader meaning, at a time not much later than the date of the King James Version, began to yield to the special, limited one of today, perhaps, as has been suggested, because speech forms so large a part of conduct. The New Testament words for &quot;converse&quot; in the modern sense are homileo (Lu 24:14,15; Ac 20:11) and sunomileo (Ac 10:27).(1) In the Old Testament the word used to indicate conduct is derekh, &quot;way&quot; the course one travels (the King James Version Ps 37:14; margin 50:23). It is the common Hebrew idea of conduct, possibly due, as Hatch thinks, to the fact that in Syria intercourse between village and village was so much on foot, with difficulty on stony tracks over the hills, and this is reflected in the metaphor.(2) In the New Testament the idea of deportment is once rendered by tropos, &quot;Let your conversation be without covetousness&quot; (Heb 13:5 the King James Version; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;be ye free from the love of money&quot;; the Revised Version, margin &quot;let your turn of mind be free&quot;). But the usual Greek word is anastrophe, &quot;a turning up and down,&quot; possibly due to the fact, as Hatch again avers, that life in the bustling streets of Athens and Rome gave rise to the conception of life as quick motion to and fro. &quot;Ye have heard of my conversation&quot; (Ga 1:13 the King James Version; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;manner of life&quot;). So also Eph 4:22; 1Ti 4:1; Heb 13:7; &quot;Let him show out of a good conversation&quot; (Jas 3:13 the King James Version; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;by his good life&quot;); &quot;vexed with the filthy conversation&quot; (2Pe 2:7 the King James Version; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;lascivious life&quot;); &quot;holy conversation&quot; (2Pe 3:11 the King James Version; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;holy living&quot;); &quot;Our conversation is in heaven&quot; (Php 3:20 the King James Version; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;citizenship&quot; (which see)). See also in the Apocrypha (Tobit 4:14; 2 Macc 5:8).The translations in the Revisions put a wholesome emphasis upon conduct, and eliminate the danger of much misunderstanding.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kon-vur&#x27;-shun:I. The Words &quot;Conversion,&quot; &quot;Convert,&quot; in Biblical Usage.1. In the English Bible:The noun &quot;conversion&quot; (epistrophe) occurs in only one passage in the Bible, &quot;They passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles&quot; (Ac 15:3). Derived forms of the verb &quot;convert&quot; are used in the Revised Version (British and American) in Jas 5:19, &quot;convert,&quot; &quot;converteth&quot; (5:20), &quot;converted&quot; (Ps 51:13, margin &quot;return&quot;), &quot;converts&quot; (Isa 1:27, margin &quot;they that return&quot;). In other instances where the King James Version uses forms of the verb &quot;convert&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) employs &quot;turn again&quot; (Isa 6:10; Lu 22:32; Ac 3:19), or &quot;turn&quot; (Isa 60:5; Mt 13:15; 18:3; Mr 4:12; Joh 12:40; Ac 28:27). In Ps 19:7 the reading of the King James Version, &quot;The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul,&quot; has been changed by the revisers into &quot;restoring the soul.&quot; The words commonly used in the English Bible as equivalent with the Hebrew and Greek terms are &quot;turn,&quot; &quot;return,&quot; &quot;turn back,&quot; &quot;turn again&quot; (compare De 4:30; Isa 55:7; Jer 3:12 ff; 25:5; 35:15; Eze 18:21-23; 33:11; Mal 3:7). Thus &quot;convert&quot; is synonymous with &quot;turn,&quot; and &quot;conversion&quot; with &quot;turning.&quot;2. In the Old Testament:The principal Hebrew word is :shubh; other words are panah, haphakh, cabhabh, in Hiphil. They are used(1) in the literal sense, for instance, Ge 14:7; De 17:16; Ps 56:9; Isa 38:8.(2) In the later prophetical writings the verb shubh refers, both in the Qal and Hiphil forms, to the return from the captivity (Isa 1:27; Jer 29:14; 30:3; Eze 16:53; Ze 2:7).(3) In the figurative, ethical or religious sense(a) from God (Nu 14:43; 1Sa 15:11; 1Ki 9:6);(b) more frequently to turn back to God (1Sa 7:3; 1Ki 8:33; Isa 19:22; Joe 2:12; Am 4:6 ff; Ho 6:11; 7:10).3. In the New Testament:The words used in the Septuagint and New Testament are strephein, and its compounds, apostr., anastr., epanastr., hupostr., and especially epistrephein. The latter word occurs 39 times in the New Testament. It is used(1) in the literal sense in Mt 9:22; 10:13; 24:18; Ac 9:40; 15:36, etc.;(2) in the figurative sense, in transitive form. (Lu 1:16 f; Jas 5:19 f). In Ga 4:9 and 2Pe 2:21 it denotes to turn from the right way to the wrong. The opposite meaning, to turn from the wrong way to the right, we find in Lu 22:32; Ac 9:35; 11:21; 14:15; 15:19; 26:18; 2Co 3:16; 1Th 1:9; 1Pe 2:25. In connection with metanoein, &quot;repent,&quot; it is used in Ac 3:19; 26:20. The root word strephein is used in the figurative sense in Mt 18:3; Joh 12:40. Septuagint and Textus Receptus of the New Testament have here epistrephein.II. The Doctrine.While the words &quot;conversion&quot; and &quot;convert&quot; do not occur frequently in our English Bible the teaching contained therein is fundamental in Christian doctrine. From the words themselves it is not possible to derive a clearly defined doctrine of conversion; the materials for the construction of the doctrine must be gathered from the tenor of Biblical teaching.1.

It always implies the presentation of evidence. It is a decision presumed to be based upon a careful and discriminating consideration of all the proofs offered, and has a legal character, the verdict being rendered either in God&#x27;s judgment (Ro 3:19), or before men (Joh 8:46) by an appeal to their consciences in which God&#x27;s law is written (Ro 2:15). Since such conviction is addressed to the heart of the guilty, as well as concerning him externally, the word &quot;reprove&quot; is sometimes substituted. To &quot;convict .... in respect of righteousness, and of judgment&quot; (Joh 16:8), refers to the conviction of the inadequacy and perversity of the ordinary, natural standards of righteousness and judgment, and the approval of those found in Christ, by the agency of the Holy Spirit, as the great interpreter and applier of the work of Christ.H.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kop&#x27;-er (nechosheth): The word is translated &quot;copper&quot; in only one passage (Ezr 8:27 the King James Version). In the American Standard Revised Version of this passage, &quot;brass&quot; has been substituted. Neither describes the actual alloy according to present definitions so well as the word &quot;bronze.&quot; Copper was one of the earliest metals to be known and utilized in alloy, but copper, as a single metal, was probably little used. The remains of spears, balances, arms, vases, mirrors, statues, cooking utensils, implements of all kinds, etc., from Bible times are principally of an alloy of copper hardened with tin known today as bronze (see BRASS). In such passages as De 8:9, where reference is made to the native metal or ores, &quot;copper&quot; should be substituted for &quot;brass&quot; as in the American Standard Revised Version (compare Job 40:18). This is true also of coins as chalkos, in Mt 10:9.Our modern English word &quot;copper&quot; is derived from an old name pertaining to the island of Cyprus. Copper was known to the ancients as Cyprian brass, probably because that island was one of the chief sources for this metal. The Sinai peninsula and the mountains of northern Syria also contributed to the ancient world&#x27;s supply (see Tell el-Amarna Letters). No evidences of copper ore in any quantity are found in Palestine proper.See METAL; MINE.James A. Patch.</p>

CHIEF EDITIONSLITERATUREI. Language and Alphabet.1. Alphabet:The Coptic alphabet consists of the Greek uncial letters, plus seven characters taken from the Egyptian demotic to express sounds not represented in the Greek It can be traced back to the 4th century, as the oldest Coptic manuscripts belong to the end of the 4th or beginning of the 5th century. The language still prevailed in Egypt in the 9th century, but was no longer understood in Middle Egypt in the 12th. Its last speaker died in 1633.2. Dialects:There were at least five written dialects and subdialects of Coptic. Of these the most important from a literary point of view was the(1) Buchairic, the dialect of Lower Egypt, often called Coptic paragraph excellence, and also (wrongly) Memphitic. It is used as the ecclesiastical language in the services of the Coptic church. The other four dialects are somewhat more closely allied to one another than to Buchairic, which shows greater traces of Greek influence. These dialects are,(2) the Sahidic (Sa`idi, or dialect of upper Egypt), also called Thebaic;(3) the Bashmuric--or rather Bushmuric--(for which Fayyumic has been suggested);(4) the Middle Egyptian proper (known from manuscripts found in the monastery of Jeremias near the Theban Serapeum), differing but little from (3); and(5) the Akhmimic (Akhmim = the ancient Chemmis). Akhmimic is more primitive and more closely related to ancient Egyptian than any other. Only a few fragments in it (of Exodus, Ecclesiastes, 2 Maccabees, the Minor Prophets, and Catholic epistles) have yet been found. The last three dialects are often classed together as &quot;Middle Egyptian&quot; and (4) is then called &quot;Lower Sahidic.&quot;II. Versions.In all 5 dialects more or less complete versions of the Bible once existed. They were the earliest made after the early Syriac At latest they began in the 3rd century, though some (e.g. Hyvernat) say as early as the 2nd. It is thought that the Sahidic version was the earliest, then the Middle Egyptian and finally the Buchairic. The latter represents an early and comparatively pure Greek text, free from what are generally termed western additions, while the Sahidic, on the other hand, contains most of the peculiar western readings. It sometimes supports Codex Sinaiticus, sometimes Codex Vaticanus (B), sometimes both, but generally it closely agrees with codex D (Bezae), especially in the Acts. A Coptic (Sahidic) MS, written considerably before 350 AD, and published by the British Museum in April, 1912, contains Deuteronomy, Jonah, and Acts, and is older than any other Biblical manuscript (except a few fragments) yet known to exist. It proves that this Sahidic version was made about 200 AD. It in general supports the &quot;Western&quot; text of codex Bezae (D). Much of the New Testament especially still exists in Sahidic, though not Revelation. In Bubairic we have the Pentateuch, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Isaiah, Je...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kor&#x27;-al (ra&#x27;moth, peninim): The red coral or precious coral, Corallium rubrum, is confined to the Mediterranean and Adriatic seas. It is the calcareous axis of a branching colony of polyps. It does not form reefs, but occurs in small masses from 40 to 100 fathoms below the surface. It differs totally in structure from the white corals which form coral reefs, belonging to the order of Octactinia or Eight-rayed Polyps, while the reef-building corals belong to the Hexactinia or Six-rayed Polyps.Ra&#x27;moth, apparently from r. ra&#x27;am, &quot;to be high&quot; (compare rum, &quot;to be high&quot;), occurs in three passages. In Pr 24:7, EVV have &quot;too high&quot;: &quot;Wisdom is too high for a fool.&quot; In Job 28:12-19, where various precious things are compared with wisdom, English Versions of the Bible has &quot;coral&quot;(King James Version, margin &quot;Ramoth&quot;). It is mentioned here along with ceghor, &quot;gold&quot; (the Revised Version, margin &quot;treasure&quot;); kethem, &quot;gold of Ophir&quot;; shoham, &quot;onyx&quot; (the Revised Version, margin &quot;beryl&quot;); cappir, &quot;sapphire&quot;; zahabh, &quot;gold&quot;; zekhukhith, &quot;crystal&quot; (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;glass&quot;); paz, &quot;gold&quot;; gabhish, &quot;pearls&quot; (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;crystal&quot;); peninim, &quot;rubies&quot; (the Revised Version, margin &quot;red coral&quot; or &quot;pearls&quot;); piTedhah, &quot;topaz.&quot; While the real meaning of some of these terms is doubtful (see STONES, PRECIOUS), they all, including ra&#x27;moth, appear to be precious stones or metals. In Eze 27:16, ra&#x27;moth occurs with nophekh, &quot;emeralds&quot; (the Revised Version, margin &quot;carbuncles&quot;); &#x27;argaman, &quot;purple&quot;; riqmah, &quot;broidered work&quot;; buts, &quot;fine linen&quot;; kadhkodh, &quot;agate&quot;(King James Version, margin &quot;chrysoprase,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;rubies&quot;). Here the context does not require a precious stone or metal, and Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 A. D.) has sericum, i. e. &quot;Chinese material&quot; or &quot;silk.&quot; Notwithstanding, therefore, the traditional rendering, &quot;coral,&quot; the real meaning of ra&#x27;moth must be admitted to be doubtful.Peninim (from the root panan, &quot;to divide up,&quot; &quot;to separate&quot;; compare Arabic fanan, &quot;a branch of a tree&quot;) occurs in Job 28:18; Pr 3:15; 8:11; 20:15; 31:10; La 4:7. In all these passages English Versions of the Bible has &quot;rubies&quot; (Job 28:18, the Revised Version, margin &quot;red coral&quot; or &quot;pearls&quot;; La 4:7, the Revised Version, margin &quot;corals&quot;). Everywhere a precious substance is indicated, but nowhere does the context give any light as to the nature of the substance, except in La 4:7, where we have the statement that the nobles of Jerusalem &quot;were more ruddy in body&quot; than peninim. This and the etymology favor a branching red substance such as precious coral. The occurrence of peninim and ra&#x27;moth together in Job 28:18 is, if we give the precedence to peninim, a further argument against ra&#x27;moth meaning &quot;coral.&quot;Alfred Ely Day</p>

It is the most general term for a sacrifice of any kind. In the course of time it became associated with an objectionable practice. Anything dedicated to the temple by pronouncing the votive word &quot;Corban&quot; forthwith belonged to the temple, but only ideally; actually it might remain in the possession of him who made the vow. So a son might be justified in not supporting his old parents simply because he designated his property or a part of it as a gift to the temple, that is, as &quot;Corban&quot; There was no necessity of fulfilling his vow, yet he was actually prohibited from ever using his property for the support of his parents. This shows clearly why Christ singled out this queer regulation in order to demonstrate the sophistry of tradition and to bring out the fact of its possible and actual hostility to the Scripture and its spirit.William Baur</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kord (chebhet, yether, methar, `abhoth; schoinion):(1) The Arabic chab&#x27;l corresponds to the Hebrew chebhel and is still the common name for cord or rope throughout the East. Such ropes or cords are made of goat&#x27;s or camel&#x27;s hair, first spun into threads and then twisted or plaited into the larger and stronger form. Chebhel is translated rather inconsistently in the Revised Version (British and American) by &quot;cord&quot; (Jos 2:15; Job 36:8, etc.); by &quot;line&quot; (2Sa 8:2; Mic 2:5; Ps 16:6; 78:55; Am 7:17; Zec 2:1); by &quot;ropes&quot; (1Ki 20:31), and by &quot;tacklings&quot; (Isa 33:23).(2) Yether corresponds to the Arabic wittar, which means catgut. With a kindred inconsistency it is translated the Revised Version (British and American) by &quot;withes&quot; (Jud 16:7 the Revised Version, margin &quot;bowstring&quot;); by &quot;cord&quot; (Job 30:11), where some think it may mean &quot;bowstring,&quot; or possibly &quot;rein&quot; of a bridle, and by &quot;bowstring&quot; (Ps 11:2), doubtless the true meaning.(3) Methar is considered the equivalent of Arabic atnab, which means tent ropes, being constantly so used by the Bedouin. They make the thing so called of goat&#x27;s or camel&#x27;s hair. It is used of the &quot;cords&quot; of the tabernacle (Jer 10:20), of the &quot;cords&quot; of the &quot;hangings&quot; and &quot;pillars&quot; of the courts of the tabernacle in Exodus and Numbers, and figuratively by Isa 54:2, &quot;Lengthen thy cords,&quot; etc.(4) `Abhoth is thought to have its equivalent in the Arabic rubuts, which means a band, or fastening. See BAND. It is translated by &quot;cords&quot; in Ps 118:27; 129:4; by &quot;bands&quot; in Eze 3:25; Job 39:10; Ho 11:4; by &quot;ropes&quot; in Jud 15:13,14, and by &quot;cart rope&quot; in Isa 5:18. See CART. See also Nu 15:38 and AMULET. It Seems to have the meaning of something twisted or interlaced.(5) In the New Testament &quot;cord&quot; is found in Joh 2:15, translating schoinion, but in Ac 27:32 the same Greek word is rendered &quot;ropes.&quot;Figurative:(1) of affliction (Job 36:8);(2) of God&#x27;s laws (Ps 2:3);(3) of the artifices of the wicked (Ps 129:4; 140:5);(4) of sinful habits (Pr 5:22);(5) of true friendship or companionship (Ec 4:12);(6) possibly of the spinal cord (Ec 12:6);(7) of falsehood (Isa 5:18);(8) of the spirit of enterprise and devotion (Isa 54:2);(9) of God&#x27;s gentleness.George B.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kor&#x27;-inth (Korinthos, &quot;ornament&quot;): A celebrated city of the Peloponnesus, capital of Corinthia, which lay North of Argolis, and with the isthmus joined the peninsula to the mainland. Corinth had three good harbors (Lechaeum, on the Corinthian, and Cenchrea and Schoenus on the Saronic Gulf), and thus commanded the traffic of both the eastern and the western seas. The larger ships could not be hauled across the isthmus (Ac 27:6,37); smaller vessels were taken over by means of a ship tramway with wooden rails. The Phoenicians, who settled here very early, left many traces of their civilization in the industrial arts, such as dyeing and weaving, as well as in their religion and mythology. The Corinthian cult of Aphrodite, of Melikertes (Melkart) and of Athene Phoenike are of Phoenician origin. Poseidon, too, and other sea deities were held in high esteem in the commercial city. Various arts were cultivated and the Corinthians, even in the earliest times, were famous for their cleverness, inventiveness and artistic sense, and they prided themselves on surpassing the other Greeks in the embellishment of their city and in the adornment of their temples. There were many celebrated painters in Corinth, and the city became famous for the Corinthian order of architecture: an order, which, by the way, though held in high esteem by the Romans, was very little used by the Greeks themselves. It was here, too, that the dithyramb (hymn to Dionysus) was first arranged artistically to be sung by a chorus; and the Isthmian games, held every two years, were celebrated just outside the city on the isthmus near the Saronic Gulf. But the commercial and materialistic spirit prevailed later. Not a single Corinthian distinguished himself in literature. Statesmen, however, there were in abundance: Periander, Phidon, Timoleon.Harbors are few on the Corinthian Gulf. Hence, no other city could wrest the commerce of these waters from Corinth. According to Thucydides, the first ships of war were built here in 664 BC. In those early days Corinth held a leading position among the Greek cities; but in consequence of her great material prosperity she would not risk all as Athens did, and win eternal supremacy over men: she had too much to 1ose to jeopardize her material interests for principle, and she soon sank into the second class. But when Athens, Thebes, Sparta and Argos fell away, Corinth came to the front again as the wealthiest and most important city in Greece; and when it was destroyed by Mummius in 146 BC, the treasures of art carried to Rome were as great as those of Athens. Delos became the commercial center for a time; but when Julius Caesar restored Corinth a century later (46 BC), it grew so rapidly that the Roman colony soon became again one of the most prominent centers in Greece. When Paul visited Corinth, he found it the metropolis of the Peloponnesus. Jews flocked to this center of trade (Ac 18:1-18; Ro 16:21 ff; 1Co 9:20), the natural site for a great mart, and...</p>

Authenticity of the Two Epistles.1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians and Romans, all belong to the period of Paul&#x27;s third missionary journey. They are the most remarkable of his writings, and are usually distinguished as the four great or principal epistles; a distinction which not only is a tribute to their high originality and intrinsic worth, but also indicates the extremely favorable opinion which critics of almost all schools have held regarding their authenticity. Throughout the centuries the tradition has remained practically unbroken, that they contain the very pectus Paulinum, the mind and heart of the great apostle of the Gentiles, and preserve to the church an impregnable defense of historical Christianity. What has to be said of their genuineness applies almost equally to both.1. External Evidence:The two epistles have a conspicuous place in the most ancient lists of Pauline writings. In the Muratorian Fragment (circa 170) they stand at the head of the nine epistles addressed to churches, and are declared to have been written to forbid heretical schism (primum omnium Corinthiis schisma haeresis intredicens); and in Marcion&#x27;s Apostolicon (circa 140) they stand second to Gal. They are also clearly attested in the most important writings of the subapostolic age, e.g. by Clement of Rome (circa 95), generally regarded as the friend of the apostle mentioned in Php 4:3; Ignatius (Ad Ephes., chapter xviii, second decade of 2nd century); Polycarp (chapters ii, vi, xi, first half of 2nd century), a disciple of John; and Justin Martyr (born at close of let century); while the Gnostic Ophites (2nd century) were clearly familiar with both epistles (compare Westcott, Canon, passim, and Index II; also Charteris, Canonicity, 222-224, where most of the original passages are brought together). The witness of Clement is of the highest importance. Ere the close of the let century he himself wrote a letter to the Corinthians, in which (chapter xlvii, Lightfoot&#x27;s edition, 144) he made a direct appeal to the authority of 1 Cor: &quot;Take up the letter of Paul the blessed apostle; what did he write to you first in the beginning of the gospel? Verily he gave you spiritual direction regarding himself, Cephas, and Apollos, for even then you were dividing yourselves into parties.&quot; It would be impossible to desire more explicit external testimony.2.

Text, Authenticity and Date.1. Internal Evidence:Compare what has already been said in the preceding article. In the two important 5th-century uncials, Codex Alexandrinus (A) and Codex Ephraemi (C), portions of the text are lacking. As to the genuineness internal evidence very vividly attests it. The distinctive elements of Pauline theology and eschatology, expressed in familiar Pauline terms, are manifest throughout. Yet the epistle is not doctrinal or didactic, but an intensely personal document. Its absorbing interest is in events which were profoundly agitating Paul and the Corinthians at the time, straining their relations to the point of rupture, and demanding strong action on Paul&#x27;s part. Our imperfect knowledge of the circumstances necessarily hinders a complete comprehension, but the references to these events and to others in the personal history of the apostle are so natural, and so manifestly made in good faith, that no doubt rises in the reader&#x27;s mind but that he is in the sphere of reality, and that the voice he hears is the voice of the man whose heart and nerves were being torn by the experiences through which he was passing. However scholars may differ as to the continuity and integrity of the text, there is no serious divergence among them in the opinion that all parts of the epistle are genuine writings of the apostle.2. External Evidence:Externally, the testimony of the sub-apostolic age, though not so frequent or precise as in the case of 1 Corinthians, is still sufficiently clear to establish the existence and use of the epistle in the 2nd century Clement of Rome is silent when he might rather have been expected to use the epistle (compare Kennedy, Second and Third Corinthians, 142 ff); but it is quoted by Polycarp (Ad Phil., ii.4 and vi.1), and in the Epistle to Diognetus 5 12, while it is amply attested to by Irenaeus, Athenagoras, Theophilus, Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria.3. Date:It was written from Macedonia (probably from Philippi) either in the autumn of the same year as that in which 1 Corinthians was written, 54 or 55 AD, or in the autumn of the succeeding year.II. Resume of Events.Great difficulty exists as to the circumstances in which the epistle was written, and as to the whole situation between 1 and 2 Corinthians. In 1 Corinthians Paul had intimated his intention of visiting the Corinthians and wintering with them, coming to them through Macedonia (1Co 16:5-7; compare also Ac 19:21). In 2Co 1:15,16 he refers to a somewhat different plan, Corinth--Macedonia--Corinth--Judaea; and describe...</p>

The adult birds are glossy black with bronze tints, touched with white on the cheeks and sides as a festal dress at mating season, and adorned with filamentary feathers on the head, and bright yellow gape. These birds if taken young and carefully trained can be sent into the water from boats and bring to their masters large quantities of good-sized fish: commonly so used in China. The flesh is dark, tough and quite unfit to eat in the elders on account of their diet of fish. The nest is built mostly of seaweed. The eggs are small for the size of the birds, having a rough, thick, but rather soft shell of a bluish white which soon becomes soiled, as well as the nest and its immediate surroundings, from the habits of the birds. The young are leathery black, then covered with soft down of brownish black above and white beneath and taking on the full black of the grown bird at about three years. If taken in the squab state the young are said to be delicious food, resembling baked hare in flavor. The old birds are mentioned among the abominations for food (Le 11:13-19; De 14:12-18).Gene Stratton-Porter</p>

His Family and Station:The name is Roman and belonged to distinguished families in the imperial city, such as the Scipios and Sulla. Thus he was probably an Italian of Roman blood. Julian the Apostate reckons him as one of the few persons of distinction who became a Christian. He was evidently a man of importance in Caesarea and well known to the Jews (Ac 10:22). He was a centurion in the Italian cohort. To understand this we must note that the Roman army was divided into two broad divisions, the legions and the auxiliary forces.See ARMY, ROMAN.Legions were never permanently quartered in Palestine until the great war which ended in the destruction of Jerusalem, 70 AD. From the year 6 AD, when Palestine was made into province of the second rank, until 66 AD, it was garrisoned by auxiliary troops recruited amongst the Samaritans and Syrian Greeks. The headquarters were naturally at Caesarea, the residence of the procurator. But it would not have been prudent for a garrison in Palestine to be composed wholly of troops locally recruited. Therefore the Roman government mingled with the garrison 600 soldiers, free Italian volunteers. With this cohort Cornelius was connected as centurion.2. His Character:He is described as devout and God-fearing, i.e. at least, one of those men so numerous in that effete age of decadent heathenism who, discontented with polytheism, yearned for a better faith, embraced, therefore, the monotheism of the Jews, read the Scriptures, and practiced more or less of the Jewish rites. He was well reported of by the Jews, and his religion showed itself in prayer at the regular hours, and in alms to the people (of Israel). Even Jewish bigotry was dumb in presence of so noble a man. Moreover, he seems to have made his house a sort of church, for his kinsfolk and friends were in sympathy with him, and among the soldiers who closely attended him were some devout ones (Ac 10:1,27).3. His Admission into the Christian Church:The story of his conversion and admission into the Christian church is told with some minuteness in Ac 10. Nothing further is known of Cornelius, though one tradition asserts that he founded the church in Caesarea, and another legend that he became the bishop of Scamandros.4. Significance of the Incident:The exact importance of the incident depends upon the position of Cornelius before it occurred. Certainly he was not a proselyte of the sanctuary, circumcised, under the law, a member of the Jewish communion. This is abundantly evident from Ac 10:28,34,45; 11:3,18; 15:7,14. But was he not an inferior form of proselyte, later called &quot;proselytes of the gate&quot;? This question has been much debated and is still under discussion. Ramsay (St. Paul the Traveler, 43) says that the expression, &quot;God-fearing,&quot; applied to him, is always used in Ac with reference to this kind of proselytes. Such were bound to observe certain regulations of p...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kor&#x27;-ner ston (pinnah, zawith; akrogoniaios): Part of the public or imposing buildings, to which importance has been attached in all ages and in many nations, both on account of its actual service and its figurative meaning. Ordinarily its use in the Bible is figurative, or symbolical. No doubt the original meaning was some important stone, which was laid at the foundation of a building.(1) With the Canaanites, who preceded Israel in the possession of Palestine, corner-stone laying seems to have been a most sacred and impressive ceremonial. Under this important stone of temples, or other great structures, bodies of children or older persons would be laid, consecrating the building by such human sacrifice (see FORTIFICATION, II, 1). This was one of many hideous rites and practices which Israel was to extirpate. It may throw light on the curse pronounced upon the rebuilding of Jericho (Jos 6:26; see PEFS, January, 1904, July, 1908).See CANAAN.(2) Old Testament references.--The Hebrew word pinnah, &quot;corner,&quot; is found or implied in every occurrence of this idea. Derived from a root signifying &quot;to turn,&quot; it means &quot;turning,&quot; and therefore &quot;edge&quot; or &quot;corner.&quot; Ordinarily it is used with &#x27;ebhen, &quot;stone&quot; (Ps 118:22); or it may occur alone, having acquired for itself through frequent use the whole technical phrase-idea (Zec 10:4 the King James Version).Figurative Uses:While all the passages indicate the stone at the corner, there appear to be two conceptions:(a) the foundation-stone upon which the structure rested (Job 38:6; Isa 28:16; Jer 51:26); or(b) the topmost or cap-stone, which linked the last tier together (Ps 118:22; Zec 4:7); in both cases it is an important or key-stone, and figurative of the Messiah, who is &quot;the First and the Last.&quot;In Job 38:6 it beautifully expresses in figures the stability of the earth, which Yahweh created. In Zec 10:4 the leader or ruler in the Messianic age is represented by the corner-stone. The ancient tradition of the one missing stone, when the temple was in building, is reflected in or has been suggested by Ps 118:22 (Midrash quoted by Pusey under Zec 4:7). It is probable that we should read in Ps 144:12 not &quot;corner-stones,&quot; but &quot;corner-pillars,&quot; or supports (compare Greek Caryatides) from a different Hebrew word, zawith, Brown, Driver, and Briggs, Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, under the word(3) New Testament passages.--Ps 118:22 is quoted and interpreted as fulfilled in Jesus Christ in a number of passages: Mt 21:42; Mr 12:10; Lu 20:17; Ac 4:11 and 1Pe 2:7; it is also the evident basis for Eph 2:20. Isa 28:16 is quoted twice in the New Testament: Ro 9:33, from Septuagint combined with the words of Isa 8:14, and in 1Pe 2:6, which is quoted with some variation from Septuagint. The Old Testament passages were understood by the rabbis to be Messianic, and were properly so applied by the New Testament writers.See also HOUSE.Edward Mack</p>

Therefore we find the now apparently unnecessary addition of the adjective &quot;dead&quot; in 2Ki 19:35 and Isa 37:36. The Greek equivalent is ptoma, literally, &quot;a fallen body,&quot; &quot;a ruin&quot; (from pipto, &quot;to fall&quot;), in Mr 6:29; Re 11:8,9.Corpses were considered as unclean and defiling in the Old Testament, so that priests were not to touch dead bodies except those of near kinsfolk (Le 21:1-3), the high priest and a Nazirite not even such (Le 21:11; Nu 6:6-8). Nu 19 presents to us the ceremonial of purification from such defilement by the sprinkling with the ashes of a red heifer, cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet.It was considered a great calamity and disgrace to have one&#x27;s body left unburied, a &quot;food unto all birds of the heavens, and unto the beasts of the earth&quot; (De 28:26; 2Sa 21:10; Ps 79:2; Isa 34:3; Jer 7:33, etc.). Thence is explained the merit of Rizpah (2Sa 21:10), and of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead, who protected or recovered and buried the mutilated bodies of Saul and his sons (1Sa 31:11-13; 2Sa 2:4-7; compare 1Ch 10:11,12).See BURIAL.Even the corpses of persons executed by hanging were not to remain on the tree &quot;all night,&quot; &quot;for he that is hanged is accursed of God; that thou defile not thy land which Yahweh thy God giveth thee for an inheritance&quot; (De 21:23).H.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ko-rup&#x27;-shun: The Hebrew words mishchath, mashchath, mashchith, and their Greek equivalents, phthora, and diaphthora, with numerous derivatives and cognate verbs, imply primarily physical degeneration and decay (Job 17:14; Ac 2:27, etc.). The term shachath, which the King James Version translates with &quot;corruption&quot; in Jon 2:6, ought to be rendered &quot;pit,&quot;. as in Ps 30:9; 35:7 et passim, while shachath beli in Isa 38:17 means the &quot;pit of nothingness,&quot; i.e. of destruction.Figurative: At an early time we find the above-given words in a non-literal sense denoting moral depravity and corruption (Ge 6:11; Ex 32:7; Ho 9:9; Ga 6:8, etc.), which ends in utter moral ruin and hopelessness, the second death. The question has been raised whether the meaning of these words might be extended so as to include the idea of final destruction and annihilation of the spirit. Upon careful examination, however, this question must be denied both from the standpoint of the Old Testament and of the New Testament. Apart from other considerations we see this from the metaphors used in the Scriptures to illustrate the condition of &quot;corruption,&quot; such as the &quot;unquenchable fire,&quot; the &quot;worm&quot; which &quot;dieth not&quot; (Mr 9:43,18; compare Isa 66:24), and &quot;sleep&quot; (Da 12:2), where a careful distinction is made between the blissful state after death of the righteous and the everlasting disgrace of the godless. The later Jewish theology is also fully agreed on this point. The meaning of the words cannot therefore extend beyond the idea of utter moral degradation and depravity.H. L. E. Luering</p>

Har ha-mashchith is probably only a perversion of har ha-mishchah, &quot;Mount of Anointing,&quot; a later name of the Mount of Olives.W. Ewing</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kos (Kos, &quot;summit&quot;; the King James Version Coos): An island off the coast of Caria, Asia Minor, one of the Sporades, mountainous in the southern half, with ridges extending to a height of 2,500 ft.; identified with the modern Stanchio. It was famous in antiquity for excellent wine, amphorae, wheat, ointments, silk and other clothing (Coae vestes). The capital was also called Cos. It possessed a famous hospital and medical school, and was the birthplace of Hippocrates (the father of medicine), of Ptolemy Philadelphus, and of the celebrated painter Apelles. The large plane tree in the center of the town (over 2,000 years old) is called &quot;the tree of Hippocrates&quot; to this day. The older capital, Astypalaea, was in the western part of the island, the later (since 366 BC) in the eastern part. From almost every point can be seen beautiful landscapes and picturesque views of sea and land and mountain.Cos was one of the six Dorian colonies. It soon became a flourishing place of commerce and industry; later, like Corinth, it was one of the Jewish centers of the Aegean, as well as one of the financial centers of the commercial world in the eastern Mediterranean. Among the benefactors of the people of Cos was Herod the Great. It is mentioned in connection with Paul&#x27;s third missionary journey in Ac 21:1, and in its relations with the Jews in 1 Macc 15:23; Ant, XIV, vii, 2; x, 15; BJ, I, xxi. 11.

Distinguished from sunedrion, the supreme court of the Jews, by being of a less formal character, i.e. less of an institution. For &quot;council&quot; in the latter sense, its most frequent use, see SANHEDRIN. A councilor (Greek bouleutes) was a member of the Sanhedrin. Applied to Joseph of Arimathea (Mr 15:43; Lu 23:50).

A counselor (sumboulos) is a confidential adviser (Ro 11:34); often in the Old Testament (Isa 9:6; Pr 24:6, etc.).

In the New Testament the arithmetical computation is less prominent, except in the sense of &quot;calculate,&quot; psephizo, sumpsephizo, &quot;to reckon with pebbles,&quot; each pebble representing a unit (Lu 14:28; Ac 19:19); of moral estimate, hegeomai and logizomai (Php 3:7,13).

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">koun&#x27;-te-nans:(1) The noun (see also under the word FACE) is the translation of a variety of Hebrew and Greek expressions, panim; prosopon, being the most frequent. Besides these there are found mar&#x27;eh, &quot;appearance,&quot; &quot;shape,&quot; &quot;comeliness,&quot; &quot;visage,&quot; `ayin, &quot;the eye,&quot; to&#x27;ar, &quot;appearance,&quot; &quot;figure,&quot; etc., and Aramaic ziw. To the Oriental the countenance mirrors, even more than to us, the character and feelings of the heart. The countenance (mar&#x27;eh) is&quot;fair&quot; (1Sa 17:42; 2Sa 14:27; Da 1:15); in 1Sa 16:12, literally, &quot;fair of eyes&quot;; &quot;comely&quot; (So 2:14); &quot;beautiful&quot; (~to&#x27;ar, 1Sa 25:3); &quot;cheerful&quot; (panim, Pr 15:13); &quot;angry&quot; (Pr 15:23); &quot;fierce&quot; (Da 8:23); &quot;troubled&quot; (Eze 27:35); &quot;sad&quot; (1Sa 1:18; Ne 2:2,3; Ec 7:3). The countenance is &quot;sharpened&quot; i.e. made keen (Pr 27:17); it &quot;falls,&quot; i.e. looks despondent, disappointed (Ge 4:5,6); is &quot;cast down&quot; (Job 29:24); &quot;changed&quot; (Job 14:20; compare &quot;altered&quot; into glory, Lu 9:29; Da 5:6,9,10; 7:28, Aramaic ziw). To settle one&#x27;s countenance stedfastly upon a person (2Ki 8:11) is synonymous with staring or gazing at a person. Not infrequently we find compound expressions such as &quot;light of countenance,&quot; i.e. favor (Job 29:24; Ps 4:6; 44:3; 89:15; 90:8); &quot;health of countenance&quot; (Ps 41:11; 43:5); &quot;help of countenance&quot; (Ps 42:5); &quot;rebuke of countenance&quot; (Ps 80:16); &quot;pride of countenance&quot; (Hebrew &#x27;aph, literally, &quot;haughty,&quot; &quot;lofty nose,&quot; Ps 10:4).(2) As verb (Hebrew hadhar, &quot;to countenance&quot;) we find the word in the King James Version of Ex 23:3, where the Revisers translate &quot;Neither shalt thou favor (the King James Version &quot;countenance&quot;) a poor man in his cause.&quot; Here the meaning seems to be that no distinction of persons shall be made by the judge. See Le 19:15, where, however, a different word is used. There is therefore no need of the emendation proposed by Knobel and accepted by Kautzsch, who would read gadhol, &quot;great,&quot; for wedhal, &quot;and the poor&quot; of the text. The Septuagint has penes, &quot;poor.&quot;H. L. E. Luering</p>

The low country, shephelah (see SHEPHELAH), consisted of the foothills to the west of the hill country.

It was always an uncovered enclosure, but might have within its area one or more edifices.1. The Tabernacle:The first occurrence of the word is in Ex 27:9, where it is commanded to &quot;make the court of the tabernacle.&quot; The dimensions for this follow in the directions for the length of the linen curtains which were to enclose it. From these we learn that the perimeter of the court was 300 cubits, and that it consisted of two squares, each 75 ft., lying East and West of one another. In the westerly square stood the tabernacle, while in that to the East was the altar of burnt offering. This was the worshipper&#x27;s square, and every Hebrew who passed through the entrance gate had immediate access to the altar (compare W. Robertson Smith, note on Ex 20:26, Smith, The Old Testament in the Jewish Church, 435). The admission to this scene of the national solemnities was by the great east gate described in Ex 27:13-16 (see EAST GATE).2. Solomon&#x27;s Temple:The fundamental conception out of which grew the resolve to build a temple for the worship of Yahweh was that the new structure was to be an enlarged duplicate in stone of the tent of meeting (see TEMPLE). The doubling in size of the holy chambers was accompanied by a doubling of the enclosed area upon which the holy house was to stand. Hitherto a rectangular oblong figure of 150 ft. in length and 75 ft. in breadth had sufficed for the needs of the people in their worship. Now an area of 300 ft. in length and 150 ft. in breadth was enclosed within heavy stone walls, making, as before, two squares, each of 150 ft. This was that &quot;court of the priests&quot; spoken of in 2Ch 4:9, known to its builders as &quot;the inner court&quot; (1Ki 6:36; compare Jer 36:10). Its walls consisted of &quot;three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams&quot; (1Ki 6:36), into which some read the meaning of colonnades. Its two divisions may have been marked by some fence. The innermost division, accessible only to the priests, was the site of the new temple. In the easterly division stood the altar of sacrifice; into this the Hebrew laity had access for worship at the altar. Later incidental allusions imply the existence of &quot;chambers&quot; in the court, and also the accessibility of the laity (compare Jer 35:4; 36:10; Eze 8:16).3. The Great Court:In distinction from this &quot;inner&quot; court a second or &quot;outer&quot; court was built by Solomon, spoken of by the Chronicler as &quot;the great court&quot; (2Ch 4:9). Its doors were overlaid with brass (bronze). Wide difference of opinion obtains as to the relation of this outer court to the inner court just described, and to the rest of the Solomonic buildings-- particularly to &quot;the great court&quot; of &quot;the house of the forest of Lebanon&quot; of 1Ki 7:9,10. Some identify the two, others separate them. Did this court, with its brass-covered gates, extend still farther to the East than the temple &quot;inner&quot; court, with...</p>

Their Organization:At the advice of Jethro, Moses appointed judges (shopheTim, Ex 18). In Egypt it appears that the Hebrews did not have their own judges, which, of course, was a source of many wrongs. Leaving Egypt, Moses took the judicial functions upon himself, but it was impossible that he should be equal to the task of administering justice to two and one-half million people; hence, he proceeded to organize a system of jurisprudence. He appointed judges over tens, fifties, hundreds, thousands--in all 78,600 judges. This system was adequate for the occasion, and these courts respectively corresponded practically to our Justices of the Peace, Mayor&#x27;s Court, District Court, Circuit Court. Finally, there was a Supreme Court under Moses and his successors. These courts, though graded, did not afford an opportunity of appeal. The lower courts turned their difficult cases over to the next higher. If the case was simple, the judge over tens would take it, but if the question was too intricate for him, he would refer it to the next higher court, and so on until it finally reached Moses. There were certain kinds of questions which the tens, fifties, and hundreds would not take at all, and the people understood it and would bring them to the higher courts for original jurisdiction. When any court decided it, that was the end of that case, for it could not be appealed (Ex 18:25,26). On taking possession in Palestine, the judges were to be appointed for every city and vicinity (De 16:18), thus giving to all Israel a speedy and cheap method of adjudication. Though not so prescribed by the constitution, the judges at length were generally chosen from among the Levites, as the learned class. The office was elective. Josephus states this plainly, and various passages of the Scriptures express it positively by inference (see De 1:13). Jephthah&#x27;s election by vote of the people is clearly set forth (Jud 11:5-11).2. Character of the Judges:Among the Hebrews, the law was held very sacred; for God Himself had given it. Hence, those who administered the law were God&#x27;s special representatives, and their person was held correspondingly sacred. These circumstances placed upon them the duty of administering justice without respect to persons (De 1:17; 16:18). They were to be guided by the inalienable rights granted to every citizen by the Hebrew constitution:(1) No man was to be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law (Nu 35:9-34).(2) Two or three witnesses were required to convict anyone of crime (De 17:6; 19:2-13).(3) Punishment for crime was not to be transferred or entailed (De 24:16).(4) A man&#x27;s home was inviolate (De 24:10,11).(5) One held to bondage but having acquired liberty through his own effort should be protected (De 23:15,16).(6) One&#x27;s homestead was inalienable (Le 25:23-28,34).(7) Slavery could not be made perpetual without the person&#x27;s own consent (Ex 21:2-6).3.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">solt (berith melach; halas, classical Greek hals): As salt was regarded as a necessary ingredient of the daily food, and so of all sacrifices offered to Yahweh (Le 2:13), it became an easy step to the very close connection between salt and covenant-making. When men ate together they became friends. Compare the Arabic expression, &quot;There is salt between us&quot;; &quot;He has eaten of my salt,&quot; which means partaking of hospitality which cemented friendship; compare &quot;eat the salt of the palace&quot; (Ezr 4:14). Covenants were generally confirmed by sacrificial meals and salt was always present. Since, too, salt is a preservative, it would easily become symbolic of an enduring covenant. So offerings to Yahweh were to be by a statute forever, &quot;a covenant of salt for ever before Yahweh&quot; (Nu 18:19). David received his kingdom forever from Yahweh by a &quot;covenant of salt&quot; (2Ch 13:5). In the light of these conceptions the remark of our Lord becomes the more significant: &quot;Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another&quot; (Mr 9:50).Edward Bagby Pollard</p>

Nature of the LawsLITERATUREThe name given in Ex 24:7 to a code or collection of laws found in the preceding chapters, 20-23, as the terms of the covenant made with Yahweh, and given for Israel&#x27;s guidance until a more complete legislation should be provided. In this covenant between Yahweh and Israel, Moses served as mediator; animals were sacrificed, the blood thus shed being also called &quot;the blood of the covenant&quot; (dam haberith, Ex 24:8).1. Historical Connection:This brief book of laws occupies a fitting and dearly marked place in the Pentateuchal collection. Examination of the historical context shows that it is put where it belongs and belongs where it is put. A few months after the Exodus (Ex 19:1) Israel arrived at Sinai. Immediately at the command which Moses had received from Yahweh in the Mount, they prepared themselves by a ceremonial of sanctification for entrance into covenant relation with Yahweh. When the great day arrived for making this covenant, Moses in the midst of impressive natural phenomena went again to meet Yahweh in the top of the mountain. On his return (Ex 19:25), the words of the law, or the terms of the covenant, were declared to the people, and accepted by them. The first part of these covenant-terms, namely, the Decalogue (Ex 20:2-17), was spoken by the Divine voice, or its declaration was accompanied by awe-inspiring natural convulsions (Ex 20:18). Therefore in response to the pleadings of the terrified people Moses went up again into the mountain and received from Yahweh for them the rest of the &quot;words&quot; and &quot;ordinances&quot; (Ex 24:3); and these constitute the so-called Book of the Covenant (Ex 20:22-23). In this direct and unequivocal manner the narrator connected the book with the nation&#x27;s consecration at Sinai. The prophets regarded the making of the Sinaitic covenant as the marriage of Israel and Yahweh, and these laws were the terms mutually agreed upon in the marriage contract.2. Analysis:While it is not possible to arrange the materials of this document into hard-and-fast divisions, the following analysis may be suggestive and serviceable:(1) directions concerning worship, specifying prohibition of images and the form of altar for animal sacrifices (Ex 20:23-26);(2) ordinances for protection of Hebrew slaves, including betrothal, for a price, of daughter (Ex 21:2-11);(3) laws concerning injuries,(a) to man by man (Ex 21:12-27),(b) to man by beast (Ex 21:28-32),(c) to beast by man (Ex 21:33,14),(d) to beast by beast (Ex 21:35,36);(4) concerning theft (Ex 22:1-4);(5) concerning damage to a neighbor&#x27;s property, including violence to his daughter (Ex 22:5-17);(6) sundry laws against profaning Yahweh&#x27;s name, under which are included proper worship, avoidance of oppression and dutiful offering of first-fruits (Ex 22:18-31);(7) against various forms of injustice and unbrotherliness (Ex 23:1-9);(8) festal occasion...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">Diatheke, was the word chosen by the Septuagint translators to render the Hebrew berith, and it appears thus nearly 300 times in the Greek Old Testament in the sense of covenant, while suntheke and entolai are each used once only. The choice of this word seems to have been occasioned by a recognition that the covenant which God makes with men is not fully mutual as would be implied in suntheke, the Greek word commonly used for covenant (although not a New Testament word), while at the same time the rarity of wills among the Jews made the common sense of diatheke relatively unfamiliar. The Apocryphal writers also frequently use the same word in the same sense and no other.In the New Testament diatheke is used some thirty times in a way which makes it plain that its translation must be &quot;covenant.&quot; In Ga 3:15 and Heb 9:15-17 it is held by many that the sense of covenant must be set aside in favor of will or testament. But in the former passage it can be taken in the sense of a disposition of affairs or arrangement made by God, a conception in substantial harmony with its regular New Testament use and with the sense of berith. In the passage in Hebrews the interpretation is more difficult, but as it is acknowledged on all hands that the passage loses all argumentative force if the meaning testament is accepted, it seems best to retain the meaning covenant if possible. To do this it is only necessary to hold that the death spoken of is the death of the animal sometimes, if not, indeed, commonly slain in connection with the making of a covenant, and that in the mind of the author this death symbolized the death of the contracting parties so far at least as to pledge them that thereafter in the matter involved they would no more change their minds than can the dead. If this view is taken, this passage falls in line with the otherwise invariable use of the word diatheke by Jewish Hellenists.See TESTAMENT.LITERATURE.Lightfoot, Commentary on Gal; Ramsay, Commentary on Gal; Westcott, Commentary on Hebrews; article on Heb 9:15-17, Baptist Review and The Expositor., July, 1904.David Foster Estes</p>

Different Varieties4. Phraseology UsedIII. BETWEEN GOD AND MEN1. Essential Idea2. Covenants Recorded in the Old Testament3. Phraseology Used4. History of Covenant IdeaLITERATUREI. General Meaning.The etymological force of the Hebrew berith is not entirely certain. It is probable that the word is the same as the Assyrian biritu, which has the common meaning &quot;fetter,&quot; but also means &quot;covenant.&quot; The significance of the root from which this Assyrian word is derived is uncertain. It is probable that it is &quot;to bind,&quot; but that is not definitely established. The meaning of biritu as covenant seems to come directly from the root, rather than as a derived meaning from fetter. If this root idea is to bind, the covenant is that which binds together the parties. This, at any rate, is in harmony with the general meaning of the word.In the Old Testament the word has an ordinary use, when both parties are men, and a distinctly religious use, between God and men. There can be no doubt that the religious use has come from the ordinary, in harmony with the general custom in such cases, and not the reverse. There are also two shades of meaning, somewhat distinct, of the Hebrew word: one in which it is properly a covenant, i.e. a solemn mutual agreement, the other in which it is more a command, i.e. instead of an obligation voluntarily assumed, it is an obligation imposed by a superior upon an inferior. This latter meaning, however, has clearly been derived from the other. It is easy to see that an agreement, including as the contracting parties those of unequal position, might readily include those agreements which tended to partake of the nature of a command; but the process could not readily be reversed.II. Among Men.1. Early Idea:We consider first a covenant in which both contracting parties are men. In essence a covenant is an agreement, but an agreement of a solemn and binding force. The early Semitic idea of a covenant was doubtless that which prevailed among the Arabs (see especially W. Robertson Smith, Religion of the Semites, 2nd edition, passim). This was primarily blood-brotherhood, in which two men became brothers by drinking each other&#x27;s blood. Ordinarily this meant that one was adopted into the clan of the other. Hence, this act involved the clan of one of the contracting parties, and also brought the other party into relation with the god of this clan, by bringing him into the community life of the clan, which included its god. In this early idea, then, &quot;primarily the covenant is not a special engagement to this or that particular effect, but bond of troth and life- fellowship to all the effects for which kinsmen are permanently bound together&quot; (W. Robertson Smith, op. cit., 315 f). In this early ceremonial the religious idea was necessarily present, because the god was kindred to the clan; and the god had a special interest in the covenant because he especially p...</p>

The Mediator of the New Covenant6. &quot;Inheritance&quot; and &quot;Testament&quot;7. Relation to Jeremiah 31:31-348. To Ezekiel9. Contrast of Old and New in 2 Corinthians 31. Contrast of &quot;New&quot; and &quot;Old&quot;--the Term &quot;Covenant&quot;:The term &quot;New&quot; Covenant necessarily implies an &quot;Old&quot; Covenant, and we are reminded that God&#x27;s dealings with His people in the various dispensations of the world&#x27;s history have been in terms of covenant. The Holy Scriptures by their most familiar title keep this thought before us, the Old Testament and the New Testament or Covenant; the writings produced within the Jewish &quot;church&quot; being the writings or Scriptures of the Old Covenant, those within the Christian church, the Scriptures of the New Covenant. The alternative name &quot;Testament&quot;--adopted into our English description through the Latin, as the equivalent of the Hebrew berith, and the Greek diatheke, which both mean a solemn disposition, compact or contract--suggests the disposition of property in a last will or testament, but although the word diatheke may bear that meaning, the Hebrew berith does not, and as the Greek usage in the New Testament seems especially governed by the Old Testament usage and the thought moves in a similar plane, it is better to keep to the term &quot;covenant.&quot; The one passage which seems to favor the &quot;testament&quot; idea is Heb 9:16,17 (the Revisers who have changed the King James Version &quot;testament&quot; into &quot;covenant&quot; in every other place have left it in these two verses), but it is questionable whether even here the better rendering would not be &quot;covenant&quot; (see below). Certainly in the immediate context &quot;covenant&quot; is the correct translation and, confessedly, &quot;testament,&quot; if allowed to stand, is an application by transition from the original thought of a solemn compact to the secondary one of testamentary disposition. The theological terms &quot;Covenant of Works&quot; and &quot;Covenant of Grace&quot; do not occur in Scripture, though the ideas covered by the terms, especially the latter, may easily be found there. The &quot;New Covenant&quot; here spoken of is practically equivalent to the Covenant of Grace established between God and His redeemed people, that again resting upon the eternal Covenant of Redemption made between the Father and the Son, which, though not so expressly designated, is not obscurely indicated by many passages of Scripture.2. Christ&#x27;s Use at Last Supper:Looking at the matter more particularly, we have to note the words of Christ at the institution of the Supper. In all the three Synoptists, as also in Paul&#x27;s account (Mt 26:28; Mr 14:24; Lu 22:20; 1Co 11:25) &quot;covenant&quot; occurs. Matthew and ...</p>

Read in the light of the context: &quot;Every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head&quot; (verse 5).

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kuv&#x27;-et-us-nes: Has a variety of shades of meaning determined largely by the nature of the particular word used, or the context, or both. Following are some of the uses:(1) To gain dishonestly (batsa`), e.g. the King James Version Ex 18:21; Eze 33:31.(2) The wish to have more than one possesses, inordinately, of course (pleonexia), e.g. Lu 12:15; 1Th 2:5.(3) An inordinate love of money philarguros, the King James Version Lu 16:14; 2Ti 3:2; philarguria, 1Ti 6:10; negative in Heb 13:5, the King James Version.Covetousness is a very grave sin; indeed, so heinous is it that the Scriptures class it among the very gravest and grossest crimes (Eph 5:3). In Col 3:5 it is &quot;idolatry,&quot; while in 1Co 6:10 it is set forth as excluding a man from heaven. Its heinousness, doubtless, is accounted for by its being in a very real sense the root of so many other forms of sin, e.g. departure from the faith (1Ti 6:9,10); lying (2Ki 5:22-25); theft (Jos 7:21); domestic trouble (Pr 15:27); murder (Eze 22:12); indeed, it leads to &quot;many foolish and hurtful lusts&quot; (1Ti 6:9). Covetousness has always been a very serious menace to mankind, whether in the Old Testament or New Testament period. It was one of the first sins that broke out after Israel had entered into the promised land (Achan, Jos 7); and also in the early Christian church immediately after its founding (Ananias and Sapphira, Ac 5); hence, so many warnings against it. A careful reading of the Old Testament will reveal the fact that a very great part of the Jewish law--such as its enactments and regulations regarding duties toward the poor, toward servants; concerning gleaning, usury, pledges, gold and silver taken during war--was introduced and intended to counteract the spirit of covetousness.Eerdmans maintains (Expos, July, 1909) that the commandment, &quot;Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x27;s house&quot; (Ex 20:17), meant to the Israelite that he should not take anything of his neighbor&#x27;s possessions that were momentarily unprotected by their owner. Compare Ex 34:23 ff. Thus, it refers to a category of acts that is not covered by the commandment, &quot;Thou shalt not steal.&quot; It is an oriental habit of mind from of old that when anyone sees abandoned goods which he thinks desirable, there is not the least objection to taking them, and Ex 20:17 b is probably an explanation of what is to be understood by &quot;house&quot; in Ex 20:17 a.Examples of covetousness: Achan (Jos 7); Saul (1Sa 15:9,19); Judas (Mt 26:14,15); Ananias and Sapphira (Ac 5:1-11); Balaam (2Pe 2:15 with Jude 1:11).William Evans</p>

In Lu 20:23, Jesus perceives &quot;the craftiness&quot; of His adversaries, i.e. the complicated network which they have laid to ensnare Him. The art with which a plot is concealed, and its direction to the ruin of others, are elements that enter into the meaning. Heinrici on 1Co 3:19 illustrates from Plato the distinction between craftiness and wisdom.

Sources of Our Knowledge of the Crafts of the Bible.1. Written Records and Discoveries of Craftsmanship:Our knowledge of the arts and crafts of Bible times has come to us through two principal ways. First, from Biblical, Assyrian, Babylonian and Egyptian written records. Of these the Egyptian are the most illuminating. Second, from examples of ancient handicraft which have been buried and preserved through many centuries and brought to light again by modern discoveries.(1) Jewish.The chief written documents from which we may learn about Hebrew handicraft are the Bible records. A study of what few references there are leads us to believe that before the Israelites came in contact with the people of Canaan and Phoenicia they had not developed any considerable technical skill (1Ki 5:6; 1Ch 14:1; 2Ch 2:7,14; Ezr 3:7). Some of the simpler operations, such as the spinning and weaving of the common fabrics and the shaping of domestic utensils, were performed in the household (Ex 35:25,26) but the weaving and dyeing of fine fabrics, carving, inlaying, metal-working, etc., was the work of foreigners, or was learned by the Jews after the Exodus, from the dwellers in PalestineThe Jews, however, gradually developed skill in many of these crafts. It is believed that as early as Nehemiah&#x27;s time, Jewish craftsmen had organized into guilds (Ne 3:8,31,32). In post-Biblical times the Jews obtained monopolies in some of the industries, as for example, glass-making and dyeing. These trades remained the secrets of certain families for generations. It is because of this secrecy and the mystery that surrounded these trades, and is still maintained in many places, that we know so little as to how they were conducted. Until recently the principal indigo dyers in Damascus were Jews, and the Jews shared with Moslem craftsmen the right to make glass. In some of the Syrian cities Jewish craftsmen are now outnumbering other native workmen in certain trades.Few examples of Hebrew handicraft have been discovered by the archaeologists which shed much light upon early Hebrew work. Aside from the pottery of the Israelite period, and a few seals and coins, no traces of Hebrew workmanship remain. It is even doubtful how many of the above objects are really the work of this people.(2) Canaanitish and Phoenician.It is generally conceded that what technical skill ...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">krag (shen (1Sa 7:12; 14:4; Job 39:28 the King James Version and the English Revised Version)): In a mountainous country composed of sedimentary rocks, like the cretaceous rocks of Palestine, cliffs are formed on a slope where hard strata are underlaid by softer strata. The soft strata wear away more rapidly, undermining the hard strata above them, which for a time project, but finally break off by vertical joint planes, the fragments rolling down to form the talus slope at the foot of the cliff. As the breaking off of the undermined hard strata proceeds irregularly, there are left projecting crags, sometimes at the top of the cliff, and sometimes lower down. Two such crags (shen ha-cela`, &quot;sharp rock,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;rocky crag&quot;), which were given particular names, Bozez and Seneh, marked the scene of the exploit of Jonathan described in 1Sa 14. Conder failed to identify the crags, and it has been proposed to alter the text rather extensively to make it read: &quot;wall of rock&quot; instead of &quot;crag&quot; (Encyclopedia Biblica, under the word &quot;Michmash&quot;). Such rocks form safe resting-places for birds of prey, as it is said of the eagle in Job 39:28 English Revised Version:  &quot;She dwelleth on the rock and hath her lodging there, Upon the crag of the rock, and the stronghold.&quot;  Alfred Ely Day</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kran (`aghur; geranos; Latin Grus cinerea): A bird of the family gruidae. The crane is mentioned twice in the Bible: once on account of its voice (Isa 38:14: &quot;Like a swallow or a crane, so did I chatter&quot;); again because of the unforgettable picture these birds made in migration (Jer 8:7): &quot;Yea, the stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle-dove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the law of Yahweh.&quot; Some commentators have adduced reasons for dropping the crane from the ornithology of the Bible, but this never should be permitted. They were close relatives of stork, heron and ibis; almost as numerous as any of these, and residents of Palestine, except in migration. The two quotations concerning them fit with their history, and point out the two features that made them as noticeable as any birds of Palestine. Next to the ostrich and pelican they were the largest birds, having a wing sweep of 8 ft. from tip to tip and standing 4 ft. in height. In migration such immense flocks passed over Palestine as to darken the sky, and when they crossed the Red Sea they appeared to sweep from shore to shore, and so became the most noticeable migratory bird, for which reason, no doubt, they were included in Isaiah&#x27;s reference to spring migration with the beloved doves, used in sacrifice and for caged pets, and with the swallows that were held almost sacred because they homed in temples. Not so many of them settled in Palestine as of the storks, but large flocks lived in the wilderness South of Jerusalem, and a few pairs homed near water as far north as Merom. The grayish-brown cranes were the largest, and there were also a crested, and a white crane. They nested on the ground or in trees and laid two large eggs, differing with species. The eggs of the brown bird were a light drab with brown speckles, and those of the white, rough, pale-blue with brown splotches. They were not so affectionate in pairs or to their young as storks, but were average parents. It is altogether probable that they were the birds intended by Isaiah, because they best suited his purpose, the crane and the swallow being almost incessant talkers among birds. The word &quot;chatter,&quot; used in the Bible, exactly suits the notes of a swallow, but is much too feeble to be used in describing the vocalizing of the crane. They migrated in large wedge-shaped companies and cried constantly on wing. They talked incessantly while at the business of living, and even during the watches of the night they scarcely ceased passing along word that all was well, or sending abroad danger signals. The Arabs called the cry of the cranes &quot;bellowing.&quot; We usually express it by whooping or trumpeting. Any of these words is sufficiently expressive to denote an unusual voice, used in an unusual manner, so that it appealed to the prophet as suitable for use in a strong comparison.Gene Stratton-Porter</p>

Creation as Abiding:Much negative ground has been cleared away for any modern discussion of the doctrine of creation. No idea of creation can now be taken as complete which does not include, besides the world as at first constituted, all that to this day is in and of creation. For God creates not being that can exist independently of Him, His preserving agency being inseparably connected with His creative power. We have long ceased to think of God&#x27;s creation as a machine left, completely made, to its own automatic working. With such a doctrine of creation, a theistic evolution would be quite incompatible.2. Mistaken Ideas:Just as little do we think of God&#x27;s creative agency, as merely that of a First Cause, linked to the universe from the outside by innumerable sequences of causes and effects. Nature in her entirety is as much His creation today as she ever was. The dynamic ubiquity of God, as efficient energy, is to be affirmed. God is still All and in All, but this in a way sharply distinguished from pantheistic views, whether of the universe as God, or of God as the universe. Of His own freedom He creates, so that Gnostic theories of natural and necessary emanation are left far behind. Not only have the &quot;carpenter&quot; and the &quot;gardener&quot; theories--with, of course, the architect or world-builder theory of Plato-- been dismissed; not only has the conception of evolution been proved harmonious with creative end, plan, purpose, ordering, guidance; but evolutionary science may itself be said to have given the thought of theistic evolution its best base or grounding. The theistic conception is, that the world--that all cosmic existences, substances, events-- depend upon God.3. True Conception:The doctrine of creation--of the origin and persistence, of all finite existences--as the work of God, is a necessary postulation of the religious consciousness. Such consciousness is marked by deeper insight than belongs to science. The underlying truth is the anti-patheistic one, that the energy and wisdom--by which that, which was not, became--were, in kind, other than its own. For science can but trace the continuity of sequences in all Nature, while in creation, in its primary sense, this law of continuity must be transcended, and the world viewed solely as product of Divine Intelligence, immanent in its evolution. For God is the Absolute Reason, always immanent in the developing universe. Apart from the cosmogonic attempts at the beginning of Genesis, which are clearly religious and ethical in scope and character, the Old Testament furnishes no the...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kre-a&#x27;-ter (ktistes, 1Pe 4:19): The distinctive characteristic of Deity, as the Creator, is that He is the Cause of the existent universe--Cause of its being, not merely of its evolution or present arrangements.1. God as Creator:The doctrine of His being the Creator implies, that is to say, that He is the real and the exclusive Agent in the production of the world. For, as Herder remarked, the thought of the Creator is the most fruitful of all our ideas. As Creator, He is the Unconditioned, and the All-conditioning, Being. The universe is thus dependent upon Him, as its causative antecedent. He calls it, as Aquinas said, &quot;according to its whole substance,&quot; into being, without any presupposed basis. His power, as Creator, is different in kind from finite power. But the creative process is not a case of sheer almightiness, creating something out of nothing, but an expression of God, as the Absolute Reason, under the forms of time and space, causality and finite personality. In all His work, as Creator, there is no incitement from without, but it rather remains an eternal activity of self- manifestation on the part of a God who is Love.2. Purpose in Creation:God&#x27;s free creative action is destined to realize archetypal ends and ideals, which are peculiar to Himself. For thought cannot be content with the causal category under which He called the world into being, but must run on to the teleological category, wherein He is assumed to have created with a purpose, which His directive agency will see at last fulfilled. As Creator, He is distinct from the universe, which is the product of the free action of His will. This theistic postulation of His freedom, as Creator, rules out all theories of necessary emanation. His creative action was in no way necessarily eternal--not even necessary to His own blessedness or perfection, which must be held as already complete in Himself. To speak, as Professor James does, of &quot;the stagnant felicity of the Absolute&#x27;s own perfection&quot; is to misconceive the infinite plenitude of His existence, and to place Him in a position of abject and unworthy dependence upon an eternal activity of world-making.3. Relation to Time:God&#x27;s action, as Creator, does not lower our conception of His changelessness, for it is a gratuitous assumption to suppose either that the will to create was a sudden or accidental thing, or that He could not will a change, without, in any proper sense, changing His will. Again, grave difficulties cluster around the conception of His creative thought or purpose as externalized in time, the chief source of the trouble being, as is often imperfectly realized, that, in attempting to view things as they were when time began, we are really trying to get out of, and beyond, experience, to the thinking of which time is an indispensable condition. God&#x27;s work as Creator must have taken place in time, since the world must be held as no necessary element in the Absolute Life.4. Christ in Creation:The self-determined ac...</p>

Nephesh, &quot;living creature&quot; (literally, &quot;a breathing thing&quot;), occurs in the accounts of the Creation and the Flood and at the close of the lists of clean and unclean animals in Le 11:46. Chay, &quot;living creature&quot; (literally, &quot;a living thing&quot;), occurs 13 times in Eze 1; 3 and 10 (see CREATURE, LIVING). Sherets, &quot;moving creature&quot; (literally, &quot;a swarming thing,&quot; generally rendered &quot;creeping thing,&quot; which see), occurs once in Ge 1:20. &#x27;Ochim, &quot;doleful creatures,&quot; occurs once only in Isa 13:21. It appears to be an onomatopoetic word referring to the mournful sounds emitted by the animals in question.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(chayyah; zoon): &quot;Living creature&quot; (chayyah) is the designation of each of the composite figures in Ezekiel&#x27;s visions (Eze 1:5,13 ff; 3:13; 10:15,17,20) and, the Revised Version (British and American), of the similar beings in the visions of the Apocalypse, instead of the extremely unfortunate translation of zoon in the King James Version by &quot;beasts&quot; (Re 4:6 ff; 5:6 ff; 6:1 ff; 7:11; 14:3; 15:7; 19:4), which, however, went back to Wycliff, in whose time the word had not the low meaning which &quot;beast,&quot; &quot;beastly&quot; have with us; hence, he translates 1Co 15:44, &quot;It is sowen beestli body,&quot; meaning simply animal (see Trench&#x27;s Select Glossary); in Re &quot;the beasts of the earth,&quot; the &quot;beasts&quot; that came up, the notable &quot;beast&quot; that men worshipped, represent the Greek therion, &quot;a wild beast.&quot;The &quot;living creatures&quot; in Ezekiel&#x27;s vision (Eze 1:5 ff) were four in number, &quot;with the general appearance of a man, but each with four faces and four wings, and straight legs with the feet of an ox. Under their wings are human hands, and these wings are so joined that they never require to turn. The front face is that of a man; right and left of this are the faces of a lion and (of) an ox, and behind, that of an eagle .... out of the midst of them gleam fire, torches, lightnings, and connected with them are four wheels that can turn in every direction, called whirling wheels (Eze 10:12,13). Like the creatures, these are alive, covered with eyes, the sign of intelligence; the spirit of the living creatures is in them. They are afterward discovered by the prophet to be cherubim&quot; (Schultz, Old Testament Theology, II, 233). See CHERUBIM. In Ezekiel&#x27;s vision they seem to be the bearers of the throne and glory of God; the bearers of His presence and of His revelation (Eze 9:3; 10:3). They also sound forth His praise (Eze 3:12; 10:2). (See Schultz as above.)The four living creatures in Re 4:6 are not under the throne but &quot;in the midst of the throne&quot; (the American Revised Version, margin &quot;before&quot;; see Re 7:17; compare Re 5:6) and &quot;round about the throne.&quot; They are also cherubim, and seem to represent the four beings that stand at the head of the four divisions of the creation; among the untamed animals the lion; among cattle the calf or ox; among birds the eagle; among all created beings the man. It gives &quot;a perfect picture of true service, which should be as brave as the lion, patient as the ox, aspiring as the eagle, intelligent as man&quot; (Milligan in the place cited.). They represent the powers of Nature--of the creation, &quot;full of eyes&quot; as denoting its permeation with the Divine Reason, the wings signifying its constant, ready service, and the unceasing praise the constant doing of God&#x27;s will. The imagery is founded on Ezekiel as that had been modified in apocalyptic writings and as it was exalted in the mind of the Seer of Patmos.W. L. Walker</p>

In Ps 109:11 he is the extortioner; in Pr 29:13 the oppressor is evidently the creditor, though a different word is used; compare also Pr 22:7. In Sirach 29:28 the importunity of the creditor is one of the hardships of the poor man of understanding.

The Reformation CreedsLITERATUREBy &quot;creed&quot; we understand the systematic statement of religious faith; and by the creeds of the Christian church we mean the formal expression of &quot;the faith which was delivered unto the saints.&quot; The word is derived from the first word of the Latin versions of the Apostles&#x27; Creed, and the name is usually applied to those formulas known as the Apostles&#x27;, the Nicene and the Athanasian creeds.In this article we shall first indicate the Scriptural foundation and rudimentary Biblical statements upon which the distinctive dogmas of the church are based; and, secondly, briefly describe the origin and nature of the three most important symbols of belief which have dominated Christian thought.I. Scriptural Basis.There are three forms in which the religious instinct naturally expresses itself--in a ritual, a creed and a life. Men first seek to propitiate the Deity by some outward act and express their devotion in some external ceremony. Next they endeavor to explain their worship and to find a rationale of it in certain facts which they formulate into a confession; and lastly, not content with the outward act or the verbal interpretation of it, they attempt to express their religion in life.Pagan religion first appears in the form of a rite. The worshipper was content with the proper performance of a ceremony and was not, in the earliest stage at least, concerned with an interpretation of his act. The myths, which to some extent were an attempt to rationalize ritual, may be regarded as the earliest approach to a formulated statement of belief. But inasmuch as the myths of early pagan religion are not obligatory upon the reason or the faith of the worshipper, they can scarcely be regarded as creeds. Pagan religion, strictly speaking, has no theology and having no real historical basis of facts does not possess the elements of a creed. In this respect it is distinguished from revealed religion. This latter rests upon facts, the meaning and interpretation of which are felt to be necessary to give to revelation its values and authority.1. In the Old Testament:Even in the Old Testament there are not wanting the germs of a creed. In the Decalogue we have the beginnings of the formulation of belief, and in the proclamation, &quot;Hear, O Israel: Yahweh our God is one Yahweh&quot; (De 6:4), we have what may be regarded as the symbol of the Old Testament faith and the earliest attempt to enunciate a doctrine.2. In the New Testament--Gospels:It is to the New Testament, however, we must turn to find the real indications of such a statement of belief as may be designated a creed. We must remember that Christ lived and taught...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">krep&#x27;-ing (remes, sherets; herpeton): Remes and sherets, with the root verbs ramas and sharats, are used without any sharp distinction for insects and other small creatures. Ramas means clearly &quot;to creep,&quot; and is used even of the beasts of the forest (Ps 104:20), while sharats is rather &quot;to swarm.&quot; But in at least one passage (Le 11:44), we have the noun, sherets, with the verb ramas; &quot;with any manner of creeping thing that moveth upon the earth.&quot; The principal passages where these words occur are the accounts of the Creation and the Flood and the references to unclean animals in Le and in the vision of Peter. In the last we have the word herpeton as the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew words (Ac 10:12). Winged creeping things (sherets ha-`oph, Le 11:20 ff), as well as the wingless, are unclean, but an exception is made in favor of the locusts, &quot;which have legs above their feet, where-with to leap upon the earth.&quot;See INSECTS; LOCUST.Alfred Ely Day</p>

Even among the Greeks, bodies were often buried without being burned (Thuc. i. 134,6; Plato Phaedo 115 E; Plut. Lyc. xxvii). Cicero thought that burial was the more ancient practice, though among the Romans both methods were in use in his day (De leg. ii.22,56). Lucian (De luctu xxi) expressly says that, while the Greeks burned their dead, the Persians buried them (see BURIAL, and compare 2Sa 21:12-14). In the case supposed by Amos 6:10, when it is predicted that Yahweh, in abhorrence of &quot;the excellency of Jacob,&quot; shall &quot;deliver up the city,&quot; and, &quot;if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die,&quot; and &quot;a man&#x27;s kinsman (ARVm) shall take him up, even he that burneth him,&quot; etc., the suggestion seems to be that of pestilence with accompanying infection, and that this, or the special judgment of Yahweh, is why burning is preferred. When Paul (1Co 13:3) speaks of giving his body to be burned, he is simply accommodating his language to the customs of Corinth. (But see Plutarch on Zarmanochegas, and C. Beard, The Universal Christ.)How far religious, or sanitary, or practical reasons were influential in deciding between the different methods, it is impossible to say. That bodies were burned in times of pestilence in the Valley of Hinnom at Jerusalem is without support (see Eze 39:11-16). The &quot;very great burning&quot; at the burial of Asa (2Ch 16:14) is not a case of cremation, but of burning spices and furniture in the king&#x27;s honor (compare Jer 34:5). Nor is 1Ki 13:2 a case in point; it is simply a prophecy of a king who shall take the bones of men previously buried, and the priests of the high places that burn incense in false worship, and cause them to be burned on the defiled altar to further pollute it and render it abominable.There is in the New Testament no instance of cremation, Jewish, heathen or Christian, and clearly the early Christians followed the Jewish practice of burying the dead (see Tert., Apol., xlii; Minuc. Felix, Octav., xxxix; Aug., De civ. Dei, i.12,13). Indeed, cremation has never been popular among Christians, owing largely, doubtless, to the natural influence of the example of the Jews, the indisputable fact that Christ was buried, the vivid hope of the resurrection and the more or less material views concerning it prevalent here and there at this time or that. While there is nothing anti-Christian in it, and much in sanitary considerations to call for it in an age of science, it is not likely that it will ever become the prevailing practice of Christendom.George B.

An island of considerable extent (156 miles long, and from 7 to 30 miles broad), in several districts very fertile and possessing one or two good harbors, it seems marked out by its position for an important role in the history of the eastern Mediterranean. But never since an age which was already legendary when Greek history began has Crete occupied a dominating position among the powers of the surrounding continents. Internal dissensions, due in ancient times to the diversity of races inhabiting its soil (Eteocretans--the original inhabitants--Pelasgians, Acheans, Cydonians and Dorians), and in modern times to the fact that a large minority of the population has accepted the Ottoman religion along with Ottoman government, have kept Crete in a position of political inferiority throughout the historical period.1. Early History:Mt. Ida in Crete was famous in Greek legend as the birthplace of Zeus. The half-legendary, half-historical King Minos was said to be the son of Zeus, and to have derived from his father the wisdom to which, by a type of myth common in Greek lands, the constitution of the Cretan cities was ascribed. Minos was accepted as a historical personage by Thucydides and Aristotle, who say that he was the first dynast in Greece to establish dominion on the sea. One of his exploits was the suppression of piracy in Cretan waters, a feat which had to be repeated by the Roman Pompeius at a later period. Aristotle compares the Cretan institutions with those of Sparta; the island was said to have been colonized by Dorians from Peloponnesus (Politics ii.10). The most important cities in Crete were Knossos (whose palace has been excavated with fruitful results by Mr. Arthur Evans), Gortyna, near the Gulf of Messara, and Cydonia, with its river Iardanus. The excavations of Mr. Evans at Knossos and of the Italians at Phastos (near Fair Havens) prove that Crete was a center of Mediterranean civilization in an early age. In the Homeric poems, Crete is said to have contained an hundred cities; at that period the Cretans were still famed as daring sailors. In the classical age of Greek history they never held a leading position. They are mentioned chiefly as traders and mercenary soldiers, skilled especially in archery. During the Hellenistic period Crete remained free. Demetrius Nicator made the island his base of operations before his defeat at Azotus in ...</p>

The muezzin of the Moslems, who at the five appointed times of prayer mounts the minaret and calls the faithful to prayer, is another striking example.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">krim, krimz: This. term is used in English as the equivalent of the Hebrew mishpaT, &quot;judgment,&quot; &quot;verdict&quot; (Eze 7:23); zimmah, &quot;a heinous crime&quot; (Job 31:11); &#x27;asham = &quot;a fault,&quot; &quot;sin&quot; (Ge 26:10, English Versions of the Bible &quot;guiltiness&quot;); and Greek aitia, &quot;case,&quot; &quot;cause&quot; (Ac 25:27, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;charges&quot;). In the King James Version Joh 18:38; 19:4,6, the rendition is &quot;fault.&quot;egklema, &quot;indictment,&quot; &quot;charge&quot; (Ac 25:16 the King James Version) is changed in the Revised Version (British and American) to &quot;matter.&quot; A crime is a transgression against the public right; serious offense against the law; a base weakness or iniquity, all of which are regarded by the Bible as offenses against(1) God, or(2) man, or(3) both.An injury to the creature is regarded as obnoxious to the Creator. Specific forms of crime are the following:Adultery.See separate article.Assassination.This term does not occur in the English Versions of the Bible, but, of course, is included in the more general &quot;to kill,&quot; or &quot;to slay&quot; (haragh = &quot;to smite with deadly intent&quot; &quot;destroy,&quot; &quot;kill,&quot; &quot;murder,&quot; &quot;put to death&quot;). The law distinguished between unpremeditated and premeditated slaying, pronouncing a curse upon the latter (De 27:25). David expresses the deepest abhorrence of such an act (2Sa 4:9-12). Instances are found recorded in Jud 3:15-22; 2Sa 3:27; 4:5-7; 13:28,29; 20:9,10; 2Ki 12:20; 19:37; Isa 37:38. See also separate article.Bestiality.According to Webster: &quot;unnatural connection with a beast.&quot; This form of vice was treated by the Mosaic law as something exceedingly loathsome and abhorrent, calling for extreme language in its description and rigorous measures in its punishment. Both the beast and the guilty human were to be put to death (Ex 22:19; Le 18:23; 20:15,16; De 27:21), in order, as the Talmud says, to obliterate all memory of the crime.Blasphemy.See separate article.Breach of Covenant.Breach of Covenant (parar &#x27;eth ha-berith).--According to Poucher (HDB, article &quot;Crimes&quot;), this term included:(1) failure to observe the Day of Atonement (Le 23:29); work on that day (Le 23:28);(2) sacrifice of children to Moloch (Le 20:3);(3) neglect of circumcision (Ge 17:14; Ex 4:26);(4) unauthorized manufacture of the holy oil (Ex 30:33);(5) anointing an alien therewith (Ex 30:33);(6) neglect of the Passover (Nu 9:13).Note also the following: Ge 17:14; Le 26:15-44; De 29:25; 31:16,20.

Thesis:In Jer 7:22,23 we read: &quot;For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices: but this thing I commanded them, saying, Hearken unto my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people.&quot; It is the contention of the present article that this statement of the prophet is correct (compare II, 5).More specifically, it is contended that evidence can be produced from the Old Testament to show that Israel&#x27;s religion can be seen in a long period of growth; and in this growth a fixed sacrificial law, with a minutely regulated ritual obligatory on all Israelites, the culmination and not the beginning of the process. It is contended, moreover, that this conception of the development of the institutional side of the religion of the Old Testament is attained by the strictest evaluation of all the Old Testament evidence and by no a priori considerations.2. Historical Perspective:To be sure, one is met at once in the Old Testament by what seem to be complete denials of this point of view. In the Pentateuch we find statement after statement that a given law was due not to some late author but to Moses himself, and there are numerous passages in the historical books (most notably in Chronicles) that speak of these laws as in effect from the earliest times. Such evidence must be paid all possible respect and must be overruled only on the most imperative considerations.However, if for the moment the books of the Old Testament be viewed only as historical documents, it will be admitted that the possibility of overruling such evidence may well arise. And it may very well arise without calling in question in the slightest degree the good faith of the writers of questioned passages; for an acquisition of historical perspective comes very late in intellectual evolution, particularly--though not only--in the realm of religious history. Even the trained scholar has to be on his guard lest he read back the concepts of his own time into some past generation, while the non-specialist never succeeds in avoiding this error completely. For the uncultured mind, especially for the Oriental, the problem scarcely exists. That which is generally accepted and which is not obviously novel tends to be classified as that which &quot;always has been.&quot; A law so old that its actual source is forgotten is referred as a matter of course to some great lawgiver of the past.

Such a survey will show the legitimacy and indispensableness of a truly scientific criticism, at the same time that it warns against the hasty acceptance of Speculative and hypothetical constructions. Criticism is more than a description of phenomena; it implies a process of sifting, testing, proving, sometimes with the result of establishing, often with that of modifying or reversing, traditional opinions. Criticism goes wrong when used recklessly, or under the influence of some dominant theory or prepossession. A chief cause of error in its application to the record of a supernatural revelation is the assumption that nothing supernatural can happen. This is the vitiating element in much of the newer criticism, both of the Old Testament and of the New Testament.I. Divisions.1. Lower or Textual Criticism:Criticism of Scripture (&quot;Biblical criticism&quot;) is usually divided into what is called &quot;lower or textual criticism&quot; and &quot;higher criticism&quot;--the latter a phrase round which many misleading associations gather. &quot;Lower criticism&quot; deals strictly with the text of Scripture, endeavoring to ascertain what the real text of each book was as it came from the hands of its author; &quot;higher criticism&quot; concerns itself with the resultant problems of age, authorship, sources, simple or composite character, historical worth, relation to period of origin, etc.2. Higher Criticism:The former--&quot;textual criticism&quot;--has a well-defined field in which it is possible to apply exact canons of judgment: the latter--&quot;higher criticism&quot;--while invaluable as an aid in the domain of Biblical introduction (date, authorship, genuineness, contents, destination, etc.), manifestly tends to widen out illimitably into regions where exact science cannot follow it, where, often, the critic&#x27;s imagination is his only law.It was only gradually that these two branches of ...</p>

It was by no means uncommon in ancient Egypt, where I have found a considerable number of spines affected with this disease. Some Talmudic authorities explain it as meaning &quot;very dark colored,&quot; but this is unlikely.The woman bound by the spirit of infirmity and unable to lift herself (Lu 13:11-17) was affected with senile kyphosis, a chronic bone disease often found among aged men (and more frequently women) whose lives have been spent in agricultural labor. In these the vertebrae become altered in shape so that it is impossible to straighten the back. Some rabbinical authorities believed all deformities to be due to Satan, and to this our Lord seems to have alluded in his rebuke to those who caviled at His healing on the Sabbath. I have found this condition in some Egyptian skeletons, and have seen it in a Palestinian fellah. A skeleton affected with a similar curvature was found buried under the threshold of a house at Gezer, where she had evidently been offered as a foundation sacrifice.Alex. Macalister</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(stauros, &quot;a cross,&quot; &quot;the crucifixion&quot;; skolops, &quot;a stake,&quot; &quot;a pole&quot;): The name is not found in the Old Testament. It is derived from the Latin word crux. In the Greek language it is stauros, but sometimes we find the word skolops used as its Greek equivalent. The historical writers, who transferred the events of Roman history into the Greek language, make use of these two words. No word in human language has become more universally known than this word, and that because all of the history of the world since the death of Christ has been measured by the distance which separates events from it. The symbol and principal content of the Christian religion and of Christian civilization is found in this one word.1. Forms of the Cross:The cross occurs in at least four different forms:(1) the form usually seen in pictures, the crux immissa, in which the upright beam projected above the shorter crosspiece; this is most likely the type of cross on which the Saviour died, as may be inferred from the inscription which was nailed above His head;(2) the crux commissa, or Anthony&#x27;s cross, which has the shape of the letter T;(3) the Greek cross of later date, in which the pieces are equally long;(4) the crux decussata, or Andrew&#x27;s cross, which has the shape of the letter X.2. Discovery of the True Cross:The early church historians Socrates (1, 17), Sozomen (2, 1), Rufinus (1, 7) and Theodoret (1, 18) all make mention of this tradition. The most significant thing is that Eusebius (Vit. Const., iii.26-28), who carries more weight than they all together, wholly omits it.According to it, Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great, in 325 AD, when she was 79 years old, discovered the true cross of Jesus by an excavation she caused to be made on the traditional spot of His grave. With the cross of the Saviour were found the two crosses of the malefactors who were crucified with Him. A miracle of healing, wrought by touching the true cross, revealed its identity. Whenfound it was intact, even the holy nails of the crucifixion being discovered. The main part of the cross was deposited by Helena in a church erected over the spot. Of the remainder, a portion was inserted into the head of the statue of Constantine, and the balance was placed in a new church, specially erected for it at Rome and named after it Santa Croce. Small fragments of the wood of the true cross were sold, encrusted with gold and jewels, and since many among the wealthy believers were desirous of possessing such priceless relics, the miracle of the &quot;multiplication of the cross&quot; was devised, so that the relic suffered no diminution &quot;et quasi intacta maneret&quot; (Paulinus epistle 11 ad Sev). Fragments of the true cross are thus to be found in many Roman Catholic churches of many countries, all over Christendom. It is said that the East celebrated the staurosimos hemera (Crucifixion Day) on September 14, since the 4th century. The evidence for this fact is late and untrustworthy. It is certain that the West...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kroun: The word crown in the Old Testament is a translation of five different Hebrew words, and in the New Testament of two Greek words. These express the several meanings, and must be examined to ascertain the same.1. In Hebrew:The five Hebrew words are as follows:(1) qodhqodh, from qadhadh;(2) zer, from zarar;(3) nezer, or nezer, both from nazar;(4) aTarah, from `atar;(5) kether, from kathar.(1) Qodhqodh means &quot;the crown of the head,&quot; and is also rendered in the King James Version &quot;top of the head,&quot; &quot;scalp,&quot; &quot;pate.&quot; It comes from qadhadh, meaning &quot;to shrivel up,&quot; &quot;contract,&quot; or bend the body or neck through courtesy. Both the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version, in De 28:35 and 33:16, translation it &quot;crown&quot; instead of &quot;top&quot; as in the King James Version. Jacob in his prophecy concerning his sons says: &quot;The blessings of thy father .... shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that is prince among his brethren&quot; (Ge 49:26 the American Revised Version, margin). Other references are: De 33:20; 2Sa 14:25; Job 2:7; Isa 3:17; Jer 2:16; 48:45. Translated &quot;scalp&quot; in Ps 68:21 and &quot;pate&quot; in Ps 7:16.(2) Zer means a &quot;chaplet,&quot; something spread around the top as a molding about the border, and because of its wreath-like appearance called a crown. &quot;That which presses, binds&quot; (BDB). Comes from zarar, meaning &quot;to diffuse&quot; or &quot;scatter.&quot; It is used in Ex 25:11,24,25; 30:3,1; 37:2,11,12,26,27.(3) Nezer means something &quot;set apart&quot;; i.e. a dedication to the priesthood or the dedication of a Nazarite, hence, a chaplet or fillet as a symbol of such consecration. The word in the King James Version is rendered &quot;crown,&quot; &quot;consecration,&quot; &quot;separation,&quot; &quot;hair.&quot; Comes from nazar, meaning &quot;to hold aloof&quot; from impurity, even from drink and food, more definitely, &quot;to set apart&quot; for sacred purposes, i.e. &quot;to separate,&quot; &quot;devote,&quot; &quot;consecrate.&quot; It is found in Ex 29:6; 39:30; Le 8:9; 21:12; 2Sa 1:10; 2Ki 11:12; 2Ch 23:11; Ps 89:39; 132:18; Pr 27:24; Zec 9:16.(4) `ATarah means a crown in the usual sense. Comes from `aTar, meaning &quot;to encircle,&quot; as in war for offense or defense; also actually and figuratively &quot;to crown.&quot; Rendered sometimes &quot;to compass.&quot; It is used in 2Sa 12:30; 1Ch 20:2; Es 8:15; Job 19:9; 31:36; Ps 21:3; Pr 4:9; 12:4; 14:24; 16:31; 17:6; So 3:11; Isa 28:1,3,1; 62:3; Jer 13:18; La 5:16; Eze 16:12; 21:26; 23:42; Zec 6:11,14; &quot;crowned,&quot; So 3:11; &quot;crownest,&quot; Ps 65:11; &quot;crowneth,&quot; Ps 103:4. the Revised Version (British and American) translations &quot;crowned,&quot; of Ps 8:5 &quot;hast crowned.&quot; the American Standard Revised Version prefers to translation &quot;crowning,&quot; in Isa 23:8, &quot;the bestower of crowns.&quot;(5) Kether means a &quot;circlet&quot; or &quot;a diadem.&quot; From kathar, meaning &quot;to enclose&quot;: as a friend, &quot;to crown&quot;; as an enemy, &quot;to besiege.&quot; Variously translated &quot;beset round,&quot; &quot;inclose round,&quot; &quot;suffer,&quot; &quot;compass about.&quot; Found in Es 1:11; 2:17, 6:8; &quot;crowned,&quot; in Pr 14:18.2.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">thornz (akdnthinos stephanos): Three of the four evangelists mention the crown of thorns, wherewith the rude Roman soldiers derided the captive Christ (Mt 27:29; Mr 15:17; Joh 19:2). All speak of the akanthine (Acanthus) crown, but there is no certainty about the peculiar plant, from the branches of which this crown of cruel mockery was plaited. The rabbinical books. mention no less than twenty-two words in the Bible signifying thorny plants, and the word akantha in the New Testament Greek is a generic and not a specific term. And this word or its adjective is used in the three Gospels, quoted above. It is therefore impossible definitely to determine what was the exact plant or tree, whose thorny branches were selected for this purpose. Tobler (Denkbl., 113, 179) inclines to the Spina Christi, as did Hasselquist. Its botanical name is Zizyphus Spina Christi, It is very common in the East. Its spines are small and sharp, its branches soft, round and pliable, and the leaves look like ivy, with a dark, shiny green color, making them therefore very adaptable to the purpose of the soldiers. Others have designated the Paliurus aculeatus or the Lycium horridum. Both Geikie (Life of Christ, 549) and Farrar (Life of Christ, note 625) point to the Nubk (Zizyphus lotus). Says the latter, &quot;The Nubk struck me, as it has all travelers in Palestine, as being most suitable both for mockery and pain, since its leaves are bright and its thorns singularly strong. But though the Nubk is very common on the shores of Galilee, I saw none of it near Jerusalem.&quot; The settlement of the question is manifestly impossible.Henry E. Dosker</p>

The word &quot;cruelty&quot; has nearly disappeared from the Bible. In the Revised Version (British and American) it occurs only in Ps 27:12. The King James Version has it in Ge 49:5; Ps 74:20 (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;violence&quot;); Eze 34:4 (perekh, &quot;crushing,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;rigor&quot;).The Old Testament records many acts on the part of chosen individuals and the elect nation which are marked by gross cruelty, particularly when measured by the leaders are standards of our own age. Some of these acts are sanctioned by Scripture or even presented as commanded by God, as, for example, the sacrifice of Isaac, the extermination of the Canaanites, the authorization of the avenger of blood and of human slavery, and of retaliation for evil. Some of the deeds performed by Divinely appointed of Israel are characterized by inhumanity. Samuel &quot;hewed Agag in pieces&quot; (1Sa 15:33). David massacred the Ammonites with great barbarity (2Sa 12:31). Elijah slew the prophets of Baal (1Ki 18:40; compare 2Ki 1:10; 10:25). Some of the utterances of the Psalmists breathe spirit of hate and revenge, as in the so-called imprecatory psalms (Ps 137:8,9; 139:21 f). This has often been a matter of great perplexity to the devout student of the Bible. He has found it difficult to reconcile such practices, which bear the stamp of Divine approval, with the highest standards of Christian morality. It is sometimes urged in justification that these deeds are permitted, but not commanded by God. But this answer if we recognize the fact, which Jesus emphasizes, that the in attendant cruelties and horrors. The Old Testament religion is a self-accommodation to the low moral standard of those whom it was designed to instruct. This He reiterates in the Sermon on the Mount (Mt 5:22,28,34), and affirms in His reference to the hardness of the ancestral Jewish heart (Mt 19:8). In the Old Testament we are dealing with the childhood of the world, in which revelation is compelled to limit itself to the comprehension of its subjects. It must speak so that they can understand. It must start with them where it finds them. It walk, that character may grow step by step. A gradual development of spiritual and ...</p>

This the Greeks called krustallos, &quot;ice,&quot; believing it to have been formed from water by intense cold. Thus in Re 4:6; 21:11; 22:1, either &quot;crystal&quot; (EV) or &quot;ice&quot; (Greek, krustallos) suits the context. The word rendered &quot;crystal&quot; in Eze 1:22 (qerach) is ambiguous in precisely the same way (the Revised Version, margin &quot;ice&quot;). In Job 28:17 the context favors the King James Version &quot;crystal,&quot; rather than the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;glass&quot; (zekhukhith). Finally, in Job 28:18 the Revised Version (British and American) reads &quot;crystal&quot; for the King James Version &quot;pearls&quot; (Hebrew gabhish; the weight of evidence favors the Revised Version (British and American) in spite of the parallelism suggested by the King James Version).See also STONES, PRECIOUS.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ku&#x27;-bit (&#x27;ammah; pechus): The standard for measures of length among the Hebrews. They derived it from the Babylonians, but a similar measure was used in Egypt with which they must have been familiar. The length of the cubit is variously estimated, since there seems to have been a double standard in both countries, and because we have no undisputed example of the cubit remaining to the present time. The original cubit was the length of the forearm, from the elbow to the end of the middle finger, as is implied from the derivation of the word in Hebrew and in Latin (cubitum). It seems to be referred to also in De 3:11: &quot;after the cubit of a man.&quot; But this was too indefinite for a scientific standard, and the Babylonians early adopted a more accurate method of measurement which passed to the nations of the West. They had a double standard, the so-called royal cubit and the ordinary one. From the remains of buildings in Assyria and Babylonia, the former is made out to be about 20,6 inches, and a cubit of similar length was used in Egypt and must have been known to the Hebrews. This was probably the cubit mentioned by Eze 40:5 and perhaps that of Solomon&#x27;s temple, &quot;cubits after the first measure&quot; (2Ch 3:3), i.e. the ancient cubit. The ordinary cubit of commerce was shorter, and has been variously estimated at between 16 and 18 or more inches, but the evidence of the Siloam inscription and of the tombs in Palestine seems to indicate 17,6 inches as the average length. See WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. This was the cubit of six palms, while the longer one was of seven (Eze 40:5). The cubit mentioned in Jud 3:16 is from a different word in Hebrew (gomedh) and was probably shorter, for Ehud girded it on his thigh under his clothing.The New Testament references are Mt 6:27; Lu 12:25, &quot;Which of you .... can add a cubit unto the measure of his life?&quot;; Joh 21:18, &quot;about two hundred cubits off&quot;; Re 21:17, &quot;the wall thereof, a hundred and forty and four cubits.&quot;H.

It was mentioned twice in the Bible (Le 11:16, and practically the same in De 14:15 the King James Version &quot;cuckoo&quot;), in the list of unclean birds. The Latin term by which we designate the bird is very similar to the Arabic, and all names for it in different countries are so nearly the same that they prove themselves based on its double cry, &quot;cuck-oo,&quot; or the single note &quot;kowk&quot; or &quot;gouk.&quot; The bird is as old as history, and interesting because the European species placed its eggs in the nests of other birds, which gave rise to much fiction concerning its habits. The European bird is a brownish gray with white bars underneath, and larger than ours, which are a beautiful olive gray, with tail feathers of irregular length touched with white, knee tufts, black or yellow bill, according to species, and beautiful sleek head and shining eyes. Our birds build their own nests, attend their young with care and are much loved for their beauty. Their food is not repulsive in any species; there never was any reason why they should have been classed among the abominations, and for these reasons scientists in search of a &quot;lean, slender&quot; bird of offensive diet and habit have selected the &quot;sea-mew&quot; (which see) which is substituted for cuckoo in the Revised Version (British and American) with good natural-history reason to sustain the change.Gene Stratton-Porter</p>

Cucumbers are great favorites with all the people of Palestine. Two varieties occur, Cucumis sativus (Arabic, Khyar), originally a product of Northwest India, which is smooth-skinned, whitish and of delicate flavor, and requires much water in its cultivation, and Cucumis chate (Arabic, faqqus), which is long and slender but less juicy than the former. Probably the Biblical reference is to this latter as it is a plant much grown in Egypt where it is said to attain unusual excellence.A &quot;garden of cucumbers&quot; or more literally a &quot;place of cucumbers&quot; (miqshdh), is mentioned in Isa 1:8; Baruch 6:70. &quot;A lodge in a garden of cucumbers&quot; (Isa 1:8) is the rough wooden booth erected by the owner from which he keeps guard over his ripening vegetables. It is commonly raised upon poles and, when abandoned for the season, it falls into decay and presents a dreary spectacle of tottering poles and dead leaves.E. W. G. Masterman</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(Most frequently, koc; four other words in one passage each; poterion): A vessel for drinking from, of a variety of material (gold, silver, earthenware), patterns (Es 1:7) and elaboration.Figurative: By ordinary figure of speech, put sometimes for the contents of the cup, namely, for that which is drunk (Mt 26:39). In both Old Testament and New Testament applied figuratively to that which is portioned out, and of which one is to partake; most frequently used of what is sorrowful, as God&#x27;s judgments, His wrath, afflictions, etc. (Ps 11:6; 75:8; Isa 51:17; Re 14:10). In a similar sense, used by Christ concerning the sufferings endured by Him (Mt 26:39), and the calamities attending the confession of His name (Mt 20:23). In the Old Testament applied also to the blessedness and joy of the children of God, and the full provision made for their wants (Ps 16:5; 23:5; 116:13; compare Jer 16:7; Pr 31:6). All these passages refer not only to the experience of an allotted joy and sorrow, but to the fact that all others share in this experience. Within a community of those having the same interests or lot, each received his apportioned measure, just as at a feast, each cup is filled for the individual to drain at the same time that his fellow-guests are occupied in the same way.The Holy Supper is called &quot;the cup of the Lord&quot; (1Co 10:21), since it is the Lord who makes the feast, and tenders the cup, just as &quot;the cup of demons&quot; with which it is contrasted, refers to what they offer and communicate. In 1Co 11:25, the cup is called &quot;the new covenant in my blood,&quot; i.e. it is a pledge and seal and means of imparting the blessings of the new covenant (Heb 10:16 f)--a covenant established by the shedding of the blood of Christ. The use of the word &quot;cup&quot; for the sacrament shows how prominent was the part which the cup had in the Lord&#x27;s Supper in apostolic times. Not only were all commanded to drink of the wine (Mt 26:27), but the very irregularities in the Corinthian church point to its universal use (1Co 11:27). Nor does the Roman church attempt to justify its withholding the cup from the laity (the communion in one form) upon conformity with apostolic practice, or upon direct Scriptural authority. This variation from the original institution is an outgrowth of the doctrines of transubstantiation and sacramental concomitance, of the attempt to transform the sacrament of the Eucharist into the sacrifice of the Mass, and of the wide separation between clergy and laity resulting from raising the ministry to the rank of a sacerdotal order. The practice was condemned by Popes Leo I (died 461) and Gelasius (died 496); but gained a firm hold in the 12th century, and was enacted into a church regulation by the Council of Constance in 1415.See also BLESSING, CUP OF.As to the use of cups for divination (Ge 44:5), the reference is to superstitious practice derived from the Gentiles.

On account of the constant fear of plots and intrigues, a person must be regarded as thoroughly trustworthy to hold this position. He must guard against poison in the king&#x27;s cup, and was sometimes required to swallow some of the wine before serving it. His confidential relations with the king often endeared him to his sovereign and also gave him a position of great influence. This officer is first mentioned in Scripture in Ge 40:1 ff, where the Hebrew word elsewhere translated &quot;cupbearer&quot; is rendered &quot;butler.&quot; The phrase &quot;chief of the butlers&quot; (Ge 40:2) accords with the fact that there were often a number of such officials under one as chief (compare Xen. Hellen. vii.1, 38). Nehemiah (compare Ne 1:11) was cupbearer to Artaxerxes Longimanus, and was held in high esteem by him, as the record shows. His financial ability (Ne 5:8,10,14,17) would indicate that the office was a lucrative one. Cupbearers are mentioned further in 1Ki 10:5; 2Ch 9:4, where they, among other evidences of royal splendor, are stated to have impressed the queen of Sheba with Solomon&#x27;s glory. The title Rabshakeh (Isa 36:2), once thought to mean &quot;chief of the cupbearers,&quot; is now given a different derivation and explained as &quot;chief of the officers,&quot; or &quot;princes&quot; (BDB under the word).

It is often used in contrast with &quot;bless&quot; or &quot;blessing&quot; (De 11:29). When a curse is pronounced against any person, we are not to understand this as a mere wish, however violent, that disaster should overtake the person in question, any more than we are to understand that a corresponding &quot;blessing&quot; conveys simply a wish that prosperity should be the lot of the person on whom the blessing is invoked. A curse was considered to possess an inherent power of carrying itself into effect. Prayer has been defined as a wish referred to God. Curses (or blessings) were imprecations referred to supernatural beings in whose existence and power to do good or inflict harm primitive man believed. The use of magic and spells of all kinds is based on the belief that it is possible to enlist the support of the superhuman beings with whom the universe abounds, and to persuade them to carry out the suppliant&#x27;s wishes. It has been suggested that spells were written on pieces of parchment and cast to the winds in the belief that they would find their way to their proper destination--that some demoniac being would act as postman and deliver them at the proper address. In Zec 5:1-3 the &quot;flying roll,&quot; with curses inscribed on it &quot;goeth forth over the face of the whole land.&quot; It would find its way into the house of every thief and perjurer. But it was not always possible to commit curses to writing, it was enough to utter them aloud. Generally the name of some deity would be coupled with such imprecations, as Goliath cursed David by his gods (1Sa 17:43). Such curses once uttered possessed the power of self- realization. It was customary for heads of families in their declining years to bless their children, such a blessing being, not simply a paternal wish that their children should prosper in life, but a potent factor in determining their welfare (Ge 9:25). in this case Jacob seeks his father&#x27;s blessing, which was more than his father&#x27;s good wishes for his future career. Such blessings and curses were independent of moraI considerations. Before moral distinctions played any part in molding theological conceptions it was not necessary, before a spell could be effectual, that the individual against whom the spell was pronounced should be deserving, on moral grounds, of the fate which was invoked on him. It was sufficient that he should be the foe of the author of the curse. We may assume that such curses signalized the commencement of a battle. But in process of time such indiscriminate imprecations would not satisfy enlightened moral judgment. In the dramatic situation depicted in De 11:29; 27:12 f the curse was placed on Mt. Ebal and the blessing. on Mr. Gerizim. But the curse was the penalty for disobedience, as the blessi...</p>

The Ancestor of Many Nations:(1) The first of the sons of Ham, from whom sprang Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah and Sabtecah. He was also the father of Nimrod, who rounded Babel (Babylon) and the other great states of Shinar or Babylonia (Ge 10:6-8). The meaning of the name is uncertain.(2) The name of the country around which the Gihon flowed (Ge 2:13), rendered &quot;Ethiopia&quot; in the King James Version, but in view of the distance of that country from the other rivers mentioned, this seems to be an unlikely identification.2. A District of the Garden of Eden:Fried. Delitzsch has suggested (Wo lag das Paradies? 74 ff) that the watercourse in question is the canal Gu-hande or Arahtu, which, coming from the South, entered Babylon a little to the East of the Euphrates, and, flowing alongside the Festival-Street, entered the Euphrates to the North of Nebuchadrezzar&#x27;s palace. Koldewey (Tempel von Babylon und Borsippa, 38) regards the Gu-hande as the section of the Euphrates itself at this point. There is no indication, however, that the district which it enclosed was ever called Kusu or Cush, and the suppression of the final syllable of Gu-hande would remain unexplained. Moreover, the identification of Cush with a possible Cas, for Kasdu, &quot;Chaldea,&quot; seems likewise improbable, especially as that name could only have been applied, in early times, to the district bordering on the Persian Gulf (see CHALDEA).3. Probably not in Asia Minor:Another theory is, that the Cush of Ge 2:13 is the Kusu of certain Assyrian letters, where it seems to designate a district in the neighborhood of Cappadocia. This identification apparently leads us back to an ancient tradition at one time current in the East, but later forgotten, which caused the Pyramus river to assume the name of Jihun (i.e. Gihon). This stream rises in the mountains Northeast of the Gulf of Alexandretta, and, taking a southwesterly course, flows into the Mediterranean near Karatash. Though nearer than the Ethiopian Cush, this is still too far West, and therefore unsatisfactory as an identification--all the streams or waterways of the Garden of Eden ought to flow through the same district.4. The Ethiopian Cush:(3) The well-known country of Cush or Ethiopia, from Syene (Eze 29:10) southward--Egyptian Kos, Babylonian Kusu, Assyrian Kusu. This name sometimes denotes the land (Isa 11:11; 18:1; Ze 3:10; Eze 29:10; Job 28:19; Es 1:1; 8:9); sometimes the peopl (Isa 20:4; Jer 46:9; Eze 38:5); but is in many passages uncertain. Notwithstanding that the descendants of Ham are always regarded as non-Semites, the Ethiopians, Ge`ez, as they called themselves, spoke a Semitic language of special interest on account of its likeness to Himyaritic, and its illustration of certain forms in Assyro-Babylonian. These Cushites were in all probability migrants from another (more northerly) district, and akin to the Canaanites--like them, dark, but by no means black, and certainly not Negroes. W.

After Joshua&#x27;s death the children of Israel soon began to affiliate themselves with the heathen peoples among whom they dwelt. This was the fertile source of all their troubles.

With the article (so in 2Sa 18:21-32 seven out of eight times, all readings supported by the Septuagint) it simply indicate that the person so designated was of the Cushite people, as in Jer 38:7 ff. Its use without the article has doubtless developed out of the foregoing according to a familiar process. For the Cush of Ps 7, title read &quot;Cushi&quot; with Septuagint.(1) The messenger (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;the Cushite&quot;) sent by Joab to acquaint David with the victory over Absalom. That this man was in fact a foreigner is indicated by his ignorance of a shorter path which Ahimaaz took, by his being unrecognized by the watchman who recognizes Ahimaaz, and by his ignorance, as compared with Ahimaaz, of the sentiments of David, whom he knows only as a king and not as a man. 2Sa 18:21 (twice, the second time without the article), 2Sa 18:22,23,11 (twice), 2Sa 18:32 (twice).(2) The great-grandfather of Jehudi, a contemporary of Jeremiah (Jer 36:14). The name Jehudi itself (&quot;a man of Judah&quot;) is sufficient refutation of the opinion that the use of Cushi as or in lieu of a proper name &quot;seems to show that there were but few Cushites among the Israelites.&quot;(3) The father of Zephaniah the prophet (Ze 1:1).J.

Views regarding this person have been of two general classes:(1) She is to be identified with Zipporah (Ex 2:21 and elsewhere), Moses&#x27; Midianite wife, who is here called &quot;the Gushite,&quot; either in scorn of her dark complexion (compare Jer 13:23) and foreign origin (so most older exegetes), or as a consequence of an erroneous notion of the late age when this apocryphal addition, &quot;because of the Cushite,&quot; etc., was inserted in the narrative (so Wellhansen).(2) She is a woman whom Moses took to wife after the death of Zipporah, really a Cushite (Ethiopian) by race, whether the princess of Meroe of whom Josephus (Ant., II, x, 2) romances (so Targum of Jonathan), or one of the &quot;mixed multitude&quot; (Ex 12:38; compare Nu 11:4) that accompanied the Hebrews on their wanderings (so Ewald and most). Dillmann suggests a compromise between the two classes of views, namely, that this woman is a mere &quot;variation in the saga&quot; from the wife elsewhere represented as Midianite, yet because of this variation she was understood by the author as distinct from Zipporah. The implication of the passage, in any case, is clearly that this connection of Moses tended to injure his prestige in the eyes of race-proud Hebrews, and, equally, that in the author&#x27;s opinion such a view of the matter was obnoxious to God.J.

As &quot;cut off&quot; it is used in the sense of laying or destroying (Ge 9:11; De 12:29; 1Ki 11:16; Ps 101:8, etc.), also for cutting off transgressors from the community of Yahweh, which meant probably separation, or exclusion, rather than death or destruction (Ge 17:14; Ex 12:15,19). Other words are damam, (&quot;to be silent,&quot; &quot;cease&quot; Jer 25:37 the King James Version; Jer 48:2); tsamath &quot;to destroy&quot; (Ps 54:5 the King James Version; Ps 94:23, etc.); gadhadh, &quot;to cut, one&#x27;s self,&quot; is used of the cutting of one&#x27;s flesh before heathen gods and in mourning for the dead, which was forbidden to the Israelites, (De 14:1; 1Ki 18:28; Jer 16:6; 41:5; 47:5); sereT, sareTeth, &quot;incision,&quot; are also used of those &quot;cuttings of the flesh&quot; (Le 19:28; compare Le 21:5). See CUTTINGS IN THE FLESH. The cutting of the hair of head and beard in mourning for the dead is referred to in Isa 15:2; &quot;Every, beard is cut off&quot; (gadha`), and Jer 7:29, gazaz, &quot;Cut off thy hair&quot; (the Revised Version, margin &quot;thy crown&quot;), O Jerusalem (compare Isa 22:12; Jer 16:6; Eze 7:18; Am 8:10).

Probably in consequence of their predominating numbers, the inhabitants of Samaria in general were then called kuthiyim, or Cutbeans.  1. The Ruins of Cuthah:From contract-tablets found at Tel-Ibrahim by the late Hormuzd Hassam, on which the ancient name of the place is given as Gudua or Kutu, it would seem that that is the site which has to be identified with the Biblical Cuthah. It lies to the Northeast of Babylon, and was one of the most important cities of the Babylonian empire. The explorer describes the ruins as being about 3,000 ft. in circumference and 280 ft. high, and adjoining them on the West lies a smaller mound, crowned with a sanctuary dedicated to Ibrahim (Abraham). From the nature of the ruins, Rassam came to the conclusion that the city was much more densely populated after the fall of Babylon than in earlier times. A portion of the ruins were in a very perfect state, and suggested an unfinished building.2. The Temple:The great temple of the city was called E-mes-lam, and was dedicated to Nergal (compare 2Ki 17:30), one of whose names was Meslam-ta-ea. Both city and temple would seem to have been old Sumerian foundations, as the name Gudua and its later Sere form, Kutu, imply.LITERATURE.See Rassam, Asshur and the Land of Nimrod, 396, 409, and, for details of the worship of Nergal, PSBA, December, 1906, 203-18.T.

The fact is abundantly attested for most of the nations of antiquity, but there are two notable exceptions, the Egyptians (Herod. ii.61, 85; Wilkinson, Anc. Egyptian II, 374), and the Hebrews (De 14:1; Le 21:5). According to Plutarch (Sol. 21) Solon forbade the women of Athens to beat themselves to the effusion of blood, and the laws of the Twelve Tables, quoted by Cic. (De leg. ii.23) contained a like injunction. Among the ancient Arabs the forbidden practice was associated, as among the Hebrews, with the cutting off of the hair (Wellhausen, Skizzen, III, 160 f).That the prohibition among the Hebrews was urgently called for is made clear by the way it is dealt with by the Law and the prophets. The Law of Holiness reads: &quot;Ye are the children of Yahweh your God: ye shall not cut yourselves&quot; (De 14:1), or &quot;make any incision&quot; (sereT; Le 19:28, sareTeth; Septuagint entomis) in the flesh &quot;for the dead.&quot; Probably the earliest reference to the custom as actually prevalent among the Hebrews is in Ho 7:14 (ERVm). It was widely prevalent in the time of Jeremiah among his countrymen, even as among the Philistines (Jer 47:5) and the Moabites (Jer 48:37; compare Am 8:10; Isa 3:24; 15:2; 22:12; Mic 1:16; Eze 7:18).In seeking for the reason or purpose underlying all such prohibitions, we may note, first, that the &quot;cuttings&quot; and &quot;baldness&quot; forbidden are alike said to be &quot;for the dead.&quot; Not less explicitly are they said to be incompatible with Israel&#x27;s unique relation to Yahweh--a relation at once of sonship (De 14:1) and of consecration (De 14:2). Moreover such mutilations of the body are always dealt with as forming part of the religious rites of the heathen (as of the Canaanitish Baal (1Ki 18:28) note &quot;after their manner,&quot; see article in HDB, under the word). Both such shedding of blood and the dedication of the hair are found in almost all countries of that day in intimate connection with the rituals of burial and the prevailing belief in the necessity of propitiating the spirit of the deceased. The conclusion, then, seems clearly warranted that such tokens of grief were prohibited because they carried with them inevitably ideas and associations distinctly heathen in character and so incompatible with the pure religion of Yahweh, and unworthy of those who had attained to the dignity of the sons (&quot;children&quot;) of Yahweh.See also STIGMATA, MARK;LITERATURE.Benzinger, Heb Arch., section 23; Nowack, Heb Arch., I, 33 f; Tylor, Prim.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">si&#x27;-prus (Kupros):1. Name:An island situated near the Northeast corner of the Levant, in an angle formed by the coasts of Cilicia and Syria. In the Old Testament it is called Kittim, after the name of its Phoenician capital Kition. The identification is expressly made by Josephus (Ant., I, vi, 1) and by the Cyprian bishop Epiphanius (Haer., xxx.25). In the tablets from Tell el- Amarna it is referred to as Alashia (E. Meyer, Gesch. des Alterthums, 12, section 499), in Egyptian records as Asi, while in the Assyrian cuneiform inscriptions it is named Yavnan.2. Geography:The island is the largest in the Mediterranean with the exception of Sardinia and Sicily, its area being about 3,584 square miles. It lies in 34 degrees 30&#x27;-35 degrees 41&#x27; North latitude and 32 degrees 15&#x27;-34 degrees 36&#x27; East longitude, only 46 miles distant from the nearest point of the Cilician coast and 60 miles from the Syrian. Thus from the northern shore of the island the mainland of Asia Minor is clearly visible and Mt. Lebanon can be seen from Eastern Cyprus. This close proximity to the Cilician and Syrian coasts, as well as its position on the route between Asia Minor and Egypt, proved of great importance for the history and civilization of the island. Its greatest length, including the Northeast promontory, is about 140 miles, its greatest breadth 60 miles. The Southwest portion of Cyprus is formed by a mountain complex, culminating in the peaks of Troodos (6,406 ft.), Madhari (5,305 ft.), Papofitsa (5,124 ft.) and Machaira (4,674 ft.). To the Northeast of this lies the great plain of the Mesorea, nearly 60 miles in length and 10 to 20 in breadth, in which lies the modern capital Nicosia (Lefkosia). It is watered chiefly by the Pediaeus (modern Pedias), and is bounded on the North by a mountain range, which is continued to the East-Northeast in the long, narrow promontory of the Karpass, terminating in Cape Andrea, the ancient Dinaretum. Its highest peaks are Buffavento (3,135 ft.) and Hagios Elias (3,106 ft.). The shore-plain to the North of these hills is narrow, but remarkably fertile.3. Products:Cyprus is richly endowed by nature. Its fruits and flowers were famous in antiquity. Strabo, writing under Augustus, speaks of it as producing wine and oil in abundance and corn sufficient for the needs of its inhabitants (XIV, 684). The elder Pliny refers to Cyprian salt, alum, gypsum, mica, unguents, laudanum, storax, resin and precious stones, including agate, jasper, amethyst, lapis lazuli and several species of rock-crystal. His list includes the diamond (xxxvii.58) and the emerald (xxxvii.6, 66), but there is reason to believe that under these names a variety of rock-crystal and the beryl are intended. The chief source of the island&#x27;s wealth, however, lay in its mines and forests. Silver is mentioned by Strabo (loc. cit.) among its products; copper, which was called by the Greeks after the name of the island, was extensively mined there from the earliest period down to the...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">si-re&#x27;-ne (Kurene &quot;wall&quot;):1. Location:Cyrene was a city of Libya in North Africa, lat. 32 degrees 40&#x27; North, long. 22 degrees 15&#x27; East. It lay West of ancient Egypt, from which it was separated by a portion of the Libyan desert, and occupied the territory now belonging to Barca and Tripoli. It was situated upon an elevated plateau about 2,000 ft. above the sea, from which it was distant some 10 miles. A high range of mountains lies to the South, about 90 miles inland. This shelters the coast land from the scorching heat of the Sahara. The range drops down toward the North in a series of terrace-like elevations, thus giving to the region a great variety of climate and vegetation. The soil is fertile.2. History:Cyrene was originally a Greek colony rounded by Battus in 630 BC. Because of the fertility of the soil, the great variety in climate and vegetation, together with its commercial advantages in location, the city soon rose to great wealth and importance. Greater fame, however, came to it through its distinguished citizens. It was the home of Callimachus the poet, Carneacles the founder of the New Academy at Athens, and Eratosthenes the mathematician. To these must be added, from later times, the elegant ancient Christian writer Synesius. So important did this Greek colony become that, in little more than half a century, Amasis II of Egypt formed an alliance with Cyrene, marrying a Greek lady of noble, perhaps royal, birth (Herod. ii.181). Ptolemy III (Euergetes I), 231 BC, incorporated Cyrene with Egypt. The city continued, though with much restlessness, a part of the Egyptian empire until Apion, the last of the Ptolemies, willed it to Rome. It henceforth belonged to a Roman province.In the middle of the 7th century, the conquering Saracens took possession of Cyrene, and from that time to this it has been the habitation of wandering tribes of Arabs.3. Biblical Importance:Cyrene comes into importance in Biblical history through the dispersion of the Jews. Ptolemy I, son of Lagus, transported Jews to this and other cities of Libya (Josephus, CAp, II, 4) and from this time on Jews were very numerous there. By the return of the Jews of the Dispersion to the feasts at Jerusalem, Cyrenians came to have a conspicuous place in the New Testament history. &quot;A man of Cyrene, Simon by name,&quot; was caught by the Roman soldiers and compelled to bear the cross of Jesus (Mt 27:32; compare Mr 15:21; Lu 23:26). See CYRENIAN. Jews from Cyrene were among those present on the day of Pentecost. Their city appears as one of the important points in the wide circle of the Dispersion described by Peter in his sermon on that occasion (Ac 2:10). Cyrenian Jews were of sufficient importance in those days to have their name associated with a synagogue at Jerusalem (Ac 6:9). And when the persecution arose about Stephen, some of these Jews of Cyrene who had been converted at Jerusalem, were scattered abroad and came with others to Antioch and preached the word &quot;unto the Jews onl...</p>

Cyrus and the Jews18. Cyrus in Persia--His Bas-relief1. Genealogy of Cyrus:The son of the earlier Cambyses, of the royal race of the Achemenians. His genealogy, as given by himself, is as follows: &quot;I am Cyrus, king of the host, the great king, the mighty king, king of Tindir (Babylon), king of the land of Sumeru and Akkadu, king of the four regions, son of Cambyses, the great king, king of the city Ansan, grandson of Cyrus, the great king, king of the city Ansan, great-grandson of Sispis (Teispes), the great king, king of the city Ansan, the all-enduring royal seed whose sovereignty Bel and Nebo love,&quot; etc. (WAI, V, plural 35, 20-22).2. His Country, Ansan or Anzan:As, in the Babylonian inscriptions, Assan (Ansan, Anzan) is explained as Elam--the city was, in fact, the capital of that country--it is probable that Cyrus&#x27; name was Elamite; but the meaning is doubtful. The Greek etymology connecting it with khor, &quot;the sun&quot; in Persian, may therefore be rejected. According to Strabo, he was at first called Agradates, the name by which he was universally known being taken from that of the river Cyrus. This, however, is more likely to have been the reason why his grandfather (after whom he was probably named) was called Cyrus.3. His Origin (Herodotus):Several versions of his birth and rise to power are recorded. Herodotus (i.95) mentions three. In that which he quotes (i.107 ff), it is said that Mandane was the daughter of the Median king Astyages, who, in consequence of a dream which he had had, foretelling the ultimate triumph of her son over his dynasty, gave her in marriage to a Persian named Cambyses, who was not one of his peers. A second dream caused him to watch for her expected offspring, and when Cyrus came into the world Astyages delivered the child to his relative, Harpagus, with orders to destroy it. Being Unwilling to do this, he handed the infant to a Shepherd named Mitradates, who, his wife having brought forth a still-born child, consented to spare the life of the infant Cyrus. Later on, in consequence of his imperious acts, Cyrus was recognized by Astyages, who came to learn the whole story, and spared him because, having once been made king by his companions in play, the Magians held the predictions concerning his ultimate royal state to have been fulfilled. The vengeance taken by Astyages upon Harpagus for his apparent disobedience to o...</p>
