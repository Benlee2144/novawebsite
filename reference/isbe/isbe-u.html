          <h3>UCAL</h3>
          <p>u&#x27;-kal (&#x27;ukhal (see below)): This name occurs along with that of Ithiel (Pr 30:1), both being taken by older interpreters as those of ancient sages. Some have suggested (see Toy, Proverbs, 519 f) that Ucal might be the &quot;Caleol&quot; of 1Ki 4:31 (Hebrew 5:11). Ucal was also explained as &quot;I can,&quot; i.e. &quot;I can maintain my obedience to God,&quot; just as Ithiel was taken to be &quot;signs of God.&quot; Septuagint, Aquila, Theodotion do not take the words as proper names, and so BDB with others point this word as a vb., &quot;(and) I am consumed&quot; (wa&#x27;ekhel, for [~we&#x27;ukhal). The last three words of the verse are then translated &quot;I have wearied myself, O God, I have wearied myself, O God, and am consumed.&quot;See ITHIEL.David Francis Roberts</p>

          <h3>ULAI</h3>
          <p>u&#x27;-li, u&#x27;-lai (&#x27;ubhal &#x27;ulay, &quot;river Ulai&quot;; Theodotion Da 8:2, Oubal, the Septuagint and Theodotion in 8:16, Oulai Latin, Eulaeus):1. The Name and Its Forms:A river which, running through the province of Elam, flowed through Shushan or Susa. It was from &quot;between&quot; this river that Daniel (8:16) heard a voice, coming apparently from the waters which flowed between its two banks.2. Present Names and Course:Notwithstanding that the rivers of Elam have often changed their courses, there is but little doubt that the Ulai is the Kerkhah, which, rising in the Persian plain near Nehavend (there called the Gamas-ab), is even there a great river. Turned by the mountains, it runs Northwest as far as Bisutun, receiving all the waters of Southern Kurdistan, where, as the Sein Merre, it passes through the inaccessible defiles of Luristan, its course before reaching the Kebir-Kuh being a succession of rapids. Turned aside by this mountain, it follows for about 95 miles the depression which here exists as far as the foothills of Luristan, reaching the Susian plain as a torrent; but it becomes less rapid before losing itself in the marshes of Hawizeh. The course of the stream is said to be still doubtful in places.3. Changed Bed at Susa:In ancient times it flowed at the foot of the citadel of Susa, but its bed is now about 1 1/4 miles to the West. The date of this change of course (during which a portion of the ruins of Susa was carried away) is uncertain, but it must have been later than the time of Alexander the Great. The stream&#x27;s greatest volume follows the melting of the snows in the mountains, and floods ensue if this coincides with the advent of heavy rain. Most to be dreaded are the rare occasions when it unites with the Ab-e-Diz.4. Assyrian References:The Ulai (Assyrian Ulaa or Ulaia) near Susa is regarded as being shown on the sculptures of the Assyrian king Ashur-bani-pal (British Museum, Nineveh Gal.) illustrating his campaign against Te-umman. Its rapid stream bears away the bodies of men and horses, with chariots, bows and quivers. The bodies which were thrown into the stream hindered its course, and dyed its waters with their blood.LITERATURESee Delegation en Perse: Memoires, I, Recherches Archeologiques, 25 ff.T. G.

          <h3>UNBELIEF</h3>
          <p>un-be-lef&#x27;: The word (the King James Version) represents two Greek words, apeitheia, &quot;disobedience&quot; (only in Ro 11:30,32; Heb 4:6,11), and apistia, &quot;distrust,&quot; the antithesis to &quot;faith&quot;. (which see). The two words are not only akin etymologically but run into one another by mental connection, certainly where spiritual relations are concerned, as between man and God. For when God has spoken, in precept and yet more in promise, distrust involves, at least potentially, an element of disobedience. His supreme claim is to be trusted to command only what is right, and to promise only what is true. He is infinitely sympathetic in His insight, and infallibly knows where distrust comes only of the dim perceptions and weak mis-givings of our mortal nature, and where, on the other hand, a moral resistance lies at the back of the non-confidence. But the presence of that darker element is always to be suspected, at least, and searched for in serious self-examination.We may remark that it is a loss in our language that &quot;unbelief&quot; is the only word we can use as the antithesis to &quot;faith&quot;; for &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;belief&quot; (which see) are not exactly synonyms. &quot;Unfaith&quot; would be a welcome word for such use, if it were generally so understood.Handley Dunelm</p>

          <p>un-be-lev&#x27;-er: This word follows closely the lines of &quot;unbelief&quot; (which see) in its relation to originals. Once only (Ac 14:2) it represents the participle apeithountes, &quot;disobeying (ones).&quot; Elsewhere (nine cases) it represents apistos, &quot;faithless,&quot; &quot;without faith.&quot; In six of these passages (all in 1 and 2 Corinthians) it denotes the unconverted pagan as distinguished from the convert. In the other passages (Lu 12:46; Tit 1:15; Re 21:8) the reference is to the unbelief which comes of moral resistance to God.</p>

          <p>un-chanj&#x27;-a-bl, un-chanj&#x27;-a-bl-nes:I. UNCHANGEABLENESS OF GOD A TRUTH OF NATURAL THEOLOGYII. SCRIPTURAL DOCTRINE OF THE UNCHANGEABLENESS OF GOD1. Not Lifeless Immobility2. As Contrasted with the Finite3. God&#x27;s Knowledge, Will and Purpose4. In His Relation to the World5. His Relations to MenLITERATUREThe unchangeablehess or immutability of God is that divine attribute which expresses the truth that in His nature and perfections, in His knowledge, will and purpose, He always remains the same in the fullness of His infinite and perfect Being; infinitely exalted above change, becoming and development, which are the specific characteristics of all finite existence. This is one of what theologians have called the incommunicable attributes of God, that is, one of those specific characteristics of the divine nature which make God to be God in distinction from all that is finite. These attributes have also been called negative attributes. By calling them negative, however, it is not meant that they express the nature of God in so far as He is unknowable and incomprehensible by the finite mind, while the positive attributes, such as love and righteousness, express God&#x27;s nature as revealed and known. Both kinds of attributes can be known only in so far as God reveals Himself, and furthermore the so-called negative attributes involve a positive idea, while the positive ones in turn imply the negation of all finite limitations. Moreover, since the finite mind cannot comprehend the infinite God, back of all that God has revealed of Himself, back even of His absoluteness, eternity and unchangeability, lies the fullness of His infinite Being, unsearchable, unknowable, and incomprehensible alike in His nature and attributes (Ps 145:3; 147:5; Job 11:7-9; Isa 40:28).It is these incommunicable attributes, including unchangeableness, which make God to be God, and mark the specific difference between Him and all finite existence. Unchangeableness is, therefore, the characteristic of God&#x27;s entire nature and of all His attributes. It cannot be limited to His ethical nature or to His love, and, while it is true that these incommunicable attributes are revealed with especial richness in God&#x27;s saving activity, they cannot be limited to marks of God&#x27;s saving action or purpose. It is true that God is unchangeable in His love and grace and power to save, but that is only because it is the love and grace and power of the absolute, infinite and immutable God.I. Unchangeableness of God a Truth of Natural Theology.As the One infinitely perfect and absolute or self-existent Being, God is exalted far above the possibility of change, because He is independent, self-existent and unlimited by all the causes of change. As uncaused and self-existent, God cannot be changed from without; as infinitely perfect, He cannot suffer change from within; and as eternal and independent of time, which is the &quot;form&quot; of change and mutability, He cannot be subject to any change at all.

          <p>un-sur&#x27;-kum-sizd, un-sur-kum-sizh&#x27;-un: The adjective in the Old Testament is `arel (Ge 17:14, etc.), from a root of uncertain meaning, with the noun `orlah, &quot;uncircumcised (person)&quot; (Le 19:23; Jer 9:25), and the verb `aral, &quot;count as uncircumcised&quot; (Le 19:23; the Revised Version (British and American) Hab 2:16). In the Apocrypha and the New Testament the noun is akrobustia (a physiological term, 1 Macc 1:15; Ac 11:3, etc.), and the adjective aperitmetos (Additions to Esther 14:15; 1 Macc 1:48; 2:46; Ac 7:51), with the verb epispaomai, &quot;become uncircumcised&quot; (1Co 7:18). The language of 1 Macc 1:15 suggests the performance of some surgical operation, but no such operation appears to be possible, and &quot;behaved like uncircumcised persons&quot; (as in 1Co 7:18) is the probable meaning.See CIRCUMCISION.Burton Scott Easton</p>

In the Old Testament (Hebrew):Tum&#x27;ah, &quot;uncleanness,&quot; &quot;defilement,&quot; occurs 26 times (Le 7:20,21; 14:19; 15:3,15,26,30,31, etc.). niddah, &quot;separation,&quot; &quot;impurity,&quot; occurs in Le 20:21; Ezr 9:11; Zec 13:1. &#x27;erwah, occurs in De 23:14. &#x27;erwath dabhar, &quot;unclean thing&quot; (De 24:1) is translated &quot;uncleanness&quot; in the King James Version. The adjective Tame&#x27;, &quot;defiled,&quot; &quot;unclean,&quot; occurs 72 times (over half in Leviticus), but is never translated &quot;uncleanness,&quot; but always &quot;unclean.&quot; The verb Tame&#x27;, &quot;to make&quot; or &quot;declare unclean,&quot; occurs often. Other Hebrew verbs &quot;to defile&quot; are ga&#x27;al, chalal, chaneph, Tanaph, `alal, `anah.2. In the New Testament:The Greek word for &quot;uncleanness&quot; is akatharsia, which occurs 10 times (Mt 23:27; Ro 1:24; 6:19; 2Co 12:21, etc.). miasmos, &quot;pollution,&quot; occurs only in 2Pe 2:10. The adjective akathartos, &quot;unclean,&quot; occurs 31 times, 23 times in reference to unclean spirits (Luke once using the expression &quot;unclean demon,&quot; 4:33), 4 times to ceremonial uncleanness (thee by Peter and one by John the revelator), and 4 times to moral uncleanness (three by Paul and one by John the revelator). Koinos, &quot;common,&quot; &quot;unclean,&quot; occurs 8 times in the sense of &quot;unclean&quot; (Mr 7:2,5; Ac 10:14,28; 11:8; Ro 14:14; Re 21:27). The verb koinoo, &quot;to defile,&quot; occurs 11 times (Mt 15:11,18,20; Mr 7:15, etc.). miaino, &quot;to defile,&quot; occurs 5 times (Joh 18:28; Tit 1:15; Heb 12:15; Jude 1:8). moluno, &quot;to make filthy,&quot; occurs 3 times (1Co 8:7; Re 3:4; 14:4). spiloo, occurs twice (Jas 3:6; Jude 1:23) and phtheiro, &quot;to corrupt,&quot; occurs 7 times in Greek, once in English Versions of the Bible (1Co 3:17).3. In the Septuagint:Akatharsia, &quot;uncleanness,&quot; occurs 59 times in Septuagint (including many instances in apocryphal books) (1 and 2 Esdras, Tobit, 1 and 2 Maccabees, etc.). Akathartos, &quot;unclean,&quot; occurs 134 times in the Septuagint (including one example in 1 Maccabees). Koinos, &quot;unclean,&quot; and koinoo, &quot;to make unclean,&quot; occur in Esther, Proverbs, Wisdom, 1, 2, 3 and 4 Maccabees). Miaino, &quot;to defile,&quot; occurs over 100 times.

Possible Relation of Israel&#x27;s Laws on Uncleanness with the Laws of Taboo among the Nations:W. R. Smith (Lectures on the Religion of the Semites, 152-55) thinks there is a kinship between Israel&#x27;s laws of uncleanness and the heathen taboo. Frazer, in The Golden Bough, shows numerous examples of the taboo among various tribes and nations which present striking similarity to some of Israel&#x27;s laws on uncleanness. But does this diminish our respect for the Old Testament laws on uncleanness? Might not Yahweh use this natural religious perception of men as to an intri...</p>

          <h3>UNKNOWN GOD</h3>
          <p>un-non&#x27;, (agnostos theos): In Ac 17:23 (St. Paul&#x27;s speech in Athens) the American Standard Revised Version reads: &quot;I found also an altar with this inscription, To AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore ye worship in ignorance, this I set forth unto you.&quot; the King James Version and the English Revised Version margin translate &quot;to the Unknown God,&quot; owing to the fact that in Greek certain words, of which theos is one, may drop the article when it is to be understood. In the present case the use of the article. is probably right (compare Ac 17:24). In addition, the King James Version reads &quot;whom&quot; and &quot;him&quot; in place of &quot;what&quot; and &quot;this.&quot; The difference here is due to a variation in the Greek manuscripts, most of which support the King James Version. But internal probability is against the King James Version&#x27;s reading, as it would have been very easy for a scribe to change neuters (referring to the divine power) into masculines after &quot;God,&quot; but not vice versa. Hence, modern editors (except yon Soden&#x27;s margin) have adopted the reading in the Revised Version (British and American).Paul in Athens, &quot;as he beheld the city full of idols,&quot; felt that God was truly unknown there. Hence the altar with the inscription struck him as particularly significant. Some Athenians, at any rate, felt the religious inadequacy of all known deities and were appealing to the God who they felt must exist, although they knew nothing definite about Him. No better starting-point for an address could be wished. What the inscription actually meant, however, is another question. Nothing is known about it. Altars dedicated &quot;to unknown gods&quot; (in the plural) seem to have been fairly common (Jerome on Tit 1:12; Pausanias, i.1,4; Philaster, Vita Apoll., vi.3), and Blase (Commentary ad loc.) has even suggested that the words in Ac were originally in the plural. But this would spoil the whole point of the speech, and the absence of references to a single inscription among thousands that existed can cause no surprise. Those inscriptions in the plural seem to have been meant in the sense &quot;to the other deities that may exist in addition to those already known,&quot; but an inscription in the sing. could not have this meaning. Perhaps a votive inscription is meant, where the worshipper did not know which god to thank for some benefit received. That a slur on all the other Athenian objects of worship was intended is, however, most improbable, but Paul could not of course be expected to know the technical meaning of such inscriptions.See ATHENS.Buston Scott Easton</p>

The same idea lies in 9:48, &quot;The fire is not quenched&quot; (ou sbennutai), and is implied in the numerous allusions to fire as the instrument of punishment and destruction in the Gospels and other parts of the New Testament (e.g. &quot;the Gehenna of fire,&quot; Mt 5:22 margin, etc.; &quot;furnace of fire,&quot; Mt 13:40,42,50; &quot;eternal fire,&quot; Mt 25:41; compare also 2Th 1:8; 2Pe 3:7; Jude 1:7; Re 19:20; 20:10,14,15; 21:8). For Old Testament analogies compare Isa 1:31; 34:10; 66:24; Jer 4:4; 7:20; 17:27; 21:12; Eze 20:47,48. The language is obviously highly metaphorical, conveying the idea of an awful and abiding judgment, but is not to be pressed as teaching a destruction in the sense of annihilation of the wicked. An unquenchable fire is not needed for a momentary act of destruction. Even in the view of Edward White, the wicked survive the period of judgment to which these terms relate.See PUNISHMENT, EVERLASTING.James Orr</p>

In the interior of Palestine and Syria walls are still commonly built of small stones or mud bricks, and then smeared over with clay mortar. The surface is rubbed smooth and is attractive in appearance. This coating prolongs the life of the wall but requires yearly attention if the wall is to stand.Ezekiel uses the practice to typify the work of false prophets. They build up stories and make them plausible by an outward semblance to truth, while, in fact, they are flimsy, unreliable prophecies, resembling the walls described above, which can be broken down by a push or a heavy rain storm.James A.

Hence, the Pharisaic view that the hands became unclean (religiously, not physically), and so before meals must be cleansed (religiously) by washing, which consisted in two affusions and must extend up to the wrist, else the hand was still unclean. Jewish tradition traced this custom back to Solomon (see Shabbath 14b, end), but the first unmistakable occurrence of the custom is in the Sibylline Oracles (3:591-93), where the hands are said to be washed in connection with prayer and thanksgiving. The schools of Shammai and Hillel, though usually differing on points of tradition, agreed on the washing of hands as necessary for ceremonial purification (having reached this agreement in the early part of Jesus&#x27; life).See PURITY; UNCLEANNESS.LITERATURE.Broadus, Commentary on Matthew (15:2-20); Gould, Swete, commentaries on Mark (7:2); Edersheim, The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah, II, 8 ff; Schurer.

          <h3>UR OF THE CHALDEES</h3>
          <p>kal&#x27;-dez (&#x27;ur kasdim; he chora (ton) Chaldaion): For more than 2,000 years efforts have been made to identify the site of this city. The writers of the Septuagint, either being unfamiliar with the site, or not considering it a city, wrote chora, &quot;land,&quot; instead of Ur. Eupolemus, who lived about 150 BC, spoke of it as being a city of Babylonia called Camarina, which he said was called by some Ouria. Stephen (Ac 7:2,4) regarded the place as being in Mesopotamia. The Talmud, however, as well as some later Arabic writers, regarded Erech (the Septuagint Orek) as the city. The cuneiform writing of this city, Urnki, would seem to support this view, but Erech is mentioned in Genesis. Ammianus Marcellinus identified the city with the castle of Ur in the desert between Hatra and Nisibis, but this was only founded in the time of the Persians. Owing to its nearness to Haran, and because Stephen placed it in Mesopotamia, Urfa or Oorfa, named Edessa by the Greeks, has also in modern times been identified as the city. But Seleucus is credited with having built this city.The most generally-accepted theory at the present time is that Ur is to be identified with the modern Mugheir (or Mughayyar, &quot;the pitchy&quot;) in Southern Babylonia, called Urumma, or Urima, and later Uru in the inscriptions. This borders on the district which in the 1st millennium BC was called Chaldea (Kaldu).This, some hold, accords with the view of Eupolemus, because Camarina may be from the Arabic name of the moon qamar, which refers perhaps to the fact that the ancient city was dedicated to the worship of the moon-god. Another argument which has been advanced for this identification is that Haran, the city to which Terah migrated, was also a center of moon-god worship. This, however, is precarious, because Urumma or Urima in Abraham&#x27;s day was a Sumerian center, and the seat of Nannar-worship, whereas Haran was Semitic, and was dedicated to Sin. Although these two deities in later centuries were identified with each other, still the argument seems to have little weight, as other deities were also prominently worshipped in those cities, particularly Haran, which fact reminds us also that the Talmud says Terah worshipped no less than 12 deities.It should be stated that there are scholars who hold, with the Septuagint, that Ur means, not a city, but perhaps a land in which the patriarch pastured his flocks, as for instance, the land of Uri or Ura (Akkad). The designation &quot;of the Chaldeans&quot; was in this case intended to distinguish it from the land where they were not found.Still another identification is the town Uru (Mar-tu) near Sippar, a place of prominence in the time of Abraham, but which was lost sight of in subsequent periods (compare Amurru, 167). This fact would account for the failure to identify the place in the late pre-Christian centuries, when Urima or Uru still flourished. Western Semites--for the name Abram is not Babylonian--lived in this city in large numbers in the age when the p...</p>

          <p>u-ri&#x27;-a, u-ri&#x27;-ja (&#x27;uriyah, in Jer 26:20 &#x27;uriyahu, &quot;flame of Yahweh&quot; or &quot;my light is Yahweh&quot;; the Septuagint and the New Testament Our(e)ias, with variants; the King James Version has Urijah in 2Ki 16:10-16; Ne 3:4,21; 8:4; Jer 26:20):(1) A Hittite, who had settled in Jerusalem at the time of David and who had entered David&#x27;s service. He had become a worshipper of Yahweh (judging from the usual interpretations of his name) and had married a Hebrew wife, BATH-SHEBA (which see). David&#x27;s sin with this woman occurred while Uriah was engaged in warfare, and David had him recalled to Jerusalem in order to hide what had transpired. Uriah, however, felt himself bound by the consecration of a soldier (compare 1Sa 21:5; De 23:10 f) and refused to do violence to his religion, so that David&#x27;s ruse was in vain. (The point is missed here by speaking of Uriah&#x27;s &quot;chivalrous determination,&quot; as in HDB, IV, 837.) David, in desperation, wrote Joab instructions that were virtually a command to have Uriah murdered, and these instructions were duly carried out (2Sa 11:2-27). The inclusion of Uriah&#x27;s name in the list of the &quot;mighty men&quot; in 2Sa 23:39 parallel Ch 11:41 is proof of his reputation as a soldier, and the name is found also in 2Sa 12:9,10,15; 1Ki 15:5; Mt 1:6. On the occurrence in Matthew see especially Heffern, JBL, XXXI, 69 ff (1912).(2) A priest under Ahaz, who carried into effect the latter&#x27;s commands to introduce an Assyrian altar into the Temple and to use it for the sacrifices (2Ki 16:10-16; see ALTAR). The same Uriah appears in Isa 8:2 as one of the two &quot;faithful witnesses&quot; taken by Isaiah in the matter of Maher-shalal-hash-baz. This description has seemed to many to conflict with Uriah&#x27;s compliancy in obeying Ahaz, but it must be remembered that(a) &quot;faithful witness&quot; means simply &quot;one whom the people will believe,&quot; and(b) the articles in the sanctuary were not held as immutably sacred in the time of Ahaz as they were in later days.The omission of Uriah&#x27;s name from the list in 1Ch 6:10-14 is probably without significance, as Chronicles records only nine names from Solomon to the exile, showing that there must be many omissions. The corresponding list in Josephus, Ant, X, viii, 6, contains 18 names, including Uriah&#x27;s.(3) A son of Shemaiah, of Kiriath-jearim, and a contemporary of Jeremiah. He was a prophet, and his prophecy agreed with Jeremiah&#x27;s in regards. Jehoiakim, roused to anger, arrested him, even at the trouble of a pursuit into Egypt, put him to death and desecrated his body (Jer 20-23). The story is told partly in order to show the greatness of Jeremiah&#x27;s dangers, partly to bear record of the goodness of AHIKAM (which see), Jeremiah&#x27;s protector.(4) A priest, the father of MEREMOTH (which see) (Ezr 8:33; Ne 3:4,21; 1 Esdras 8:62 (&quot;Urias,&quot; the King James Version &quot;Iri&quot;)).(5) One of those on Ezra&#x27;s right hand reading of the Law (Ne 8:4; 1 Esdras 9:43 (&quot;Urias&quot;)). Quite possibly identical with (4) above.Burton Scott Easton</p>

He was the angel who instructed Ezra (2 Esdras 4:1; 5:20; 10:28). In Enoch 20:2 Uriel is the angel who is &quot;over the world and Tartarus&quot; (ho epi tou kosmou kai tou tartarou), and as such is the conductor to Enoch in the world below, the secrets of which he explains. Compare also (Greek) 19:1; 21:5. In the (Latin) &quot;Life of Adam and Eve,&quot; 48 (ed. W. Meyer in Abhand. d. Bayer. Akad. der Wiss., XIV, 1878, 250), Uriel (Oriel) accompanied Michael when at God&#x27;s bidding he wrapped the bodies of Adam and Abel in three linen sheets and buried them in Paradise. In the lost &quot;Prayer of Joseph&quot; Uriel is the angel who wrestles and converses with Jacob and knows the secrets of heaven (as in Enoch those of Tartarus), but stands only 8th in rank, whereas in (Greek) Enoch 20:2 ff he is the 1st of the six (or seven) archangels. In Sib Or 2:229 he is entrusted with the judgment of the Titans. Compare Milton, Paradise Lost, III, 690, &quot;regent of the sun, and held the sharpest sighted Spirit of all in heaven.&quot;(2) &quot;Urier&quot; the King James Version = the Revised Version (British and American) and the King James Version margin &quot;Jeremiel.&quot;S.

          <h3>URIM AND THUMMIM</h3>
          <p>u&#x27;-rim and thum&#x27;-im (ha-&#x27;urim weha-tummim (article omitted in Ezr 2:63; Ne 7:65); perhaps &quot;light and perfection,&quot; as intensive plurals):1. Definition:Articles not specifically described, placed in (next to, or on (Hebrew &#x27;el; Septuagint epi; Samaritan-Hebrew `al)) the high priest&#x27;s breastplate, called the &quot;breast-plate of decision&quot; (English Versions of the Bible, &quot;judgment&quot;). (Ex 28:30; Le 8:8). Their possession was one of the greatest distinctions conferred upon the priestly family (De 33:8; Ecclesiasticus 45:10), and seems to have been connected with the function of the priests as the mouthpiece of Yahweh, as well as with the ceremonial side of the service (Ex 28:30; compare Arabic kahin, &quot;soothsayer&quot;).2. Use in the Old Testament:Through their use, the nature of which is a matter of conjecture, the divine will was sought in national crises, and apparently the future foretold, guilt or innocence established, and, according to one theory, land divided (Babha&#x27; Bathra&#x27; 122a; Sanhedrin 16a). Thus, Joshua was to stand before Eleazar who was to inquire for him after the judgment (decision) of the Urim (Nu 27:21). It seems that this means was employed by Joshua in the matter of Achan (Jos 7:14,18) and overlooked in the matter of the Gibeonites (9:14). Though not specifically mentioned, the same means is in all probability referred to in the accounts of the Israelites consulting Yahweh after the death of Joshua in their warfare (Jud 1:1,2; 20:18,26-28). The Danites in their migration ask counsel of a priest, perhaps in a similar manner (Jud 18:5,7). It is not impossible that even the prophet Samuel was assisted by the Urim in the selection of a king (1Sa 10:20-22). During Saul&#x27;s war with the Philistines, he made inquiry of God with the aid of the priest (1Sa 14:36,37), Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, who at that time wore the ephod (1Sa 14:3). Although on two important occasions Yahweh refused to answer Saul through the Urim (1Sa 14:37; 28:6), it appears (from the Septuagint version of 1Sa 14:41; see below) that he Used the Urim and Thummim successfully in ascertaining the cause of the divine displeasure. The accusation of Doeg and the answer of the high priest (1Sa 22:10,13,15) suggest that David began to inquire of Yahweh through the priesthood, even while he was an officer of Saul. After the massacre of the priests in Nob, Abiathar fled to the camp of David (1Sa 22:20), taking with him the ephod (including apparently the Urim and Thummim, 1Sa 23:6) which David used frequently during his wanderings (1Sa 23:2-4,9-12; 30:7,8), and also after the death of Saul (2Sa 2:1; 5:19,23; 21:1). After the days of David, prophecy was in the ascendancy, and, accordingly, we find no clear record of the use of the Urim and Thummim in the days of the later kings (compare, however, Ho 3:4; Ecclesiasticus 33:3). Still, in post-exilic times we find the difficult question of the ancestral right of certain priests to eat of the most holy things reserved till there would stand up...</p>

          <h3>USURY</h3>
          <p>u&#x27;-zhu-ri:1. In the Old Testament:The Hebrew law concerning exaction of interest upon loans was very humane. Hebrews were to lend to their brethren without interest (Ex 22:25; Le 25:36 f; De 23:19 f). This, however, did not apply to a stranger (De 23:20). Two stems are used in the Old Testament, rendered in the King James Version &quot;usury,&quot; in the Revised Version (British and American) better rendered &quot;interest&quot;:(1) verb nashah (Ex 22:25; Isa 24:2; Jer 15:10), and the noun form, mashsha&#x27; (Ne 5:7,10);(2) a stronger and more picturesque word, nashakh, &quot;to bite,&quot; &quot;to vex,&quot; and so &quot;to lend on interest&quot; (De 23:19,20); noun form neshekh (Ex 22:25; Le 25:36 f; Ps 15:5; Pr 28:8; Eze 18:8,13,17; 22:12).It would be easy to go from a fair rate of interest to an unfair rate, as seen in the history of the word &quot;usury,&quot; which has come to mean an exorbitant or unlawful interest. Abuses arose during the exile. Nehemiah forced the people after the return to-give back exactions of &quot;one hundredth,&quot; or 1 percent monthly which they took from their brethren (Ne 5:10 f; compare Eze 22:12). A good citizen of Zion is one who did not put out his money to usury (Ps 15:5). One who is guilty of this comes to disaster (Pr 28:8).2. In the New Testament:The Greek word is tokos, literally, &quot;offspring,&quot; interest springing out of the principal. Money lenders were numerous among the Jews in Christ&#x27;s day, and, in the parable of the Talents, He represents the lord of the unprofitable servant as rebuking the sloth in the words, &quot;I should have received mine own with interest&quot; (Mt 25:27; Lu 19:23 the Revised Version (British and American)).Edward Bagby Pollard</p>

          <p>uz (uts &#x27;erets uts; Os, Ox, Ausitis):Biblical Data:(1) In Ge 10:23 Uz is the oldest son of Aram and grandson of Shem, while in 1Ch 1:17 Uz is the son of Shem. Septuagint inserts a passage which supplies this lacking name. As the tables of the nations in Ge 10 are chiefly geographical and ethnographical, Uz seems to have been the name of a district or nation colonized by or descended from Semites of the Aramean tribe or family.(2) The son of Nahor by Milcah, and older brother of Buz (Ge 2:21). Here the name is doubtless personal and refers to an individual who was head of a clan or tribe kindred to that of Abraham.(3) A son of Dishan, son of Seir the Horite (Ge 36:28), and personal name of a Horite or perhaps of mixed Horite and Aramean blood.(4) The native land and home of Job (Job 1:1), and so situated as to be in more or less proximity to the tribe of the Temanites (Job 2:11), the Shuhites (Job 2:11), the Naamathites (Job 2:11), the Buzites (Job 32:2), and open to the inroads of the Chaldeans (Job 1:17), and the Sabeans (Job 1:15 the Revised Version (British and American)), as well as exposed to the great Arabian Desert (1:19). See the next article.(5) A kingdom of some importance somewhere in Southern Syria and not far from Judea, having a number of kings (Jer 25:20).(6) A kingdom, doubtless the same as that of Jer 25:20 and inhabited by or in subjection to the Edomites (La 4:21), and hence not far from Edom.James Josiah Reeve</p>

          <h3>UZ (2)</h3>
          <p>(&#x27;uts; Septuagint Ausitis; Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) Ausitis): The home of the patriarch Job (Job 1:1; Jer 25:20, &quot;all the kings of the land of Uz&quot;; La 4:21, &quot;daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz&quot;). The land of Uz was, no doubt, the pasturing-ground inhabited by one of the tribes of that name, if indeed there be more than one tribe intended. The following are the determining data occurring in the Book of Job. The country was subject to raids by Chaldeans and Sabeans (1:15,17); Job&#x27;s three friends were a Temanite, a Naamathite and a Shuhite (2:11); Elihu was a Buzite (32:2); and Job himself is called one of the children of the East (Qedhem). The Chaldeans (kasdim, descendants of Chesed, son of Nahor, Ge 22:22) inhabited Mesopotamia; a branch of the Sabeans also appears to have taken up its abode in Northern Arabia (see SHEBA). Teman (Ge 36:11) is often synonymous with Edom. The meaning of the designation amathite is unknown, but Shuah was a son of Keturah the wife of Abraham (Ge 25:2), and so connected with Nahor. Shuah is identified with Suhu, mentioned by Tiglath-pileser I as lying one day&#x27;s journey from Carchemish; and a &quot;land of Uzza&quot; is named by Shalmaneser II as being in the same neighborhood. Buz is a brother of Uz (&quot;Huz,&quot; Ge 22:21) and son of Nahor. Esar-haddon, in an expedition toward the West, passed through Bazu and Hazu, no doubt the same tribes. Abraham sent his children, other than Isaac (so including Shuah), &quot;eastward to the land of Qedhem&quot; (Ge 25:6). These factors point to the land of Uz as lying somewhere to the Northeast of Palestine. Tradition supports such a site. Josephus says &quot;Uz founded Trachonitis and Damascus&quot; (Ant., I, vi, 4). Arabian tradition places the scene of Job s sufferings in the Hauran at Deir Eiyub (Job&#x27;s monastery) near Nawa. There is a spring there, which. he made to flow by striking the rock with his foot (Koran 38 41), and his tomb. The passage in the Koran is, however, also made to refer to Job&#x27;s Well.Compare JERUSALEM.LITERATURE.Talmud of Jerusalem (French translation by M.

Uzal as the name of a place perhaps occurs in Eze 27:19. the Revised Version (British and American) reads, &quot;Vedan and Javan traded with yarn for thy wares.&quot; Here an obscure verbal form, me&#x27;uzzal, is taken to mean &quot;something spun,&quot; &quot;yarn.&quot; But with a very slight change we may read me&#x27;uzal = &quot;from Uzal.&quot;The name is identical with the Arabic `Auzal, the old capital of Yemen, later called San`a&#x27;. San`a&#x27; is described as standing high above sea-level in a fertile land, and traversed by a river bed which in the rainy season becomes a torrent. Under the Himyarite dynasty it succeeded Zafar as the residence of the Tubba`s. If it is the same place as the Audzara or Ausara of the classics, it is clear why Arabic geographers dwell upon its great antiquity. The most celebrated feature of the town was Ghumdan, an immense palace, the building of which tradition ascribes to Shorabbil, the 6th known king of the Himyarites. According to Ibn Khaldoun this building had four fronts in color red, white, yellow and green respectively. In the midst rose a tower of seven stories, the topmost being entirely of marble (Caussin de Perceval, Essai, II, 75). In the 7th century AD the town became the capital of the Zaidite Imams, and the palace was destroyed toward the middle of that century by order of the caliph Othman.A. S. Fulton</p>

          <p>uz&#x27;-a, uz&#x27;-a (&#x27;uzzah (2Sa 6:6-8), otherwise `uzza&#x27; meaning uncertain):(1) One of those who accompanied the ark on its journey from Kiriath-jearim toward David&#x27;s citadel (2Sa 6:3-8, &quot;Uzzah&quot; = 1Ch 13:7-11, &quot;Uzza&quot;). From the text of 2Sa 6:3-8, as generally corrected with the help of Septuagint, it is supposed that Uzzah walked by the side of the ark while Ahio (or &quot;his brother&quot;) went in front of it. The word which describes what happened to the oxen is variously translated; the Revised Version (British and American) has &quot;stumbled&quot;; others render it, &quot;They let the oxen slip,&quot; &quot;The oxen shook (the ark).&quot; Uzzah, whatever it be that took place, caught hold of the ark; something else happened, and Uzzah died on the spot. If the word translated &quot;rashness&quot; (Revised Version margin) in 2Sa 6:7 (not &quot;error&quot; as English Versions of the Bible) is to be kept in the text, Uzzah would be considered guilty of too little reverence for the ark; but the words &quot;for (his) rashness&quot; are lacking in the Septuagint (Codex Vaticanus), while 1Ch 13:10 has &quot;because he put forth his hand to the ark,&quot; and further no such Hebrew word as we find here is known to us. The older commentators regarded the death as provoked by non-observance of the provisions about the ark as given in the Pentateuch, but it is generally believed today that these were not known in David&#x27;s time.What is clear is that Uzzah&#x27;s act led to an accident of some kind, and the event was regarded by David as inauspicious, so that the journey with the ark was discontinued. We know how the Old Testament writers represent events as due to divine intervention where we would perhaps discern natural causes.(2) The garden of Uzza (2Ki 21:18,26). Manasseh the king is said (2Ki 21:18) to have been &quot;buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza&quot;; and Amon (2Ki 21:26) &quot;was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza.&quot; It has been suggested that &quot;Uzza&quot;--&quot;Uzziah&quot; (&#x27;uzziyah) = Azariah&quot; (compare 2Ki 15:1-6). The garden of Manasseh would then be identical with that of Uzziah, by whom it was originally laid out. 2Ch 33:20 does not mention the garden.(3) Son of Shimei, a Merarite (1Ch 6:29 (Hebrew 14)), the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;Uzzah,&quot; the King James Version &quot;Uzza.&quot;(4) A descendant of Ehud, and head of a Benjamite family (1Ch 8:7, &quot;Uzza&quot;).

          <h3>UZZIAH; (AZARIAH)</h3>
          <p>u-zi&#x27;-a, oo-zi&#x27;-a (`uzziyah (2Ki 15:13,30; Ho 1:1; Am 1:1; Zec 14:5), `uzziyahu (2Ki 15:32,34; Isa 1:1; 6:1; 7:1; 2Ch 26:1 ff; 27:2); also called `azaryah (2Ki 14:21; 15:1,7; 1Ch 3:12), &#x27;azaryahu (2Ki 15:6,8); Azarias, in Kings, elsewhere Ozias; the significations of the names are similar, the former meaning &quot;my strength is Yah&quot;; the latter, &quot;Yah has helped.&quot; It has been thought that the form &quot;Uzziah&quot; may have originated by corruption from the other. The history of the reign is given in 2Ki 15:1-8 and 2Ch 26):1. Accession:  Uzziah or Azariah, son of Amaziah, and 11th king of Judah, came to the throne at the age of 16. The length of his reign is given as 52 years. The chronological questions raised by this statement are considered below. His accession may here be provisionally dated in 783 BC. His father Amaziah had met his death by popular violence (2Ki 14:19), but Uzziah seems to have been the free and glad choice of the people (2Ch 26:1).2. Foreign Wars:The unpopularity of his father, owing to a great military disaster, must ever have been present to the mind of Uzziah, and early in his reign he undertook and successfully carried through an expedition against his father&#x27;s enemies of 20 years before, only extending his operations over a wider area. The Edomites, Philistines and Arabians were successively subdued (these being members of a confederacy which, in an earlier reign, had raided Jerusalem and nearly extirpated the royal family, 2Ch 21:16; 22:1); the port of Eloth, at the head of the Red Sea, was restored to Judah, and the city rebuilt (2Ki 14:22; 2Ch 26:2); the walls of certain hostile towns, Gath, Jabneh and Ashdod, were razed to the ground, and the inhabitants of Gur-baal and Maan were reduced to subjection (2Ch 26:6,7). Even the Ammonites, East of the Jordan, paid tribute to Uzziah, and &quot;his name spread abroad even to the entrance to Egypt; for he waxed exceeding strong&quot; (2Ch 26:8).3. Home Defenses:Uzziah next turned his attention to securing the defenses of his capital and country. The walls of Jerusalem were strengthened by towers built at the corner gate, at the valley gate, and at an angle in the wall (see plan of Jerusalem in the writer&#x27;s Second Temple in Jerusalem); military stations were also formed in Philistia, and in the wilderness of the Negeb, and these were supplied with the necessary cisterns for rain storage (2Ch 26:6,10). The little realm had now an extension and prosperity to which it had been a stranger since the days of Solomon.4. Uzziah&#x27;s Leprosy and Retirement:These successes came so rapidly that Uzziah had hardly passed his 40th year when a great personal calamity overtook him. In the earlier part of his career Uzziah had enjoyed and profited by the counsels of Zechariah, a man &quot;who had understanding in the vision of God&quot; (2Ch 26:5), and during the lifetime of this godly monitor &quot;be set himself to seek God.&quot; Now it happened to him as with his grandfather Jehoash, who, so long as his preserver Jehoiada lived, act...</p>
