          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">la&#x27;-ban: The person named Laban, labhan; (Laban, possibly connected with the root meaning &quot;to be white,&quot; from which in Hebrew the adjective meaning &quot;white&quot; has just this form) is first introduced to the reader of Genesis in the story of the wooing of Rebekah (Genesis 24). He belonged to that branch of the family of Terah that was derived from Abraham&#x27;s brother Nahor and his niece Milcah. The genealogy of this branch is traced in Ge 22:20-24; but, true to its purpose and the place it occupies in the book, this genealogy brings the family down to Rebekah, and there stops without mentioning Laban. Accordingly, when Rebekah is introduced in the narrative of Genesis 24, she is referred to (24:15,24) in a way that recalls to the reader the genealogy already given; but when her brother Laban is introduced (24:29), he is related to his sister by the express announcement, &quot;And Rebekah had brother, and his name was Laban.&quot; In this chapter he takes prominent part in the reception of Abraham&#x27;s servant, and in the determination of his sister&#x27;s future. That brothers had an effective voice in the marriage of their sisters is evident, not only from extra-Biblical sources, but from the Bible itself; see e.g. So 8:8. In Ge 24, however, Laban is perhaps more prominent than even such custom can explain (compare 24:31,50,55), and we are led to see in him already the same forcefulness and egotism that are abundantly shown in the stories from his later life. The man&#x27;s eager hospitality (verse 31), coming immediately after his mental inventory of the gifts bestowed by the visitor upon his sister (24:30), has usually, and justly, been regarded as a proof of the same greed that is his most conspicuous characteristic in the subsequent chapters.The story of that later period in Laban&#x27;s life is so interwoven with the career of Jacob that little need here be added to what is said of Laban in JACOB, III, 2 (which see). By the time of Jacob&#x27;s arrival he is already a very old man, for over 90 years had elapsed since Rebekah&#x27;s departure. Yet even at the end of Jacob&#x27;s 20 years&#x27; residence with him he is represented as still energetic and active (Ge 31:19,23), not only ready for an emergency like the pursuit after Jacob, but personally superintending the management of his huge flocks.His home is in Haran, &quot;the city of Nahor,&quot; that is, the locality where Nahor and his family remained at the time when the rest of Terah&#x27;s descendants emigrated to Canaan (Ge 11:31; 12:5). Since Haran, and the region about it where his flocks fed, belonged to the district called Aram (see PADDAN-ARAM; MESOPOTAMIA), Laban is often called &quot;the Aramean&quot; (English Versions of the Bible, &quot;the Syrian,&quot; from Septuagint 5 ho Suros); see Ge 25:20; 28:5; 31:20,24. It is uncertain how far racial affinity may be read into this term, because the origin and mutual relationships of the various groups or strata of the Sere family are not yet clear. For Laban himself it suffices that he was a Semite, living within the re...</p>

Examples of the word in the ordinary sense are: of yeghia`, Ge 31:42; Job 39:11,16; Ps 128:2; of `amal, common in Ec 1:3,8; 2:10,11,18, etc.; of kopos, 1Co 15:58 (&quot;your labor is not vain,&quot; etc.); 1Th 1:3 (&quot;work of faith and labor of love&quot;; compare Heb 6:10); 1Ti 5:17 (&quot;labor in the word and in teaching&quot;).See WORK; SLAVERY.James Orr</p>

The alliance mentioned in 1 Macc 12:5-23 is based, among other grounds, on that of a common descent of Jews and Lacedaemonians from Abraham, for which the only probable presumption--suggested by Ewald--is the similarity of names, &quot;Pelasgi&quot; and Peleg son of Eber (Ge 10:25; 11:16). This has been reasonably objected to, and perhaps the most that can be said on this point is that the belief in some relationship between the Jews and the Lacedaemonians seems to have prevailed when 1 Macc was written. The alliance itself is said to have been formed (1 Macc 12:20) between Areus, king of the Lacedaemonians and Onias the high priest; but it is not easy to make out a consistent chronology for the transaction. For the renewal of the alliance (circa 144 BC) by Jonathan (1 Macc 12:5-18) and again by Simon (1 Macc 14:16-23), something can be said, as the Greeks had finally been deprived of independence in 146 BC, and Sparta was only obliged to lend assistance to Rome and may be supposed to have been doing so in helping the Jews against Syria. It is possible, too, that as against Syrian Hellenism the Jews were anxious to show that they had the assistance of distinguished Greeks, though the actual power of Sparta was much reduced from that of former times. The facts, at least of the alliance and the correspondence, seem to be sufficiently attested, though it is not easy to reconcile all the particulars. Josephus (Ant., XII, iv, 10; XIII, v, 8; XIV, xii, 2,3) gives the correspondence at greater length than the writer of the Maccabees.J. Hutchison</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">la&#x27;-kish (lakhish; Septuagint Lachis (Jos 15:39), Maches):1. Location:A town in the foothills of the Shephelah on the border of the Philistine plain, belonging to Judah, and, from the mention of Eglon in connection with it, evidently in the southwestern portion of Judah&#x27;s territory. Eusebius, Onomasticon locates it 7 miles from Eleutheropolis (Beit Jibrin) toward Daroma, but as the latter place is uncertain, the indication does not help in fixing the site of Lachish. The city seems to have been abandoned about 400 BC, and this circumstance has rendered the identification of the site difficult. It was formerly fixed at Umm Lakis, from the similarity of the name and because it was in the region that the Biblical references to Lachish seem to indicate, but the mound called Tell el-Hesy is now generally accepted as the site. This was first suggested by Conder in 1877 (PEFS, 1878, 20), and the excavations carried on at the Tell by the Palestine Exploration Fund in 1890-93 confirmed his identification. Tell el-Hesy is situated on a wady, or valley, of the same name (Wady el Hesy), which runs from a point about 6 miles West of Hebron to the sea between Gaza and Askelon. It is a mound on the very edge of the wady, rising some 120 ft. above it and composed of debris to the depth of about 60 ft., in which the excavations revealed the remains of distinct cities which had been built, one upon the ruins of another. The earliest of these was evidently Amorite, and could not have been later than 1700 BC, and was perhaps two or three centuries earlier (Bliss, Mound of Many Cities). The identification rests upon the fact that the site corresponds with the Biblical and other historical notices of Lachish, and especially upon the discovery of a cuneiform tablet in the ruins of the same character as the Tell el-Amarna Letters, and containing the name of Zimridi, who is known from these tablets to have been at one time Egyptian governor of Lachish. The tablets, which date from the latter part of the 15th or early part of the 14th century BC, give us the earliest information in regard to Lachish, and it was then an Egyptian dependency, but it seems to have revolted and joined with other towns in an attack upon Jerusalem, which was also an Egyptian dependency. It was perhaps compelled to do so by the Khabiri who were then raiding this region. The place was, like Gaza, an important one for Egypt, being on the frontier and on the route to Jerusalem, and the importance is seen in the fact that it was taken and destroyed and rebuilt so many times.2. History:We first hear of it in the history of Israel when Joshua invaded the land. It was then an Amorite city, and its king, Japhia, joined the confederacy formed by Adonizedek, king of Jerusalem, to resist Joshua. They were defeated in the remarkable battle at Gibeon, and the five confederate kings were captured and put to death at Makkedah (Jos 10 passim; Jos 12:11). Lachish was included in the lot of Judah (15:39), and it w...</p>

Sometimes one of the common synonyms is exchanged for the word itself, e.g. in the Old Testament, 1Sa 21:15 the Revised Version (British and American) has &quot;lack&quot; (&quot;Do I lack madmen?&quot;) where the King James Version has &quot;need of&quot;; Pr 5:23, &quot;for lack,&quot; instead of &quot;without&quot;; 6:32, &quot;void of&quot; for &quot;lacketh&quot;; 10:21, &quot;lack&quot; for &quot;want&quot;; 31:11, &quot;lack&quot; for &quot;need&quot;; Isa 59:15, &quot;lacking&quot; for &quot;faileth.&quot; In the New Testament &quot;lack&quot; is the translation of hustereo, literally, &quot;to be behind,&quot; and endees, &quot;in want.&quot; In Lu 8:6, the Revised Version (British and American) reads &quot;had no&quot; instead of &quot;lacked&quot; in the King James Version. In 2Co 11:9, the Revised Version gives &quot;my want&quot; for &quot;which was lacking to me&quot; in the King James Version; in Col 1:24 &quot;that which is lacking&quot; for &quot;that which is behind&quot;; Jas 2:15 &quot;lack&quot; for &quot;destitute.&quot; It will readily be seen that sometimes the slight variation helps to explain the meaning.G.

The Ladder has been located at different points on the coast between Tyre and Acre, such as the Ras el-`Abyadh (&quot;Promontorium Album&quot; of the ancient geographers), about 7 miles South of Tyre, and Ras en-Naqurah, about 6 miles farther South, and Ras el-Musheirifeh, a little farther on. These are capes jutting westward into the sea from the ridge which runs parallel to the general line of the coast. These capes project more than a mile into the sea, and present a very bold and precipitous front from 200 to 300 ft. in height. The ascent on either side of the promontory is very steep, and at Ras el-`Abyadh steps were cut in the white rock, which led to the identification of this point with the Ladder, but a reference to Josephus (B J, II, x, 2) leads to a different conclusion. He locates it 100 stadia North of Acre, which corresponds fairly well with the southern limit of the whole promontory, which is about 12 miles North of Acre, but not at all with Ras el-`Abyadh. The altitude of el Musheirifeh is greater than that of el-`Abyadh and may have had steps cut in it similar to the latter. It is more probable that the Ladder of Tyre was here, or at en-Naqurah, but the term applied to the whole promontory, which offered a serious obstacle to the passage of armies, or even caravans, since the approach is precipitous on either side, and at Ras el-`Abyadh the road skirts the edge of a sheer precipice, where a misstep would hurl one into the sea some 200 ft. below. The application of the term to the whole promontory seems to be indicated by Josephus, since he speaks of it as one of the mountains which encompass the plain of Ptolemais (Acre) and the highest of all. This would not be true of any one of the three capes mentioned, but would be if the hills behind, which form their base, were included. That it was designated as the Ladder of Tyre rather than of Acre was probably due to the fact that the promontory is nearer the former city (see Thomson, LB, II, edition 1882; SWP, name-lists, under the word).H.

The Dead Sea, which might be called a lake, is in most places in English Versions of the Bible called the Salt Sea. It is called by the Arabs Bachr Lut, Sea of Lot. It is a question whether the Waters of Merom (Jos 11:5,7) can be identified with the Chuleh, a marshy lake in the course of the Upper Jordan, North of the Sea of Galilee. East of Damascus on the edge of the desert there are saltish lakes in which the water of the rivers of Damascus (see 2Ki 5:12) is gathered and evaporates. In the Lebanon West of Ba`albek is the small Lake Yammuneh, which is fed by copious springs, but whose water disappears in the latter part of the summer, being drained off by subterranean channels.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(limne tou puros): Found in Re 19:20; 20:10,14(bis),15. Re 21:8 has &quot;the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone.&quot; The brimstone in connection with &quot;the lake of fire&quot; occurs also in Re 19:20 and 10, the latter being a backward reference to the former passage. In Re 20:14 the words, &quot;This is the second death, even the lake of fire&quot; are either a gloss originally intended to elucidate 20:15 through a reference to 20:6, or, if part of the text, formed originally the close of 20:15, whence they became displaced on account of the identity of the words once immediately preceding them in 20:15 with the words now preceding them in 20:14. The &quot;lake of fire&quot; can be called &quot;the second death&quot; only with reference to the lost among men (20:15), not with reference to death and Hades (20:14). In all the above references &quot;the lake of fire&quot; appears as a place of punishment, of perpetual torment, not of annihilation (20:10). The beast (19:20); the pseudo-prophet (19:20; 20:10); the devil (20:10); the wicked of varying description (20:15; 21:8), are cast into it. When the same is affirmed of death and Hades (20:14), it is doubtful whether this is meant as a mere figure for the cessation of these two evils personified, or has a more realistic background in the existence of two demon-powers so named (compare Isa 25:8; 1Co 15:26,54 ff; 2 Esdras 7:31). The Scriptural source for the conception of &quot;the lake of fire&quot; lies in Ge 19:24, where already the fire and the brimstone occur together, while the locality of the catastrophe described is the neighborhood of the Dead Sea. The association of the Dead Sea with this fearful judgment of God, together with the desolate appearance of the place, rendered it a striking figure for the scene of eschatological retribution. The two other Old Testament passages which have &quot;fire and brimstone&quot; (Ps 11:6; Eze 38:22) are dependent on the Ge passage, with which they have the figure of &quot;raining&quot; in common. In Re 21:8, &quot;their part&quot; seems to allude to Ps 11:6, &quot;the portion of their cup.&quot; In Enoch 67:4 ff the Dead Sea appears as the place of punishment for evil spirits. Of late it has been proposed to derive &quot;the lake of fire&quot; from &quot;the stream of fire&quot; which destroys the enemies of Ahura in the Zoroastrian eschatology; so Bousset, Die Offenbarung Johannis, 1906, 433, 434. But the figures of a stream and a lake are different; compare 2 Esdras 13:9-11, where a stream of fire proceeds from the mouth of the Messiah for the destruction of His enemies. Besides, the Persian fire is, in part, a fire of purification, and not of destruction only (Bousset, 442), and even in the apocalyptic Book of Enoch, the fires of purification and of punishment are not confounded (compare Enoch 67:4 with 90:20). The Old Testament fully explains the entire conception.Geerhardus Vos</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(ho amnos tou theou): This is a title specially bestowed upon our Lord by John the Baptist (Joh 1:29-36), &quot;Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!&quot; In Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs an apocryphal book, probably of the 2nd century--we have the term used for the Messiah, &quot;Honor Judah and Levi, for from them shall arise for you the Lamb of God, saving all nations by grace.&quot; But the term does not seem to have been of any general use until it received its distinctly Christian significance. It has been generally understood as referring to the prophetic language of Jer 11:19, and Isa 53:7.1. Sacrificial Sense of the Term:It is far more probable, however, that the true source of the expression is to be found in the important place which the &quot;lamb&quot; occupies in the sacrifices, especially of the Priestly Code. In these there was the lamb of the daily morning and evening sacrifice. How familiar this would be to the Baptist, being a member of a priestly family! On the Sabbath the number of the offerings was doubled, and at some of the great festivals a still larger number were laid upon the altar (see Ex 29:38; Nu 28:3,9,13). The lamb of the Passover would also occupy a large place in the mind of a devout Israelite, and, as the Passover was not far off, it is quite possible that John may have referred to this as well as to other suggested ideas connected with the lamb. The sacrificial significance of the term seems to be far more probable than the mere comparison of the character of our Lord with meekness and gentleness, as suggested by the words of the prophets, although these contain much more than the mere reference to character (see below). That this became the clearly defined conception of apostolic teaching is clear from passages in Paul and Peter (1Co 5:7; 1Pe 1:18 f). In the Book of Revelation the reference to the Lamb occurs 27 times. The word here used differs from that in John. The amnos of the Gospel has become the arnion of the Apocalypse, a diminutive form suggestive of affection. This is the word used by our Lord in His rebuke and forgiveness of Peter (Joh 21:15), and is peculiarly touched therefore with an added meaning of pathetic tenderness. Westcott, in his Commentary on Joh 1:29, refers to the conjecture that there may have been flocks of lambs passing by on their way to Jerusalem to be used at the feast. This is possible, but fanciful. As applied to Christ, the term certainly suggests the meekness and gentleness of our Lord&#x27;s nature and work, but could not have been used by John without containing some reference to the place which the lamb bore in the Judaic ritualism.2. As Variously Understood:The significance of the Baptist&#x27;s words has been variously understood. Origen, Cyril, Chrysostom, among the ancients, Lucke, DeWette, Meyer, Ewald, Alford, among the moderns, refer it to Isa 53:7; Grotius, Bengel, Hengstenberg, to the paschal lamb; Baumgarten-Crusius, etc., to the sin offering; Lange strongly urges the i...</p>

The offering of animals so blemished was one of the sins with which Malachi charges the negligent Jews of his time (Mal 1:8-13).(2) Those who suffered from lameness, such as Mephibosheth, whose limbs were injured by a fall in childhood (2Sa 4:4; 9:3). In the prophetic description of the completeness of the victory of the returning Israelites, it is predicted that the lame shall be made whole and shall leap like a hart (Jer 3:18; Isa 35:6). The unfitness of the lame for warfare gives point to the promise that the lame shall take the prey (Isa 33:23). Job in his graphic description of his helpfulness to the weak before his calamity says, &quot;And feet was I to the lame&quot; (Job 29:15). The inequality of the legs of the lame is used in Pr 26:7 as a similitude of the ineptness with which a fool uses a parable.In the enigmatical and probably corrupt passage describing David&#x27;s capture of Jerusalem, the lame and blind are mentioned twice. In 2Sa 5:6 it was a taunt on the part of the Jebusites that even a garrison of cripples would suffice to keep out the Israelites. The allusion in 5:8 may be read, &quot;Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites let him .... slay both the lame and blind, which hate David&#x27;s soul&quot; as it is in Septuagint. The Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) says, &quot;David had offered a reward on that day to the man who should smite the Jebusite and reach the water pipes of the houses, and remove the blind and lame who hated David&#x27;s soul.&quot; It is possible, however, that Budde&#x27;s emendation is more correct and that it is a threat against the indiscriminate slaughter of the Jebusites: &quot;Whoso slayeth a Jebusite shall bring his neck into peril; the lame and blind are not hated of David&#x27;s soul.&quot; The proverbial saying quoted in 5:8 cannot be correct as rendered in the King James Version, for we read in Mt 21:14 that the lame came to our Lord in the temple and were healed.The healing of the lame by our Lord is recorded in Mt 11:5; 15:30,31; 21:14; Lu 7:22; 14:13. For the apostolic miracles of healing the lame, see CRIPPLE. In Heb 12:13 the Christians are counseled to courage under chastisement, lest their despair should cause that which is lame to be &quot;turned out of the way.&quot;Alexander Macalister</p>

Here Lamech, the son of Methushael, is named as the last of the descendants of Cain. He was the father of Jabel, Jubal, Tubal-cain, and Naamah. As the husband of two wives, namely, Adah and Zillah, he furnishes the first recorded instance of polygamy. It is very instructive to note that this &quot;father of polygamy&quot; at once becomes the first blustering tyrant and a braggadocio; we are fully permitted to draw this conclusion from his so-called &quot;swordlay&quot; (Ge 4:23 f). He does not put his trust in God, but in the weapons and implements invented by his sons, or rather these instruments, enhancing the physical and material powers of man, are his God. He glories in them and misconstrues the Divine kindness which insured to Cain freedom from the revenge of his fellow-men.(2) Another Lamech. is mentioned in Ge 5:25,28 (compare 1Ch 1:3; Lu 3:36), the son of Methuselah and the father of Noah. His words (Ge 5:29) show the great difference between this descendant of Seth and the descendant of Cain. While the one is stimulated to a song of defiance by the worldly inventions of his sons, the other, in prophetical mood, expresses his sure belief in the coming of better times, and calmly and prayerfully awaits the period of comfort and rest which he expected to be ushered in by his son Noah.William Baur</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">lam-en-ta&#x27;-shunz,--The Lamentations of Jeremiah:1. Name:This is a collective name which tradition has given to 5 elegies found in the Hebrew Canon that lament the fate of destroyed Jerusalem. The rabbis call this little book &#x27;Ekhah (&quot;how&quot;), according to the word of lament with which it begins, or qinoth. On the basis of the latter term the Septuagint calls it threnoi, or Latin Threni, or &quot;Lamentations.&quot;2. Form:The little book consists of 5 lamentations, each one forming the contents of a chapter. The first 4 are marked by the acrostic use of the alphabet. In addition, the qinah (&quot;elegy&quot;) meter is found in these hymns, in which a longer line (3 or 4 accents) is followed by a shorter (2 or 3 accents). In La 1 and 2 the acrostic letters begin three such double lines; in La 4, however, two double lines. In La 3 a letter controls three pairs, but is repeated at the beginning of each line. In La 5 the alphabet is wanting; but in this case too the number of pairs of lines agrees with the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet, i.e. 22. In La 2; 3 and 4, the letter `ayin (`) follows pe (p), as is the case in Ps 34. Lamentations 1, however, follows the usual order.3. Contents:These 5 hymns all refer to the great national catastrophe that overtook the Jews and in particular the capital city, Jerusalem, through the Chaldeans, 587-586 BC. The sufferings and the anxieties of the city, the destruction of the sanctuary, the cruelty and taunts of the enemies of Israel, especially the Edomites, the disgrace that befell the king and his nobles, priests and prophets, and that, too, not without their own guilt, the devastation and ruin of the country--all this is described, and appeal is made to the mercy of God. A careful sequence of thought cannot be expected in the lyrical feeling and in the alphabetical form. Repetitions are found in large numbers, but each one of these hymns emphasizes some special feature of the calamity. Lamentations 3 is unique, as in it one person describes his own peculiar sufferings in connection with the general calamity, and then too in the name of the others begins a psalm of repentance. This person did not suffer so severely because he was an exceptional sinner, but because of the unrighteousness of his people. These hymns were not written during the siege, but later, at a time when the people still vividly remembered the sufferings and the anxieties of that time and when the impression made on them by the fall of Jerusalem was still as powerful as ever.4. Author:Who is the author of these hymns? Jewish tradition is unanimous in saying that it was Jeremiah. The hymns themselves are found anonymously in the Hebrew text, while the Septuagint has in one an additional statement, the Hebrew style of which would lead us to conclude that it was found in the original from which the version was made. This statement reads: &quot;And it came to pass, after Israel had been taken away captive and Jerusalem had been laid waste, that Jeremiah sat weepi...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">lamp&#x27;-stand (nir, ner, lappidh, Phoenician lampadh, whence lampas; luchnos is also used): Ner or nir is properly &quot;light&quot; or &quot;a light-giving thing,&quot; hence, &quot;lamp,&quot; and is so rendered in the Revised Version (British and American), but often &quot;candle&quot; in the King James Version. Its use in connection with the tabernacle and the temple (Ex 25:37 ff; 2Ch 4:20 f), where oil was employed for light (Ex 35:14; Le 24:2), shows that this is its proper meaning. Lappidh is properly &quot;a torch&quot; and is thus rendered generally in the Revised Version (British and American), but &quot;lamp&quot; in Isa 62:1, where it is used as a simile. the King James Version renders it &quot;lamp&quot; usually, but &quot;torch&quot; in Na 2:3 f; Zec 12:6. In Job 12:5 the Revised Version (British and American) renders it &quot;for misfortune,&quot; regarding it as composed of the noun pidh, and the preposition l-. Lampas in Greek corresponds to it, but luchnos is also rendered in the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;lamp,&quot; while the King James Version gives &quot;candle,&quot; as in Mt 5:15 and corresponding passages in the other Gospels.1. Forms and History:Lamps were in use in very remote times, though we have few allusions to them in the early history of Egypt. There are indications that they were used there. Niches for lamps are found in the tombs of Tell el-Amarna (Archaeological Survey of Egypt, Tell el-Amarna Letters, Part IV, 14). Lampstands are also represented (ibid., Part III, 7). Torches were of course used before lamps, and are mentioned in Ge (15:17 the Revised Version (British and American)), but clay lamps were used in Canaan by the Amorites before the Israelites took possession. The excavations in Palestine have furnished thousands of specimens, and have enabled us to trace the development from about 2000 BC onward. The exploration carried out at Lachish (Tell Hesy) and Gezer (Tell Jezer) by the Palestine Exploration Fund has given ample material for the purpose, and the numerous examples from tombs all over Palestine and Syria have supplied a great variety of forms.2. Figurative Use:&quot;Lamp&quot; is used in the sense of a guide in Ps 119:105; Pr 6:23, and for the spirit, which is called the lamp of Yahweh in man (Pr 20:27), and it of course often signifies the light itself. It is used also for the son who is to succeed and represent his father (1Ki 15:4), and it perhaps is employed in this sense in the phrase, &quot;The lamp of the wicked shall be put out&quot; (Job 21:17; Pr 13:9; and perhaps Job 18:6).The early Canaanite or Amorite lamp was a shallow, saucer-like bowl with rounded bottom and vertical rim, slightly pointed or pinched on one side where the lighted end of the wick was placed. This form continued into Jewish times, but was gradually changed until the spout was formed by drawing the rim of the sides together, forming a narrow open channel, the remainder of the rim being rolled outward and flattened, the bottom being also flattened. This was the early Hebrew pattern and persisted for centuries. The open bowl was...</p>

The Vernacular &quot;Koine&quot; the Language of the New Testament.1. The Old Point of View:The ghost of the old Purist controversy is now laid to rest for good and all. The story of that episode has interest chiefly for the historian of language and of the vagaries of the human intellect. See Winer-Thayer, Grammar of the Idiom of the New Testament, 1869, 12-19, and Schmiedel&#x27;s Winer, sectopm 2, for a sketch of this once furious strife. In the 17th century various scholars tried to prove that the Greek of the New Testament was on a paragraph with the literary Attic of the classic period. But the Hebraists won the victory over them and sought to show that it was Hebraic Greek, a special variety, if not dialect, a Biblical Greek The 4th edition of Cremer&#x27;s Biblico-Theological Lexicon of New Testament Greek (translated by W. Urwick, 1892) quotes, with approval, Rothe&#x27;s remark (Dogmatik, 1863, 238):&quot;We may appropriately speak of a language of the Holy Ghost. For in the Bible it is evident that the Holy Spirit has been at work, moulding for itself a distinctively religious mode of expression out of the language of the country which it has chosen as its sphere, and transforming the linguistic elements which it found ready to hand, and even conceptions already existing, into a shape and form appropriate to itself and all its own.&quot; Cremer adds: &quot;We have a very clear and striking proof of this in New Testament Greek.&quot;This was only twenty years ago and fairly represented the opinion of that day. Hatch in 1889 (Essays in Biblical Greek, 34) held that with most of the New Testament words the key lay in the Septuagint. But Winer (Winer-Thayer, 20) had long ago seen that the vernacular koine was &quot;the special foundation of the diction of the New Testament,&quot; though he still admitted &quot;a Jewish-Greek, which native Greeks did not entirely understand&quot; (p. 27). He did not see the practical identity of New Testament Greek with the vernacular koine--(&quot;common&quot; Greek), nor did Schmiedel in the 8. Auflage of Winer (I. Theil; II. Theil, erstes Heft, 1894-97). In the second edition of his Grammar of New Testament Greek (English translation by Thackeray, 1905, 2), Blass sees the dawn of the new day, though his book was first written before it came. Viteau (Etude sur le grec du Nouveau Testament, I, Le verbe, 1893, II, Le sujet, 1896) occupies wholly the old position of a Judaic Greek. An extreme instance of that view is seen in Guillemard&#x27;s Hebraisms in the Greek Testament (1879).2. The Revolution...</p>

Hebrew Easy of TranslationLITERATUREThere were only two languages employed in the archetypes of the Old Testament books (apart from an Egyptian or Persian or Greek word here and there), namely, Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic, both of which belong to the great family of languages known as Semitic.I. The Semitic Languages.The languages spoken in Southwestern Asia during the historical period dealt with in the Bible have been named Shemitic, after the son of Noah from whom the majority of peoples speaking these languages--Arabs, Hebrews, Arameans and Assyrians (Ge 10:21)--were descended. To show, however, that the description does not fit exactly the thing described--the Elamites and Lydians having probably not spoken a Shemitic language, and the Canaanites, including Phoenicians, with the colonists descended from those at Carthage and elsewhere in the Mediterranean coast lands, as well as the Abyssinians (Ethiopians), who did, being reckoned descendants of Ham (Ge 9:18; 10:6)--the word is now generally written &quot;Semitic,&quot; a term introduced by Eichhorn (1787). These languages were spoken from the Caspian Sea to the South of Arabia, and from the Mediterranean to the valley of the Tigris.1. Members of Semitic Family:The following list shows the chief members of this family:(1) South Semitic or Arabic:Including the language of the Sabean (Himyaritic) inscriptions, as well as Ge&#x27;ez or Ethiopic. Arabic is now spoken from the Caucasus to Zanzibar, and from the East Indies to the Atlantic.(2) Middle Semitic or Canaanitish:Including Hebrew, old and new, Phoenician, with Punic, and Moabite (language of MS).(3) North Semitic or Aramaic:Including(a) East Aramaic or Syrian (language of Syrian Christians), language of Babylonian Talmud, Mandean;(b) West or Palestinian Aramaic of the Targums, Palestinian Talmud (Gemara), Biblical Aramaic (&quot;Chaldee&quot;), Samaritan, language of Nabatean inscriptions.(4) East Semitic:Language of Assyria-Babylonian inscriptions.2.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">la-od-i-se&#x27;-a (Laodikia): A city of Asia Minor situated in the Lycos valley in the province of Phrygia, and the home of one of the Seven Churches of Re (1:11). Distinguished from several other cities of that name by the appellation Ad Lycum, it was founded by Antiochus II (261-246 BC) of Syria, who named it for his wife Laodike, and who populated it with Syrians and with Jews who were transplanted from Babylonia to the cities of Phrygia and Lydia. Though Laodicea stood on the great highway at the junction of several important routes, it was a place of little consequence until the Roman province of Asia was formed in 190 BC. It then suddenly became a great and wealthy center of industry, famous specially for the fine black wool of its sheep and for the Phrygian powder for the eyes, which was manufactured there (compare Re 3:18). In the vicinity was the temple of Men Karou and a renowned school of medicine. In the year 60 AD, the city was almost entirely destroyed by an earthquake, but so wealthy were its citizens that they rejected the proffered aid of Rome, and quickly rebuilt it at their own expense (compare Re 3:17). It was a city of great wealth, with extensive banking operations (compare Re 3:18). Little is known of the early history of Christianity there; Timothy, Mark and Epaphras (Col 1:7) seem to have been the first to introduce it. However, Laodicea was early the chief bishopric of Phrygia, and about 166 AD Sagaris, its bishop, was martyred. In 1071 the city was taken by the Seljuks; in 1119 it was recovered to the Christians by John Comnenus, and in the 13th century it fell finally into the hands of the Turks.The ruins, now called Eski Hissar, or old castle, lie near the modern Gonjelli on the railroad, and they have long served as a quarry to the builders of the neighboring town of Denizli. Among them nothing from before the Roman period has appeared. One of the two Roman theaters is remarkably well preserved, and there may still be seen the stadium, a colonnade, the aqueduct which brought the water across the valley to the city by an inverted siphon of stone pipes, a large necropolis, and the ruins of three early Christian churches.E.

REASON FOR SUCH AN EPISTLEPaul here writes to the Colossians, &quot;And when this epistle hath been read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye also read the epistle from Laodicea.&quot; What was or what is this epistle?I. Explanations of Paul&#x27;s Statement.The words used by the apostle may mean:(1) a letter written by the Laodiceans;(2) an epistle written by Paul from Laodicea;(3) an epistle written to the Laodiceans, and to be procured from them by the Colossians.1. Written by the Laodiceans?:The words may mean a letter written by the Laodiceans. But here it is sufficient to refer to the fact that Paul enjoins the Colossians to procure and to read &quot;the epistle from Laodicea.&quot; How could a command of this kind be given in reference to an epistle written by third parties? How could Paul know that a copy of it had been made by the Laodiceans before sending it off? How could he tell that the Laodiceans would be willing to give away a copy of it? The suppositions involved by this hypothesis are incredible. Besides, the context regards the Epistle to the Colossians, and &quot;that from Laodicea,&quot; as companion epistles, of which the two churches are to make an interchange, so that each church is directed to read both.2. Written by Paul from Laodicea?:Or, the words may refer to an epistle written by Paul from Laodicea. And it has been suggested that the epistle of which we are in search may be 1 Timothy, 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, or Galatians. But in the case of these epistles, the probability is that every one of them was written elsewhere than from Laodicea. At the time when Paul wrote to Colosse, he was a prisoner in Rome, and for this reason alone, it was impossible that he could, at any recent date, have written any epistle from Laodicea. But his own statement (Col 2:1) is that those in Laodicea had not seen his face in the flesh. As he had never been in Laodicea, he could, not have written any epistle from that city.3. An Epistle Addressed to the Laodiceans:A third possibility is a letter written:(1) not by Paul, but by some other person. But the whole tone of the passage does not favor this suggestion in the least;(2) by Paul, but that the epistle is lost; this is the ordinary interpretation;(3) the apocryphal Latin epistle. &quot;To the Laodiceans.&quot;This spurious epistle is a mere compilation clumsily put together; it has no marks of authenticity.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">The word is the translation of three different Hebrew expressions: cheq (Pr 16:33), beghedh (2Ki 4:39), and chotsen (Ne 5:13, besides chatsen, Ps 129:7). In all these passages the meaning is that of a part of oriental clothing, probably the folds of the garment covering the bosom or lap of a person. The flowing garments of Orientals invite the use of the same, on the part of speakers, in driving home certain truths enunciated by impressive gesticulation. Every reader of Roman history recalls the impressive incident of Quintus Fabius Maximus (Cunctator), who, in 219 BC, was ambassador of Rome to Carthage, and who, before the city council, holding the folds of his toga in the shape of a closed pouch, declared that he held enclosed in the same both peace and war, whichever the Carthaginians should desire to choose. When the Carthaginians clamored for war, he opened the folds of his garment and said: &quot;Then you shall have war!&quot; Very much like it, Nehemiah, when pleading for united efforts for the improvement of social order, addressed the priests of Jerusalem to get a pledge of their cooperation: &quot;Also I shook out my lap (chotsen), and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied&quot; (Ne 5:13).In English Versions of the Bible the verb &quot;to lap&quot; is found, which has no etymological connection with the above-mentioned nouns. It is in Hebrew laqaq and refers to the loud licking up of water by dogs (1Ki 21:19; 22:38 the King James Version), and in the story of Gideon&#x27;s battle against the Midianites, of his 300 warriors (Jud 7:5).H.

The Hebrew name is a feminine plural like Jeremoth (1Ch 7:8), Naboth (1Ki 21:1). The plural is probably intensive. Jewish interpreters have identified Lappidoth (&quot;flames&quot;) with Barak (&quot;lightning&quot;). Some have taken the words rendered &quot;wife of Lappidoth&quot; (&#x27;esheth lappidhoth) as a description of Deborah, and have translated them, &quot;woman of lights,&quot; i.e. maker of wicks for the sanctuary; or &quot;woman of flames,&quot; referring to her prophetic zeal.

Sources:Etymologists assign three probable sources of aselgeia, namely:(1) from a compound of the alpha privitive (negation) and Selge, a Pisidian city whose inhabitants according to Thayer (New Testament Lexicon) &quot;excelled in strictness of morals,&quot; but, according to Trench, a place whose people &quot;were infamous for their vices&quot;;(2) from a compound of &quot;a&quot; intense, and salagein, &quot;to raise a disturbance or noise&quot;;(3) from a compound of the alpha privitive a- and selgo, or thelgo, &quot;exciting disgust or displeasure.&quot; It evidently means conduct and character that is unbecoming, indecent, unrestrainedly shameless.2. As Used in the New Testament:Mark uses it in 7:22 with uncertainty as to the vice meant. Paul (2Co 12:21) classes it with uncleanness and fornication as sins to be repented of; also (Ga 5:19; compare The Wisdom of Solomon 14:26, &quot;wantonness&quot;) puts it in the same catalogue with other works of the flesh; and (Eph 4:19) he refers to some aged ones so covetous, that they made trade of themselves by giving &quot;themselves up to lasciviousness.&quot; The same word is translated &quot;wantonness&quot; in Ro 13:13, meaning wanton manner, filthy words, unchaste movements of the body. Peter (1Pe 4:3) mentions those who &quot;walked in lasciviousness, lusts, winebibbings, revellings, carousings, and abominable idolatries.&quot; He speaks (2Pe 2:2) of &quot;lascivious doings&quot; (the King James Version &quot;pernicious ways&quot;); (2Pe 2:7) &quot;lascivious life&quot; (the King James Version &quot;filthy conversation&quot;); and (2Pe 2:18) of &quot;lasciviousness&quot; (the King James Version &quot;wantonness&quot;), as a means &quot;to entice in the lusts of the flesh.&quot; Jude 1:4 probably does not refer to any form of sensuality in using the word descriptive of &quot;ungodly men&quot; who perverted the faith of some and denied our only Master.William Edward Raffety</p>

Eusebius, Onomasticon identifies it with the hot springs at Callirrhoe in Wady Zerqa Ma`in, on the East of the Dead Sea; in this agreeing with Targum Jerusalem. This position, however, seems too far to the North, and possibly the site should be sought on the West of the Arabah. The absence of the article (compare Jos 15:2) prevents identification with the promontory el-Lisan, which runs into the sea from the eastern shore. Wellhausen (Comp. des Hexateuch., 15) thinks we should read lesham, since the Hebrew letters, &quot;m&quot; (mem) and &quot; ` &quot; (`ayin), are like each other in their Palmyrene form. We should then have indicated the boundary from Gaza to the Dead Sea, and then from the Dead Sea to Leshem, i.e. Dan. This is very precarious. No identification is possible.W. Ewing</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(kairos eschatos, chronos eschatos (also plural), eschaton tou chronou, hora eschate): In the King James Version this phrase occurs in 1Pe 1:5; 1:20 (plural); 1 Joh 2:18; Jude 1:18. The Revised Version (British and American) has, in 1Pe 1:20, &quot;at the end of the times,&quot; and in 1 Joh 2:18, &quot;the last hour,&quot; in closer adherence to the Greek. The conception is closely allied to that of &quot;the last day,&quot; and, like this, has its root in the Old Testament conception of &quot;the end of days.&quot; In the Old Testament this designates the entire eschatological period as that which the present course of the world is to issue into, and not, as might be assumed, the closing section of history. It is equivalent to what was later called &quot;the coming aeon&quot; (see ESCHATOLOGY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT). In the New Testament, on the other hand, the phrase &quot;the last time&quot; does mark the concluding section of the present world-period, of the present aeon. In three of the New Testament passages the consciousness expresses itself that these &quot;last times&quot; have arrived, and that the period extending from the appearance or the resurrection of Christ until His Second Coming is the closing part of the present age, that the writer and readers are living in &quot;the last times.&quot; In one passage (1Pe 1:5) &quot;the last time&quot; is projected farther forward into the future, so that it comes to mean the time immediately preceding the reappearance of Christ. Both usages can be readily explained. The days of the Messiah were to the Old Testament writers part of the future world, although to the later Jewish chiliasm they appeared as lying this side of it, because differing from the world to come in their earthly and temporal character. To the early Christians the days of the Messiah appeared more closely assimilated in character to the future world, so that no reason existed on this score for not including them in the latter. Still it was also realized that the Messiah in His first appearance had not brought the full realization of the coming world, and that only His return from heaven would consummate the kingdom of God. Accordingly, the days in which they lived assumed to them the character of an intermediate period, marked off on the one hand from the previous development by the appearance of the Messiah, but equally marked off from the coming eon by His reappearance in glory. From a formal point of view the representation resembles the Jewish chiliastic scheme, but with a twofold substantial difference:(a) the chiliastic scheme restricts the Messiah and His work to the last days, and does not carry Him over into the coming world, whereas to the Christian the coming world, no less than the last days, is thoroughly Messianic;(b) to the Jewish point of view both the days of the Messiah and the coming world lie in the future, whereas to the Christian the former have already arrived.It remained possible, however, from the Christian point of view to distinguish within the last times themselves between the immediat...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">lat&#x27;-in: Was the official language of the Roman Empire as Greek was that of commerce. In Palestine Aramaic was the vernacular in the rural districts and remoter towns, while in the leading towns both Greek and Aramaic were spoken. These facts furnish the explanation of the use of all three tongues in the inscription on the cross of Christ (Mt 27:37; Mr 15:26; Lu 23:38; Joh 19:19). Thus the charge was written in the legal language, and was technically regular as well as recognizable by all classes of the people. The term &quot;Latin&quot; occurs in the New Testament only in Joh 19:20, Rhomaisti, and in Lu 23:38, Rhomaikois (grammasin), according to Codices Sinaiticus, A, D, and N. It is probable that Tertullus made his plea against Paul before Felix (Ac 24) in Latin, though Greek was allowed in such provincial courts by grace of the judge. It is probable also that Paul knew and spoke Latin; compare W.M. Ramsay, Pauline and Other Studies, 1906, 65, and A. Souter, &quot;Did Paul Speak Latin?&quot; The Expositor, April, 1911. The vernacular Latin had its own history and development with great influence on the ecclesiastical terminology of the West. See W. Bury, &quot;The Holy Latin Tongue,&quot; Dublin Review, April, 1906, and Ronsch, Itala und Vulgata, 1874, 480 f. There is no doubt of the mutual influence of Greek and Latin on each other in the later centuries. See W. Schulze, Graeca Latina, 1891; Viereck, Sermo Graecus, 1888.It is doubtful if the Latin syntax is clearly perceptible in the koine (see LANGUAGE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT).Deissmann (Light from the Ancient East, 117 f) finds ergasian didomi (operam dare) in an xyrhynchus papyrus letter of the vulgar type from 2nd century BC (compare Lu 12:58). A lead tablet in Amorgus has krino to dikaion (compare Lu 12:57). The papyri (2nd century AD) give sunairo logon (compare Mt 18:23 f). Moulton (Expositor, February, 1903, 115) shows that to hikanon poiein (satisfacere), is as old as Polybius. Even sumbouilion lambanien (concilium capere), may go with the rest like su opes (Mt 27:4), for videris (Thayer). Moulton (Prol., 21) and Thumb (Griechische Sprache, 121) consider the whole matter of syntactical Latinisms in the New Testament inconclusive. But see also C.

The Motive of Translation:The claim of Christianity to be the one true religion has carried with it from the beginning the obligation to make its Holy Scriptures, containing the Divine message of salvation and life eternal, known to all mankind. Accordingly, wherever the first Christian evangelists carried the gospel beyond the limits of the Greek-speaking world, one of the first requirements of their work was to give the newly evangelized peoples the record of God&#x27;s revelation of Himself in their mother tongue. It was through the Septuagint translation of the Old Testament that the great truths of revelation first became known to the Greek and Roman world. It is generally agreed that, as Christianity spread, the Syriac and the Latin versions were the first to be produced; and translations of the Gospels, and of other books of the Old and New Testament in Greek, were in all probability to be found in these languages before the close of the 2nd century.2. Multiplicity of Latin Translations in the 4th Century:Of the earliest translators of the Bible into Latin no record has survived. Notwithstanding the careful investigations of scholars in recent years, there are still many questions relating to the origin of the Latin Bible to which only tentative and provisional answers can be given. It is therefore more convenient to begin a study of its history with Jerome toward the close of the 4th century and the commission entrusted to him by Pope Damasus to produce a standard Latin version, the execution of which gave to Christendom the Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) (see VULGATE). The need for such a version was clamant. There existed by this time a multiplicity of translations differing from one another, and there was none possessed of commanding authority to which appeal might be made in case of necessity. It was the consideration of the chaotic condition of the existing translations, with their divergences and variations, which moved Damasus to commission Jerome to his task and Jerome to undertake it. We learn particulars from the letter of Jerome in 383 transmitting to his patron the first installment of his revision, the Gospels. &quot;Thou compellest me,&quot; he writes, &quot;to make a new work out of an old so that after so many copies of the Scriptures have been dispersed throughout the whole world I am as it were to occupy the post of arbiter, and seeing they differ from one another am to determine which of them are in agreement with the original Greek.&quot; Anticipating attacks from critics, he says, further: &quot;If they maintain that confidence is to be reposed in the Latin exemplars, let them answer wh...</p>

In the same verse for &quot;God hath made me to laugh,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) gives in margin, &quot;hath prepared laughter for me,&quot; and this gave his name to the son, the promise of whose birth evoked the laughter (Yitschaq, Isaac); gelao (Lu 6:21,25) has the same meaning of gladness and rejoicing; sechoq, &quot;laughter,&quot; has also this sense (Job 8:21; Ps 126:2). It is, however, &quot;laughed to scorn&quot; in Job 12:4; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;laughing-stock&quot;; so Jer 20:7; compare 48:26,27,39; La 3:14, &quot;derision.&quot;(2) Sachaq is used (except Job 29:24; Ec 3:4) in the sense of the laughter of defiance, or derision (Job 5:22; 41:29); in Piel it is often translated &quot;play,&quot; &quot;playing,&quot; &quot;merry&quot;(3) La`agh is &quot;to scorn&quot; &quot;to laugh to scorn&quot; (2Ki 19:21; Ne 2:19); sachaq has also this sense (2Ch 30:10); tsechoq (Eze 23:32); sechoq (Job 12:4); katagelao (Mt 9:24; Mr 5:40; Lu 8:53); the simple gelao occurs only in Lu 6:21,25; see above. Katagelao is found in Judith 12:12, &quot;laugh to scorn&quot; (Ecclesiasticus 7:11; 20:17; 1 Macc 10:70, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;derision&quot;).For &quot;laugh&quot; (Job 9:23) the Revised Version (British and American) has &quot;mock&quot;; for &quot;mocked of his neighbor&quot; and &quot;laughed to scorn&quot; (Job 12:4) &quot;laughing-stock&quot;; for &quot;shall rejoice in time to come&quot; (Pr 31:25), &quot;laugheth at the time to come&quot;; &quot;laughter&quot; for &quot;laughing&quot; (Job 8:21).W.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">la&#x27;-ver (kiyor):1. In the Tabernacle:Every priest in attendance on the altar of Yahweh was required to wash his hands and his feet before entering upon his official duties (Ex 30:19). To this end a laver was ordered to be made as part of the tabernacle equipment (Ex 30:17-21; 38:8). Its composition was of brass (bronze), and it consisted of two parts, the bowl and its pedestal or foot (Ex 30:18, etc.). This first laver was a small one, and was made of the hand mirrors of the women in attendance upon the altar (Ex 38:8). Its place was between the altar and the tabernacle (Ex 40:30).See TABERNACLE.2. In the Temple:The difficulty as to the washing of parts of the sacrificial carcasses was overcome, in the temple of Solomon, by the construction of &quot;10 lavers&quot; and a &quot;molten sea&quot; (1Ki 7:23-37; 2Ch 4:2-6; see TEMPLE; SEA, THE MOLTEN). We learn from 2Ch 4:6 that the &quot;sea&quot; was for the priests to wash in--therefore took the place of the laver in the tabernacle--and the lavers were used as baths for portions of the burnt offerings. The lavers themselves were artistic works of unusual merit for that age. Like that in the tabernacle, each had its own stand or base, which was cast in a separate piece from the laver. These bases rested on wheels which allowed of the laver being moved from one part of the court to another without being turned about. Five stood on the north and five on the south side of the temple. They were ornamented with &quot;lions, oxen, and cherubim,&quot; and on a lower level, with a series of wreaths or festoons of flowers (1Ki 7:27-37). In modern speech, the lavers may be described as so many circular open tanks for the storage of water. Each laver contained 40 baths (about 320 gals.) of water. Its height was 5 cubits, the locomotive machinery being 3 cubits in height, and the depth of the bowl or tank, judging from its capacity, about 2 cubits. The last we hear of the lavers, apart from their bases, is that the idolatrous king Ahaz cut off the border of the bases, and removed the bases from them (2Ki 16:17). During the reign of Jehoiakim, Jeremiah foretold that the molten sea and the bases (there being then no lavers) should be carried to Babylon (Jer 27:19). A few years later it is recorded that the bases were broken up, and the brass of which they were made was carried away (Jer 52:17).3. The Laver in the New Testament:The Greek word (loutron) occurs twice in the New Testament. In Eph 5:26, Paul says that Christ gave Himself for the church &quot;that he might sanctify it having cleansed it by the washing (Greek &quot;laver&quot;) of water with the word&quot;; and in Tit 3:5 he says that we are saved &quot;through the washing (Greek &quot;laver&quot;) of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.&quot; In these passages the reference is to the constant physical purity demanded of the Jewish priests when in attendance upon the temple. Christians are &quot;a holy priesthood,&quot; and are cleansed not by water only, but, in the former passage, &quot;with the word&quot; (compare Joh 15:3); in the latter,...</p>

In the Epistle to the Hebrews5. In the Epistle of James6. In the Epistles of Peter and JohnLITERATUREThe Term &quot;Law&quot;:The Greek word for &quot;law&quot; is nomos, derived from nemo, &quot;to divide,&quot; &quot;distribute,&quot; &quot;apportion,&quot; and generally meant anything established, anything received by usage, a custom, usage, law; in the New Testament a command, law.Austin&#x27;s Definition of Law:It may not be amiss to note the definition of law given by a celebrated authority in jurisprudence, the late Mr. John Austin: &quot;A law, in the most general and comprehensive acceptation in which the term, in its literal meaning, is employed, may be said to be a rule laid down for the guidance of an intelligent being, by an intelligent being having power over him.&quot; Under this comprehensive statement, he classifies &quot;laws set by God to His human creatures, and laws set by men to men.&quot; After analyzing the three ideas, command as the expression of a particular desire; duty or obligation, signifying that one is bound or obliged by the command to pursue a certain course of conduct, and sanction, indicating the evil likely to be incurred by disobedience, he thus summarizes: &quot;The ideas or notions comprehended by the term command are the following:(1) a wish or desire conceived by a rational being that another rational being shall do or forbear;(2) an evil to proceed from the former and to be incurred by the latter in case the latter comply not with the wish;(3) an expression or intimation of the wish by words or other signs.&quot;This definition makes it clear that the term &quot;laws of nature&quot; can be used only in a metaphorical sense, the metaphorical application being suggested as Austin shows by the fact that uniformity or stability of conduct is one of the ordinary consequences of a law proper, consequently, &quot;Wherever we observe a uniform order of events, or a uniform order of coexisting phenomena, we are prone to impute that order to a law set by its author, though the case presents us with nothing that can be likened to a sanction or a duty.&quot; A...</p>

THE PASSING AWAY OF THE LAWLITERATURELaw, at least as custom, certainly existed among the Hebrews in the times before Moses, as appears from numerous allusions to it, both in matters civil and ceremonial, in the earlier Scriptures. But we have no distinct account of such law, either as to its full contents or its enactment. Law in the Old Testament practically means the Law promulgated by Moses (having its roots no doubt in this earlier law or custom), with sundry later modifications or additions, rules as to which have been inserted in the record of the Mosaic law.The following are matters of pre-Mosaic law or custom to which allusion is made in Genesis and Exodus: the offering of sacrifice and the use of altars (Genesis, passim); the religious use of pillars (Ge 28:18); purification for sacrifice (Ge 35:2); tithes (Ge 14:20; 28:22); circumcision (Ge 17:10; Ex 4:25 f); inquiry at a sanctuary (Ge 25:22); sacred feasts (Ex 5:1, etc.); priests (Ex 19:22); sacred oaths (Ge 14:22); marriage customs (Ge 16; 24; 25:6; 29:16-30); birthright (Ge 25:31-34); elders (Ge 24:2; 50:7; Ex 3:16); homicide (Ge 9:6), etc. We proceed at once to the Law of Moses.I. Terms Used.The Hebrew word rendered &quot;law&quot; in our Bibles is torah. Other synonymous words either denote (as indeed does torah itself) aspects under which the Law may be regarded, or different classes of law.1. Torah (&quot;Law&quot;):Torah is from horah, the Hiphil of yarah. The root meaning is &quot;to throw&quot;; hence, in Hiphil the word means &quot;to point out&quot; (as by throwing out the hand), and so &quot;to direct&quot;; and torah is &quot;direction.&quot; Torah may be simply &quot;human direction,&quot; as the &quot;law of thy mother&quot; in Pr 1:8; but most often in the Old Testament it is the Divine law. In the singular it often means a law, the plural being used in the same sense; but more frequently torah in the singular is the general body of Divinely given law. The word tells nothing as to the way in which the Law, or any part of it, was first given; it simply points out the general purpose of the Law, namely, that it was for the guidance of God&#x27;s people in the various matters to which it relates. This shows that the end of the Law lay beyond the mere obedience to such and such rules, that end being instruction in the knowledge of God...</p>

The position of Yahweh, as the Supreme Ruler, was made legally binding by a formal election on the part of the national assembly (Ex 19:3-8); and that there might be no question about the matter, after the death of Moses, Joshua, in accordance with instructions received by his great predecessor in the office of federal judge, in the public assembly caused the contract to be renewed in connection with most solemn exercises (Jos 8:30-35). No legal contract was ever entered into with more formality and with a clearer understanding of the terms by the several parties than was the contract which made it binding on the Hebrews permanently to recognize Yahweh as the Supreme Ruler (Ex 24:3-8). He was to be acknowledged as the Founder of the nation (Ex 20:2); Sovereign, Ruler, and Judge (Ex 20:2-6); and in these capacities was to be the object of love, reverential fear and worship, service, and absolute obedience. Flagrant disregard of their obligations to Him manifested in idolatry or blasphemy was regarded as high treason, and like high treason in all nations and history was punishable by death (Ex 20:3-5,7; 22:20; Le 24:16; De 17:2-5). The will of Yahweh in critical cases was to be ascertained through special means (Nu 9:8; Jud 1:1,2; 20:18,23,28; 1Sa 10:22).The ruling official recognized by the Hebrews as a nation was the chief magistrate, but he stood as Yahweh&#x27;s vicegerent, and therefore combined various authorities in his person. We must distinguish the functions of the chief magistrate (1) under the republic, (2) under the constitutional monarchy, and (3) under the senatorial oligarchy after the Babylonian captivity. Moses was the first chief magistrate under the republic; after him, Joshua, and the other judges. Under the constitutional monarchy, it was the king whose government was limited, for he was to be elected by the people; must be a native Hebrew; must not keep a large cavalry; must not support a harem; must not multiply riches; must be a defender of the national religion; must be guided by law, not whim; must be gracious and condescending to the people (De 17:15-20). After the Babylonian captivity, the senatorial oligarchy combined ecclesiastical and state authority, later sharing it with the Roman government.See also SANHEDRIN.Frank E. Hirsch</p>

It is used of things when the same are in accord with a pronounced judgment or a declared will of God, and thus pleasing in His sight (Mr 3:4). When the course of individual conduct is according to God&#x27;s law of righteousness, it is declared to be &quot;lawful&quot; (Eze 33:19). The word is used in a forensic sense as declaring the legal status of a person conforming to law. The idea of straighthess, rigid adherence to God&#x27;s law, whether religious, civil or ceremonial, cannot be excluded from the definition of the word &quot;lawful.&quot;Neither the King James Version nor the American Standard Revised Version is consistent in its translation of the Hebrew and Greek words translated &quot;lawful.&quot; Ofttimes the words &quot;just&quot; and &quot;righteous&quot; are used. To arrive at the full and proper meaning of &quot;lawful,&quot; therefore, it is necessary that we study the passages containing these synonymous terms.

In the Revised Version (British and American) it bears the translation &quot;lawgiver&quot; but twice (De 33:21; Isa 33:22), though in the other passages (Ge 49:10; Nu 21:18; Jud 5:14; Ps 60:7; 108:8) this meaning is retained in the margin. The Greek word occurs in the New Testament but once (Jas 4:12), where it has a meaning that is almost the exact equivalent of the Hebrew word in Isa 33:22. In both passages God is declared to be the &quot;lawgiver,&quot; and in the New Testament passage is so called because He has the power to rule and judge, to save and destroy. Man is denied the authority to judge because he is not the lawgiver. God is the lawgiver, and therefore possesses the right to pronounce judgment (compare Isa, supra). The word, however, implies more than mere legislative function; it also connotes the idea of ruling. Isaiah makes this very plain, since he adds to the statement that God is our judge and lawgiver the further declaration that He is also king. This meaning adheres in the very history of the word. It is based upon the monarchical conception in which the legislative, judicial and administrative functions are all vested in one person. In James the two terms &quot;lawgiver and judge&quot; express the idea of God&#x27;s absolute sovereignty. The verb nomothetein occurs in Heb 7:11; 8:6, but it does not extend beyond the meaning &quot;to enact laws.&quot;The Hebrew word is restricted to poetic passages, and except in Isa 33:22 is applied to a tribal or kingly ruler. Moses is pre-eminently the lawgiver in Jewish and Christian circles, but it should be noted that in the Scriptures of neither is he given this title. The primary meaning of the verb from which mechoqeq is derived is &quot;to cut,&quot; &quot;to carve,&quot; and a derived meaning is &quot;to ordain.&quot; The meaning of the participle mechoqeq is based upon this last. It means(1) the symbol which expresses the lawmaker&#x27;s authority, that is, the commander&#x27;s staff; and(2) the person who possesses the authority (De 33:21).It has the first of these meanings in Nu 21:18; Ps 60:7; 108:8, and probably in Ge 49:10, though here it may have the second meaning. The parallelism, however, seems to require an impersonal object to correspond to scepter, and so the reading of the text (The Revised Version) is to be preferred to that of the margin (Skinner, at the place). In De 33:21; Jud 5:14; Isa 33:22, it means the person who wielded the symbol of authority, that is the prescriber of laws. In a primitive community this would be a military commander. In Ge 49:10 the &quot;ruler&#x27;s staff&quot; is the symbol of kingly authority (Driver), and this verse consequently implies the supremacy of Judah which came in with the Davidic kingdom. This word contains no reference to the Messiah. In Nu 21:18 there is an allusion to the custom ...</p>

When Paul claims to be &quot;without law,&quot; he has reference to those things in the ceremonial law which might well be passed over, and not to the moral law. Paul was by no means an antinomian. Those are &quot;lawless&quot; who break the law of the Decalogue; hence, those who disobey the commandment, &quot;Honor thy father and thy mother,&quot; are lawless (1Ti 1:9). The civil law is also the law of God. Those breaking it are lawless, hence, called &quot;transgressors.&quot; Those who are unjust in their dealings are also &quot;lawless&quot;; for this reason the hands of Pilate and those who with him unjustly condemned Jesus are called &quot;wicked (unlawful) hands&quot; (Ac 2:23 the King James Version).

Their business was threefold:(1) to study and interpret the law;(2) to instruct the Hebrew youth in the law;(3) to decide questions of the law. The first two they did as scholars and teachers, the last as advisers in some court.By virtue of the first-named function, they gradually developed a large amount of common law, for no code can go into such detail as to eliminate the necessity of subsequent legislation, and this usually, to a great extent, takes the form of judicial decisions founded on the code rather than of separate enactment. And so it was among the Hebrews. The provisions of their code were for the most part quite general, thus affording much scope for casuistic interpretation. As a result of the industry with which this line of legal development had been pursued during the centuries immediately preceding our era, the Hebrew law had become a very complicated science; and since it was forbidden to record these judicial decisions, a protracted study was necessary in order to commit them to memory.But since the law must have universal application, the views of the individual scribe could not be taken as a standard; hence, the several disciples of the law must frequently meet for discussion, and the opinion of the majority then prevailed. To these meetings the youth interested in the study would be invited, that they might memorize the formulas agreed upon and might clear up the points upon which they were uncertain by asking questions of the recognized doctors (Lu 2:46).Such centers of legal lore, of course, would seldom be found in rural communities; the authorities would naturally gather in large centers of population, especially--until 70 AD--in Jerusalem. While the deliverances of these law schools were purely theoretical, yet they stood in close relation to the practical. Whenever doubt arose regarding the application of the law to a particular case, the question was referred to the nearest lawyer; by him to the nearest company of lawyers, perhaps to the Sanhedrin; and the resultant decision was henceforth authority. Thus the lawyers became law makers, and after the destruction of Jerusalem, which brought an end to the existence of the Sanhedrin, the rabbinical doctors were recognized as the absolute authority in such matters. Frequently a single lawyer of great rank, as for instance Hillel or Gamaliel I, might pronounce dicta of unquestioned recognition with as much authority as a supreme court in our day, though sometimes his opinions were received and corrected by the legal tribunal, especially the Sanhedrin. Of course, frequently, these tribunals were under the sway of such a man&#x27;s influence, so that what he...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">laz&#x27;-a-rus (Lazaros, an abridged form of the Hebrew name Eleazar, with a Greek termination): Means &quot;God has helped.&quot; In Septuagint and Josephus are found the forms Eleazar, and Eleazaros. The name was common among the Jews, and is given to two men in the New Testament who have nothing to do with each other.1. Lazarus of Bethany:The home of the Lazarus mentioned in Joh 11:1 was Bethany. He was the brother of Martha and Mary (Joh 11:1,2; see also Lu 10:38-41). All three were especially beloved by Jesus (Joh 11:5), and at their home He more than once, and probably often, was entertained (Lu 10:38-41; Joh 11). As intimated by the number of condoling friends from the city, and perhaps from the costly ointment used by Mary, the family was probably well-to-do. In the absence of Jesus, Lazarus was taken sick, died, and was buried, but, after having lain in the grave four days, was brought back to life by the Saviour (Joh 11:3,14,17,43,44). As a result many Jews believed on Jesus, but others went and told the Pharisees, and a council was therefore called to hasten the decree of the Master&#x27;s death (Joh 11:45-53). Later, six days before the Passover, at a feast in some home in Bethany where Martha served, Lazarus sat at table as one of the guests, when his sister Mary anointed the feet of Jesus (Joh 12:1-3). Many of the common people came thither, not only to see Jesus, but also the risen Lazarus, believed in Jesus, and were enthusiastic in witnessing for Him during the triumphal entry, and attracted others from the city to meet Him (Joh 12:9,11,17,18). For that reason the priests plotted to murder Lazarus (Joh 12:10). This is all that we really know about the man, for whether the Jews accomplished his death we are not informed, but it seems probable that, satiated with the death of Jesus, they left Lazarus unmolested. Nothing is told of his experiences between death and resurrection (compare Tennyson, &quot;In Memoriam,&quot; xxxi), of his emotions upon coming out of the tomb, of his subsequent life (compare Browning, &quot;A Letter to Karshish&quot;), and not a word of revelation does he give as to the other world. His resurrection has been a favorite subject for various forms of Christian art, and according to an old tradition of Epiphanius he was 30 years old when he was raised from the dead, and lived 30 years thereafter.As might be expected this miracle has been vigorously assailed by all schools of hostile critics. Ingenuity has been exhausted in inventing objections to it. But all told, they really amount only to three.(1) The Silence of the Other Gospels.There is here, no doubt, some difficulty. But the desire of the early Christians, as many scholars think, to screen the family from danger may have kept the story from becoming current in the oral tradition whence the Synoptics drew their materials, though Matthew was probably an eyewitness. But, in any case, the Synoptics do not pretend to give all the deeds of Jesus, and in the report by them we have few save those ...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">led (`ophereth): Lead was one of the first metals to be used in the free state, probably because it was so easily obtained from its ores. Lead was found in ancient times in Egypt and the Sinaitic peninsula. There is no lead found in Palestine proper, but in Northern Syria and Asia Minor it occurs in considerable quantities, usually associated with silver. These sources no doubt furnished an important supply in Bible times. It was also brought by the Phoenicians from Spain (Tarshish) (Eze 27:12) and the British Isles.Lead was used, as it still is, all along the Mediterranean shores for sinkers. Pieces of Egyptian fishnets probably dating from 1200 BC are now preserved in the British Museum, with their lead sinkers still attached. Since lead was the heaviest metal known to the ancients, gold excepted, it was generally used for fish-lines and sounding lines (compare Ac 27:28), especially in the dense waters of the Mediterranean. Moses mentioned the sinking qualities of lead in the sea in his simile of the sinking of Pharaoh&#x27;s hosts &quot;as lead in the mighty waters&quot; (Ex 15:10).Lead was used by the ancients for binding stones together. In most of the ancient ruins of Syria the Arabs have dug holes at the seams between stones in walls and columns in order to remove the iron, bronze, or lead thus used. In the museum of the Syrian Protestant College, Beirut, there are several specimens of cast-lead sarcophagi dating from the time of Christ.In Job 19:23,14, lead is mentioned as used in the engraving of permanent records. Two inferences might he drawn from this passage: either that the letters were cut with a chisel (pen) and then the cutting was filled with lead, or that sheets of lead were used as tablets on which to grave the record with an iron tool. Lead is frequently referred to along with iron, brass, silver and tin (Nu 31:22; Eze 22:18,20; 27:12). The use of lead for plumblines is implied in Am 7:7,8; Zec 4:10; as a weight in Zec 5:7,8. That Old Testament writers understood the use of lead for purifying gold is shown by Jer 6:29 and Eze 22:18-22 (compare Mal 3:2,3).See METALS; REFINER.James A. Patch</p>

We are told that her eyes were &quot;tender&quot; rakkoth). Gesenius renders it &quot;weak,&quot; Septuagint astheneis; accordingly, she was weak-eyed, but by no means &quot;blear-eyed&quot; (compare Vulgate). Her eyes were lacking that luster which always and everywhere is looked upon as a conspicuous part of female beauty. Josephus (Ant., I, xix, 7) says of her, ten opsin ouk euprepe, which may safely be rendered, &quot;she was of no comely countenance.&quot;Leah became the wife of Jacob by a ruse on the part of her father, taking advantage of the oriental custom of heavily veiling the prospective bride. When taken to task by his irate son-in-law, Laban excused himself by stating it was against the rule of the place &quot;to give the younger before the first-born&quot; (Ge 29:21-26). Although Rachel was plainly preferred by Jacob to Leah, still the latter bore him six sons: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah (Ge 29:31), Issachar, Zebulun, and a daughter, Dinah (Ge 30:17-21). Up to this time Rachel had not been blessed with children of her own. Thus the lesson is brought home to us that Yahweh has a special and kindly regard for the lowly and despised, provided they learn, through their troubles and afflictions, to look to Him for help and success. It seems that homely Leah was a person of deep-rooted piety and therefore better suited to become instrumental in carrying out the plans of Yahweh than her handsome, but worldly-minded, sister Rachel.When Jacob decided to return to the &quot;land of his fathers,&quot; both of his wives were ready to accompany him (Ge 31:4,14). Before they reached the end of their journey their courage was sorely tried at the time of the meeting between Jacob and his brother Esau. Although Leah was placed between the handmaids in the front, and Rachel with her son Joseph in the rear, she still cannot have derived much comfort from her position. We may well imagine her feeling of relief when she saw Esau and his 400 men returning to Seir (Ge 33:2,16).According to Ge 49:31, Leah was buried at Machpelah. We cannot know for a certainty that she died before Jacob&#x27;s going down to Egypt, though it is very likely. If she went down with her husband and died in Egypt, he had her body sent to the family burying-place. Ru 4:11 discloses the fact that her memory was not forgotten by future generations. When Boaz took Ru for a wife the witnesses exclaimed, &quot;Yahweh make the woman that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel.&quot;William Baur</p>

The &quot;leaven&quot; consisted always, so far as the evidence goes, of a piece of fermented dough kept over from a former baking. There is no trace of the use of other sorts of leaven, such as the lees of wine or those mentioned by Pliny (NH, xviii.26). The lump of dough thus preserved was either dissolved in water in the kneading-trough before the flour was added, or was &quot;hid&quot; in the flour (the King James Version &quot;meal&quot;) and kneaded along with it, as was the case mentioned in the parable (Mt 13:33). The bread thus made was known as &quot;leavened,&quot; as distinguished from &quot;unleavened&quot; bread (Ex 12:15, etc.).See BREAD.(2) In Law and Ritual.The ritual prohibition of leaven during &quot;the feast of unleavened bread&quot; including the Passover (Ex 23:15, etc.) is a matter inviting restudy. For the historical explanation given in the Scriptures, see especially Ex 12:34-39; 13:3 ff; De 16:3. The antiquity of the prohibition is witnessed by its occurrence in the earliest legislation (Ex 23:18; 34:25). A natural reason for the prohibition, like that of the similar exclusion of honey, is sought on the ground that fermentation implied a process of corruption. Plutarch voices this ancient view of the matter when he speaks of it as &quot;itself the offspring of corruption, and corrupting the mass of dough with which it is mixed.&quot; Fermentatum is used in Persius (Sat., i.24) for &quot;corruption.&quot; For this reason doubtless it was excluded also from the offerings placed upon the altar of Yahweh, cakes made from flour without leaven, and these only, being allowed. The regulation name for these &quot;unleavened cakes&quot; was matstsoth (Le 10:12). Two exceptions to this rule should be noted (Le 7:13; compare Am 4:5): &quot;leavened bread&quot; was an accompaniment of the thank offering as leavened loaves were used also in the wave offering of Le 23:17. Rabbinical writers regularly use leaven as a symbol of evil (Lightfoot).(3) In Teaching.The figurative uses of leaven in the New Testament, no less than with the rabbins, reflect the ancient view of it as &quot;corrupt and corrupting,&quot; in parts at least, e.g. Mt 16:6 parallel, and especially the proverbial saying twice quoted by Paul, &quot;A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump&quot; (1Co 5:6 f; Ga 5:9). But as Jesus used it in Mt 13:33, &quot;The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven,&quot; it is clearly the hidden, silent, mysterious but all-pervading and transforming action of the leaven in the measures of flour that is the point of the comparison.LITERATURE.Nowack, Hebrew Arch., II, 145 f; Talmud, Berakhoth, 17a; Lightfoot, ...</p>

Name:Derived from the root labhen, &quot;to be white,&quot; probably from the snow which covers its summits the greater part of the year. &quot;White mountains&quot; are found in almost every country. The light color of the upper limestone may, however, form a sufficient reason for the name. In prose the article is usually connected with the name. In poetry it is more often without the article. In the Septuagint, however, the article is generally present both in prose and poetry.2. General Description:The Lebanon range proper borders the east coast of the Mediterranean, for a distance of 100 miles, running North-Northeast and South-Southwest from the mouth of the Litany river, the classic Leontes (which enters the sea a little North of Tyre), to the mouth of the Eleuthurus (Nahr el-Kebir), a few miles North of Tripolis. This river comes through a depression between Lebanon and the Nuseiriyeh mountains, known as &quot;the entrance to Hamath,&quot; and connects with a caravan route to the Euphrates through Palmyra. For a considerable distance North of the Litany, the mountain summits average from 4,000 to 6,000 ft. in height, and the range is more or less dissected by short streams which enter the Mediterranean. Most prominent of these is the Nahr ez-Zaherany, which, after running 25 or 30 miles in a southerly direction through the center of the range, like the Litany, turns abruptly West opposite Mt. Hermon, reaching the sea between Tyre and Sidon. In roughly parallel courses Nahr el-`Awleh and Nahr Damur descend to the sea between Sidon and Beyrout, and Nahr Beyrout just North of the city. Throughout this district the mountain recesses are more or less wooded. Opposite Beyrout the range rises in Jebel Sannin to an elevation of 8,560 ft. Thirty miles farther Northeast the summit is reached in Jebel Mukhmal, at an elevation of 10,225 ft., with several others of nearly the same height. An amphitheater here opens to the West, in which is sheltered the most frequented cedar grove, and from which emerges the Nahr Qadisha (&quot;sacred stream&quot;) which enters the Mediterranean at Tripolis. Snow is found upon these summits throughout the year (Jer 18:14), while formerly the level area between them furnished the snow fields from which a glacier descended several miles into the headwaters of the Qadisha, reaching a level of about 5,000 ft. The glacier deposited in this amphitheater a terminal moraine covering several square miles, which at its front, near Bsherreh, is 1,000 ft. in thickness. It is on this that the grove of cedars referred to is growing.The view from this summit reveals the geographical features of the region in a most satisfactory manner. Toward the East lies Coele-Syria (the modern Buka), 7,000 ft. below the summit, bordered on the eastern side by the mountain wall of Anti-Lebanon, corresponding to the cliffs of Moab East of the Jordan valley, opposite Judea.

Frequently in Hebrew idiom the right hand and the left are mentioned together in order to express the idea &quot;everywhere,&quot; &quot;anywhere,&quot; &quot;altogether&quot; (Ge 24:49; Ex 14:22,29; Nu 22:26; De 2:27; 5:32; 2Co 6:7). In the geographical sense the left is synonymous with north (Ge 14:15; Jos 19:27; Eze 16:46; Ac 21:3). While the left hand is considered as weaker than the right (see LEFTHANDED), it is the hand which holds the bow (Eze 39:3). The left hand is the side from which bad omens come, and therefore less lucky and less honored than the right hand (see HAND, note).H. L. E. Luering</p>

It is interesting to note that in both instances, where the expression occurs in the Scripture, it refers to individuals belonging to the tribe of Benjamin (which name itself signifies &quot;a son of the right hand&quot;!). The first is Ehud, son of Gera, who killed Eglon, king of Moab, and thereby delivered Israel from paying tribute to the Moabites (Jud 3:15). The other instance is that of the 700 selected Benjamites, who, though lefthanded, &quot;could sling stones at a hair-breadth, and not miss&quot; (Jud 20:16; of 1Ch 12:2).H. L. E. Luering</p>

It expresses metaphorically the muscular strength, and the pride of the runner. &quot;He taketh no pleasure in the legs of a man&quot; (Ps 147:10). &quot;His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold&quot; (So 5:15). If the legs have lost their strength as in the lame or the Beri-beri patient, they become a metaphor for anything useless, inefficient or disappointing: &quot;The legs of the lame hang loose; so is a parable in the mouth of fools&quot; (Pr 26:7). The Aramaic form is found in the description of the image of Nebuchadnezzar, &quot;its legs of iron&quot; (Da 2:33).(2) Kara`, dual kera`ayim, the &quot;leg,&quot; &quot;respecting the legs,&quot; mentioned as a portion of the paschal lamb (Ex 12:9), or, usually, in connection with the head and the inwards, as a sacrificial portion (Ex 29:17; Le 1:9,13; Am 3:12). The word designates also the legs of leaping insects of the orthopterous family, locusts, etc., which were permitted as food to the Israelites (Le 11:21). (3) Reghel, literally, &quot;foot&quot; (which see), found in this sense only once: &quot;He (Goliath) had greaves of brass upon his legs&quot; (1Sa 17:6).Two passages of wrong translation in the King James Version have been corrected by the Revised Version (British and American). The virgin daughter of Babylon is addressed: &quot;Make bare the leg, uncover the thigh&quot; (Isa 47:2), the Revised Version (British and American) renders: &quot;Strip off the train (shobhel), uncover the leg,&quot; the idea being that the gentle maid, who has been brought up in affluence and luxury, will have to don the attire of a slave girl and do menial work, for which her former garments are unsuited. The other passage is in Isa 3:20, where the King James Version reads: &quot;the bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) corrects: &quot;the headtires (ts`adhah), and the ankle chains.&quot;In the New Testament the word &quot;leg&quot; is found only in connection with the breaking of the legs of the persons crucified with the Saviour (Joh 19:31,32,33). We know from Roman and Greek authors that this was done as a coup de grace to shorten the miseries of criminals condemned to die on the cross. The practice bore the technical name of skelokopia, Latin crurifragium. The verb skelokopein (&quot;to break the legs&quot;), is found in the apocryphal Gospel of Peter (1Pe 4:14), where it is distinctly stated that the legs of Jesus were not broken, that His sufferings on the cross might be extended, while the two malefactors crucified with Him were mercifully dispatched in this way. The crurifragium consisted of some strokes with a heavy club or mallet, which always materially hastened the death of the sufferer, and often caused it almost immediately.Edersheim, in LTJM, II, 613, suggests that the breaking of legs was a...</p>

In Septuagint daneizo, danizo, &quot;to lend,&quot; translates lawah, and `abaT in above passages and in Ne 5:4; Pr 22:7, and Isa 24:2; kichrao, also translations lawah and sha&#x27;al (Ps 112:5; Pr 13:11); daneion(-ion), &quot;loan,&quot; occurs in De 15:8,10; 24:11; 4 Macc 2:8. In the New Testament &quot;lend&quot; translations two Greek verbs, daneizo, &quot;to lend money&quot; (Lu 6:34,35, usually in commercial sense); kichremi, &quot;to lend (as a friendly act)&quot; (Lu 11:5).The substantive &quot;loan,&quot; she&#x27;elah, occurs only once in the Old Testament (1Sa 2:20 the King James Version and the English Revised Version), not at all in the New Testament.2. History of Lending in the Bible and Apocrypha:(1) Lending on interest to the poor is prohibited in the code in Ex 22:25. (2) In the code in De 15:1-6; 23:19,20; 24:10,11; 28:12,44, borrowing and lending are taken for granted as existing in Israel, but the creditor is required to release his Hebrew brother as debtor in the 7th year (either the cancellation of the loan (so in Jewish literature and early Christian scholars) or suspension of payment that year (so most modern scholars)), though he may exact payment from a foreigner. Israel may lend, and will be able to lend, because of Yahweh&#x27;s blessing, to other nations, but must not borrow from them. A pledge, or security, must not be taken in person by the creditor from the house of the debtor, nor kept overnight, if the debtor be poor. (3) The code in Le 25:35-38 requires that the Israelite receive no interest from his poor brother, because of the goodness of Yahweh to Israel. (4) Notwithstanding the prohibition of the early laws against lending on interest or usury, the same seems to have become common in Israel before the exile (Isa 24:2; Jer 15:10), was practiced on the return, and was an evil to be corrected by Nehemiah (Ne 5:7,10). (5) According to Ps 37:26; 112:5; Pr 19:17, lending to the needy was regarded as a mark of the pious Hebrew, but no interest is to be charged. (6) According to Apocrypha (The Wisdom of Solomon 15:16; Sirach 8:12; 18:33; 20:15,29; 4 Macc 2:8), borrowing is discouraged, and lending is exalted as a mark of the merciful man.

The flour is highly nutritious, and the well-known food, Revalenta arabica, is simply one form, specially prepared; `adas are highly esteemed in Palestine, and are used in soup and as a &quot;pottage&quot; known as mujedderah. This last is of a reddish-brown color and is without doubt the &quot;pottage&quot; of Ge 25:34. Lentils were part of the provisions brought to David when fleeing from Absalom (2Sa 17:28) and were used in the making of the bread for the prophet Ezekiel (4:9). In a &quot;plot of ground full of lentils,&quot; Shammah, one of David&#x27;s &quot;mighty men,&quot; stood and defended it and slew the marauding Philistines (2Sa 23:11,12).E. W. G. Masterman</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">lep&#x27;-erd ((1) namer (So 4:8; Isa 11:6; Jer 5:6; 13:23; Ho 13:7; Hab 1:8); compare Arabic nimr, &quot;leopard.&quot; (2) Chaldaic nemar (Da 7:6). (3) pardalis (Re 13:2; Ecclesiasticus 28:23); compare nimrim Nimrim (Isa 15:6; Jer 48:34), nimrah, Nimrah (Nu 32:3), and beth-nimrah, Beth-nimrah (Nu 32:36; Jos 13:27)): The leopard is found throughout Africa and ranges through Southern Asia from Asia Minor to Japan, being absent from Siberia and Central Asia. Its range is much the same as that of the lion, which latter, however, does not extend so far to the East. Like other animals of wide range, it has local varieties, but these shade into each other imperceptibly, and the one specific name, Felis pardus, includes all. Leopards live in some of the valleys East and South of the Dead Sea, and in the mountains of Sinai and Northwestern Arabia. They have but rarely been seen of recent years in Lebanon or the more settled portions of Palestine. So far as can be judged from skins which are available for comparison, the leopard of Palestine is rather light in color, and is not as large as. some found in Africa or India. It is not certain that the place-names, NIMRIM, NIMRAH, and BETH-NIMRAH (which see), have to do with namer, &quot;leopard,&quot; but their location is in Moab, where leopards are well known, even at the present day. One of the valleys entering the Dead Sea from the East, South of the Arnon, is called Wadi-en-Numeir (&quot;valley of the little leopard&quot;; numeir, diminutive of nimr).In the Bible &quot;leopard&quot; occurs mainly in figurative expressions, as a large and fierce beast. The leopard is mentioned with the lion and bear in Da 7:6; Ho 13:7; Re 13:2; with the lion, wolf and bear in Isa 11:6; with the lion and wolf in Jer 5:6; with the lion alone in Ecclesiasticus 28:23; with the wolf alone in Hab 1:8. The leopard is smaller than the lion and the tiger, but is more active than either. Its swiftness is referred to in Hab 1:8: &quot;Their horses also (of the Chaldeans) are swifter than leopards.&quot; The spots of the leopard are referred to in Jer 13:23: &quot;Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?&quot;The Greek pardalis, and panther, were both applied to the leopard. &quot;Panther&quot; is sometimes used of large leopards, while in America, with its corrupt form &quot;painter,&quot; it is one of the names applied to the cougar or puma, Felis concolor, which, as the specific name implies, is not spotted like the leopard, or striped like the tiger.Alfred Ely Day</p>

Other signs are(1) that the hairs of the affected part turn white and(2) that later there is a growth of &quot;quick raw flesh.&quot;This disease in an especial manner rendered its victims unclean; even contact with a leper defiled whoever touched him, so while the cure of other diseases is called healing, that of leprosy is called cleansing (except in the case of Miriam (Nu 12:13) and that of the Samaritan (Lu 17:15) where the word &quot;heal&quot; is used in reference to leprosy). The disease is described in the Papyrus Ebers as ukhedu (the Coptic name for leprosy is tseht). It is also mentioned in ancient Indian and Japanese history. Hippocrates calls it &quot;the Phoenician disease,&quot; and Galen names it &quot;elephantiasis.&quot; In Europe it was little known until imported by the returning soldiers of Pompey&#x27;s army after his Syrian campaign in 61 BC; but after that date it is described by Soranus, Aretaeus and other classic authors.1. Old Testament Instances:The first Old Testament mention of this disease is as a sign given by God to Moses (Ex 4:6 (Jahwist)), which may be the basis of the story in Josephus&#x27; Apion, I, 31, that Moses was expelled from Heliopolis on account of his being a leper (see also I, 26 and Ant, III, xi, 4). The second case is that of Miriam (Nu 12:10), where the disease is graphically described (EP2). In De 24:8 there is a reference to the oral tradition concerning the treatment of lepers, without any details, but in Le 13; 14 (Priestly Code) the rules for the recognition of the disease, the preliminary quarantine periods and the ceremonial methods of cleansing are given at length. It is worthy of note that neither here nor elsewhere is there any mention of treatment or remedy; and Jehoram&#x27;s ejaculation implies the belief that its cure could be accomplished only by miracle (2Ki 5:7).The case of Naaman (2Ki 5:1) shows that lepers were not isolated and excluded from society among the Syrians. The leprosy of Gehazi (2Ki 5:27) is said to have been the transference of that of Naaman, but, as the incubation period is long, it must have been miraculously inflicted on him. The four lepers of Samaria of 2Ki 7:3 had been excluded from the city and were outside the gate.The leprous stroke inflicted on Uzziah (2Ki 15:5; 2Ch 26:23) for his unwarrantable assumption of the priestly office began in his forehead, a form of the disease peculiarly unclean (Le 13:43-46) and requiring the banishment and isolation of the leper. It is remarkable that there is no reference to this disease in the prophetical writings, or in the Hagiographa.2. Leprosy in the New Testament:In the New Testament, cleansing of the lepers is mentioned...</p>

In this passage the name is connected with the verb lawah, &quot;to adhere,&quot; or &quot;be joined to,&quot; Leah expressing assurance that with the birth of this third son, her husband might be drawn closer to her in the bonds of conjugal affection. There is a play upon the name in Nu 18:2,4, where direction is given that the tribe of Levi be &quot;joined unto&quot; Aaron in the ministries of the sanctuary. The etymology here suggested is simple and reasonable. The grounds on which some modern scholars reject it are purely conjectural. It is asserted, e.g., that the name is adjectival, not nominal, describing one who attaches himself; and this is used to support theory that the Levites were those who joined the Semitic people when they left Egypt to return to Palestine, who therefore were probably Egyptians. Others think it may be a gentilic form le&#x27;ah, &quot;wild cow&quot; (Wellhausen, Prolegomena, 146; Stade, Stade, Geschichte des Volkes Israel, 152); and this is held to be the more probable, as pointing to early totem worship!Levi shared with Simeon the infamy incurred at Shechem by the treacherous slaughter of the Shechemites (Ge 34). Jacob&#x27;s displeasure was expressed at the time (Ge 34:3), and the memory was still bitter to him in his last days (Ge 49:5 f). The fate predicted for the descendants of Simeon and Levi (Ge 49:7), in the case of the latter on account of the tribe&#x27;s stedfast loyalty in a period of stern testing, was changed to a blessing (Ex 32:26). In later literature the action condemned by Jacob is mentioned with approval (Judith 9:2 ff). Levi was involved in his brothers&#x27; guilt with regard to Joseph (Ge 37), and shared their experiences in Egypt before Joseph made himself known (Ge 42; 43; 44; 45). Three sons, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, were born to him in Canaan, and went down with the caravan to Egypt (Ge 46:11). Nothing further is known of the personal history of this patriarch. He died and found sepulture in Egypt. For the tribal history and possessions, see PRIESTS AND LEVITES.W. Ewing</p>

The description in Job 41 has been thought by some to refer to the whale, but while the whale suits better the expressions denoting great strength, the words apply best on the whole to the crocodile. Moreover, the whale is very seldom found in the Mediterranean, while the crocodile is abundant in the Nile, and has been known to occur in at least one river of Palestine, the Zarqa, North of Jaffa. For a discussion of the behemoth and leviathan as mythical creatures, see EB, under the word &quot;Behemoth&quot; and &quot;Leviathan.&quot; The points in the description which may well apply to the crocodile are the great invulnerability, the strong and close scales, the limbs and the teeth. It must be admitted that there are many expressions which a modern scientist would not use with reference to the crocodile, but the Book of Job is neither modern nor scientific, but poetical and ancient.(2) See ASTRONOMY, sec.

ALTERNATIVE VIEW AND EVIDENCE1. Traces of the Cities2. Wellhausen&#x27;s Arguments Answered3. Van Hoonacker&#x27;s Reply4. Ezekiel&#x27;s Vision5. Priestly Cities and Cities in Which Priests DwellLITERATUREI. Legal Provisions.1. Numbers: Nu 35:1-8 provides that 48 cities should be given to the Levites, each surrounded by a pasturage. The exact details are not quite clear, for in the Hebrew, Nu 35:4 would naturally be read as meaning that the pasturage was a radius of 1,000 cubits from the city walls, while 35:5 makes each city the center of a square, each side of which was 2,000 cubits long. Extant variants in the versions suggest, however, that the text has suffered slightly in transmission. Originally there seems to have been no discrepancy between the two verses, and it may be doubted whether the intent was that the city was always to be in the mathematical center of the patch. The Levites were to have the right of redeeming the houses at any time, and in default of redemption they were to go out in the Jubilee. The field was not to be sold (Le 25:32 f).2. Deuteronomy:De 18:8 undoubtedly recognizes patrimonial possessions of the Levites outside the religious capital, and sees no inconsistency with its earlier statement that Levi had no portion or inheritance with Israel (18:1). The explanation lies in the fact that these cities were not a tribal portion like the territories of the secular tribes. The area occupied by the whole 48 jointly would only have amounted to less than 16 miles.II. Wellhausen&#x27;s View.Jos 21 relates that this command was fulfilled by the allocation of 48 cities, but it is clear that some of those cities were not in fact reduced into possession; see e.g. Jos 16:10; Jud 1:29 as to Gezer, and Jud 1:27 as to Taanach. Wellhausen treats the whole arrangement as fictitious. His main reasons are: (1) that the arrangement is physically impracticable in a mountainous country, and (2) that &quot;there is not a historical trace of the existence of the Levitical cities.&quot; Many remained in the hands of the Canaanites till a late period, while others were &quot;important but by no means ecclesiastical towns&quot; (Prolegomena, 160). Two pages later he says that &quot;four of them were demonstrably famous old seats of worship,&quot; and conjectures that most, if not all, were ancient sanctuaries. He also regards Ezekiel&#x27;s scheme of a heave offering of land (Eze 45) as the origin of the idea. Yet &quot;Jerus and the temple, which, properly speaking, occasioned the whole arrangement, are buried in silence with a diligence which is in the highest degree surprising&quot; (p. 164).III. Alternative View and Evidence.1. Traces of the Cities:In point of fact, there are traces of some of the Levitical cities in the later history. Such are Anathoth (1Ki 2:26; Jer 1:1; 32), Jattir (2Sa 20:26, where, as shown in the article PRIESTS AND LEVITES (which see), Jattirite should be read for the Massoretic Jairite), Beth-sheme...</p>

Name:The third book of the Pentateuch is generally named by the Jews according to the first word, wayyiqra&#x27; (Origen Ouikra, by the Septuagint called according to its contents Leuitikon, or Leueitikon, by the Vulgate, accordingly, &quot;Leviticus&quot; (i.e. Liber), sometimes &quot;Leviticum&quot;). The Jews have also another name taken from its contents, namely, torath kohanim, &quot;Law of the Priests.&quot;2. Character of Book:As a matter of fact ordinances pertaining to the priesthood, to the Levitical system, and to the cults constitute a most important part of this book; but specifically religious and ethical commands, as we find them, e.g. in Le 18; 19; 20, are not wanting; and there are also some historical sections, which, however, are again connected with the matter referring to the cults, namely the consecration of the priests in Le 8 and 9, the sin and the punishment of two sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu (10:1 ff), and the account of the stoning of a blasphemer (24:10 ff). Of the Levites, on the other hand, the book does not treat at all. They are mentioned only once and that incidentally in 25:32 ff. The laws are stated to have been given behar Cinay (7:38; 25:1; 26:46; 27:34), which expression, on account of Le 11, in which Yahweh is described as speaking to Moses out of the tent of meeting, is not to be translated &quot;upon&quot; but &quot;at&quot; Mt. Sinai. The connection of this book with the preceding and following books, i.e. Exodus and Numbers, which is commonly acknowledged as being the case, at least in some sense, leaves for the contents of Leviticus exactly the period of a single month, since the last chronological statement of Ex 40:17 as the time of the erection of the tabernacle mentions the 1st day of the 1st month of the 2nd year of the Exodus, and Nu 1:1 takes us to the 1st day of the 2nd month of the same year. Within this time of one month the consecration of the priests fills out 8 days (Le 8:33; 9:1). A sequence in time is indicated only by Le 16:1, which directly connects with what is reported in Le 10 concerning Nadab and Abihu. In the same way the ordinances given in 10:6 ff are connected with the eve...</p>

Found only in Ho 2:10; the American Revised Version margin &quot;shame.&quot;2. In the New Testament:The word translated &quot;lewd,&quot; &quot;lewdness&quot; in the King James Version occurs only twice in the New Testament, and in each instance is more correctly translated in the Revised Version (British and American) by another word:(1) Poneros, found in Ac 17:5, translated in the American Standard Revised Version &quot;vile.&quot; The Greek word elsewhere is translated &quot;bad,&quot; &quot;evil,&quot; &quot;grievous,&quot; &quot;harmful,&quot; &quot;malicious,&quot; &quot;wicked.&quot; the King James Version &quot;lewd&quot; gives the wrong impression. The idea of unchastity is not present in the text or context.(2) Rhadiourgema likewise occurs only once, namely, Ac 18:14, and is correctly translated in the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version &quot;wicked villany.&quot; The thought of impurity or lewdness is foreign to the meaning in this connection.William Edward Raffety</p>

The answer may aid in the interpretation of &quot;Libertines&quot;:(1) The words may be read as denoting one synagogue (Calvin). However(a) the number of worshippers would be extremely large,(b) the bond of union is not obvious,(c) rabbinic tradition speaks of 480 synagogues in Jerusalem.(2) The double ton (&quot;of them&quot;) seems to denote two parties, the one consisting &quot;of them that were of the synagogue called (the synagogue) of Libertines and Cyrenians and Alexandrians,&quot; the other &quot;of them of Cilicia and Asia&quot;, (Winer, Wendt, Holtzmann). But the second ton is dependent on synagogue. &quot;As Cyrenians and Alexandrians both belong to towns .... a change of designation would be necessary when the Jews of whole provinces came to be mentioned: this being the case, the article could not but be repeated, without any reference to the ton before&quot; (Alford).(3) There were three synagogues:(a) that of the Libertines,(b) that of the Cyrenians and Alexandrians and(c) that &quot;of them of Cilicia and Asia&quot; (Alford). There is no grammatical reason for this division, but it is based on an interpretation of &quot;Libertines.&quot; There were &quot;Libertines,&quot; Africans and Asiatics.(4) Each party had a separate synagogue (Schurer, Hausrath). The number of worshippers, their different origin and connections, and the number of synagogues in Jerusalem give weight to this view.2. Interpretation of &quot;Libertines&quot;:(1) They are &quot;freedmen,&quot; liberated slaves or their descendants. Against this it is held that the Greek equivalent (apeleutheroi) would have been used in this case. However, the Roman designation would be common all over the empire. In what sense were they &quot;freedmen&quot;? Various answers are given:(a) they were freedmen from Jewish servitude (Lightfoot);(b) they were Italian freedmen who had become proselytes;(c) they were &quot;the freedmen of the Romans&quot; (Chrysostom), the descendants of Jewish freedmen at Rome who had been expelled by Tiberius. In 63 BC Pompey had taken prisoners of war to Rome. These, being liberated by those who had ac...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">lib&#x27;-er-ti (deror, rachabh; eleutheria): The opposite of servitude or bondage, hence, applicable to captives or slaves set free from oppression (thus deror, Le 25:10; Isa 61:1, etc.). Morally, the power which enslaves is sin (Joh 8:34), and liberty consists, not simply in external freedom, or in possession of the formal power of choice, but in deliverance from the darkening of the mind, the tyranny of sinful lusts and the enthrallment of the will, induced by a morally corrupt state. In a positive respect, it consists in the possession of holiness, with the will and ability to do what is right and good. Such liberty is possible only in a renewed condition of soul, and cannot exist apart from godliness. Even under the Old Testament godly men could boast of a measure of such liberty (Ps 119:45, rachabh, &quot;room,&quot; &quot;breadth&quot;), but it is the gospel of Christ which bestows it in its fullness, in giving a full and clear knowledge of God, discovering the way of forgiveness, supplying the highest motives to holiness and giving the Holy Spirit to destroy the power of sin and to quicken to righteousness. In implanting a new life in the soul, the gospel lifts the believer out of the sphere of external law, and gives him a sense of freedom in his new filial relation to God. Hence, the New Testament expressions about &quot;the glorious liberty&quot; of God&#x27;s children (Ro 8:21 the King James Version; compare Ga 2:4; 5:13, etc.), about liberty as resulting from the possession of the Spirit (2Co 3:17), about &quot;the perfect law of liberty&quot; (Jas 1:25). The instrument through which this liberty is imparted is &quot;the truth&quot; (Joh 8:32). Christians are earnestly warned not to presume upon, or abuse their liberty in Christ (Ga 5:13; 1Pe 2:16).James Orr</p>

Probably the same as Laban (De 1:1).See WANDERINGS OF ISRAEL.(2) A town in the Shephelah of Judah (Jos 15:42). &quot;Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah: and Yahweh delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel. .... And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it&quot; (Jos 10:29-31; 12:15). It was one of the cities given to the &quot;children of Aaron&quot; (Jos 21:13; 1Ch 6:57). In the reign of Joram, Libnah joined the Edomites in a revolt against the king of Judah (2Ki 8:22; 2Ch 21:10). In the reign of Hezekiah, Libnah was besieged by Sennacherib (2Ki 19:8; Isa 37:8). The wife of King Josiah was &quot;Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah,&quot; she was the mother of Jehoahaz and Zedekiah (2Ki 23:31; 24:18; Jer 52:1).The site of this important stronghold remains unknown. In the Eusebius, Onomasticon it is described, under the name Lobana or Lobna, as near Eleutheropolis (Beit Jebrin). All the indications point to a site in the Southwest of the Shephelah, not very far from Lachish. The Palestine Exploration Fund surveyors suggested (PEF, III, 259) the commanding site `Arak el Menshiyeh, or rather the white chalky mound 250 ft. high to the North of this village, and Stanley proposed Tell es Cafi. (Both these identifications are due to the interpretation of Libnah as meaning &quot;whiteness.&quot;) In the PEFS (1897, Sh XX) Conder suggests a ruin called el Benawy, 10 miles Southeast of Lachish.E.

Period of the Judges12. Saul to the Maccabees13. New Testament Times14. Bookcases and BuildingsLITERATUREA library is a book or books kept for use, not for sale. A one-book library is just as much a library as a one-cell animal is animal. The earliest libraries, like the earliest plants and animals, were very simple, consisting of a few books or perhaps only a single tablet or manuscript. An archive is a library of official documents not in active use; a registry, a library of going documents.1. The Bible a Library:The Bible is itself a library. During the Middle Ages it was commonly called, first, &quot;The Divine Library,&quot; and then, &quot;The Library&quot; (Bibliotheca), in the same exclusive sense as it is now known as &quot;The Book&quot; (Biblia as Latin singular). Even the word &quot;Bible&quot; itself is historically &quot;Library&quot; rather than &quot;Book&quot; (for it was originally the neuter plural Biblia, &quot;The Books&quot;; compare Da 9:2). The Bible is also a library in that it is an organized collection of books rather than a single work.This fact that the Bible is itself a library is increasingly mentioned of late, especially in Old Testament studies (Kent, Narratives of the Beginnings of Hebrew History, 1, &quot;The Old Testament as a Library&quot;; Delitzsch, Babel and Bible, 4, &quot;the Old Testament, that small library of books of the most multifarious kind&quot;). Its profound bearing on the theory of the composition and inspiration of the Bible (compare BOOK) has given the fact new significance and makes an understanding of the nature of a library one of the best tools for the interpretation of the Bible in the face of modern problems. While it is not possible to elaborate this within these limits, it may be said briefly that the logical end of the application of the doctrine of evolution to books and libraries is that the Bible is, like man, the result of natural selection, and is as unique among books as man among the animals. And, whatever may be true of men, in the case of books the formation of a book-library by natural selection tends toward the elimination of error. The more numerous the individuals and the longer the period, the greater the reduction of error, so that the logical inference as to the Bible is that on purely natural grounds it may be, or is, the nearest approximation to inerrancy among books, because of its history as a library. This does not quite lead to the position that the Bible is as unique among books as Jesus Christ among men, but under the doctrine of a creative Providence, it does imply what may be called real superhuman authorship and authority.2. Mythological and Apocryphal Libraries:Somewhat apart from historical libraries, but closely connected with Bible study, are the alleged superhuman libra...</p>

Lying Defined:In its very essence, a lie is something said with intent to deceive. It is not always a spoken word that is a lie, for a life lived under false pretenses, a hypocritical life, may be a lie equally with a false word (Jer 23:14). A vain thing, like an idol, may be a lie (Isa 59:4), as also a false system (Ro 3:7). Error, as opposed to truth, is a lie (1 Joh 2:21). The denial of the deity of Jesus Christ is regarded as &quot;the&quot; lie (1 Joh 2:22).The origin of lies and lying is traced to Satan who is called &quot;a liar, and the father thereof&quot; (Joh 8:44; Ac 5:3). Satan&#x27;s dealing with Eve (Ge 3) furnishes us with a splendid illustration of the first lie, so far as we have any record of it.2. A Racial Sin:The whole race is guilty of this sin: &quot;The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies&quot; (Ps 58:3). It is a part of the old Adamic nature, &quot;the old man&quot; (Col 3:9), which the believer in Jesus Christ is called upon to put off. So prominent a factor is it in the experience of the race that among the condensed catalogue of sins, for the commission of which men are finally condemned, the sin of lying finds its place: &quot;All liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone&quot; (Re 21:8 the King James Version).3. God&#x27;s Attitude to It:God&#x27;s attitude toward this sin is strongly marked throughout both the Old Testament and New Testament. The righteous are called upon to hate lying (Pr 13:5), to avoid it (Ze 3:13), to respect not those who lie, and utterly reject their company (Ps 40:4; 101:7), to pray to be delivered from it (Ps 119:29). The wicked are said to love lying (Ps 52:3), to delight in it (Ps 62:4), to seek after it (Ps 4:2), and to give heed to it (Pr 17:4). Lying leads to worse crimes (Ho 4:1,2).4. The Penalty:The punishment to be meted out to liars is of the severest kind. They are positively and absolutely excluded from heaven (Re 21:27; 22:15), and those who are guilty of this sin are cast into the lake of fire (Re 21:8). We are reminded of the awful fate meted out to Ananias and Sapphira when they lied to God and man (Ac 5:1-11). God will &quot;destroy them that speak lies&quot; (Ps 5:6), and &quot;he that uttereth lies shall not escape&quot; (Pr 19:5), yea &quot;a sword is upon the liars&quot; (Jer 50:36 the King James Version). The liar is thereby debarred from rendering any true and acceptable worship unto the Lord (Ps 24:4).The Scriptures abound with illustrations of lying and the results and penalties therefor. A careful study of these illustrations will reveal the subtlety of falsehood. Sometimes a lie is a half-truth, as set forth in the story of Satan&#x27;s temptation of Eve (Ge 3). Cain&#x27;s lie (Ge 4:9) was of the nature of an evasive answer to a direct question. Jacob&#x27;s deception of his fathe...</p>

Popular Use of the Term2. Complexity of the IdeaIII. IN THE APOCRYPHAIV. IN THE NEW TESTAMENT1. In the Synoptic Gospels2. In the Fourth Gospel3. In the Ac of the Apostles4. In the Writings of Paul5. In the Writings of John6. In the Other Books of the New TestamentLITERATUREI. The Terms.Of the Hebrew terms, chayah is the verb which means &quot;to live,&quot; &quot;to have life,&quot; or the vital principle, &quot;to continue to live,&quot; or &quot;to live prosperously.&quot; In the Piel it signifies &quot;to give life, or preserve, or quicken and restore life.&quot; The Hiphil is much like the Piel. The noun hayyim generally used in the plural is an abstract noun meaning &quot;life,&quot; i.e. the possession of the vital principle with its energies and activities. Nephesh often means &quot;living being&quot; or &quot;creature.&quot; Sometimes it has the force of the reflexive &quot;self.&quot; At other times it refers to the seat of the soul, the personality, the emotions, the appetites--passions and even mental acts. Frequently it means &quot;life,&quot; the &quot;seat of life,&quot; and in this way it is used about 171 times in the Old Testament, referring to the principle of vitality in both men and animals. Ruach signifies &quot;wind,&quot; &quot;breath,&quot; principle or source of vitality, but is never used to signify life proper.II. The Old Testament Teaching.1. Popular Use of the Term:The term &quot;life&quot; is used in the Old Testament in the popular sense. It meant life in the body, the existence and activity of the man in all his parts and energies. It is the person complete, conscious and active. There is no idea of the body being a fetter or prison to the soul; the body was essential to life and the writers had no desire to be separated from it. To them the physical sphere was a necessity, and a man was living when all his activities were performed in the light of God&#x27;s face and favor. The secret and source of life to them was relationship with God. There was nothing good or desirable apart from this relation of fellowship. To overcome or be rid of sin was necessary to life. The real center of gravity in life was in the moral and religious part of man&#x27;s nature. This must be in fellowship with God, the source of all life and activity.2. Complexity of the Idea:The conception of life is very complex. Several meanings are clearly indicated:(1) Very frequently it refers to the vital principle itself, apart from its manifestations (Ge 2:7). Here it is the breath of life, or the breath from God which contained and communicated the vital principle to man and made him a nephesh or living being (see also Ge 1:30; 6:17; 7:22; 45:5, etc.).(2) It is used to denote the period of one&#x27;s actual existence, i.e. &quot;lifetime&quot; (Ge 23:1; 25:7; 47:9; Ex 6:16,18,20, etc.).(3) The life is represented as a direct gift from God, and dependent absolutely upon Him for its continuance (Ge 1:11-27; 2:7; Nu 16:22).(4) In a few cases it refers to the conception of children, denoting the time wh...</p>

A very common word in English Versions of the Bible representing a great variety of Hebrew and Greek words, although in the Old Testament used chiefly as the translation of nasa&#x27;. Of none of these words, however, is &quot;lift&quot; used as a technical translation, and &quot;lift&quot; is interchanged freely with its synonyms, especially &quot;exalt&quot; (compare Ps 75:5; 89:24) and &quot;raise&quot; (compare Ec 4:10; 2Sa 12:17). &quot;Lift&quot; is still perfectly good English, but not in all the senses in which it is used in English Versions of the Bible; e.g. such phrases as &quot;men that lifted up axes upon a thicket&quot; (Ps 74:5), &quot;lift up thy feet unto the perpetual ruins&quot; (Ps 74:3, etc.), and even the common &quot;lift up the eyes&quot; or &quot;hands&quot; are distinctly archaic. However, almost all the uses are perfectly clear, and only the following need be noted. &quot;To lift up the head&quot; (Ge 40:13,19,20; 2Ki 25:27; Ps 3:3; Sirach 11:13; Lu 21:28) means to raise from a low condition (but on Ps 24:7,9 see GATE). To &quot;lift up the horn&quot; (Ps 75:5) is to assume a confident position, the figure being taken from fighting oxen (see HORN). &quot;Lift up the face&quot; may be meant literally (2Ki 9:32), or it may denote the bestowal of favor (Ps 4:6); it may mean the attitude of a righteous man toward God (Job 22:26), or simply the attitude of a suppliant (Ezr 9:6).Burton Scott Easton</p>

Expressive Terms1. Origin of Light:The creation of light was the initial step in the creation of life. &quot;Let there be light&quot; (Ge 1:3) was the first word of God spoken after His creative Spirit &quot;moved&quot; upon the primary material out of which He created the heavens and the earth, and which lay, until the utterance of that word, in the chaos of darkness and desolation. Something akin, possibly, to the all-pervasive electro-magnetic activity of the aurora borealis penetrated the chaotic night of the world. The ultimate focusing of light (on the 4th day of creation, Ge 1:14) in suns, stars, and solar systems brought the initial creative process to completion, as the essential condition of all organic life. The origin of light thus finds its explanation in the purpose and very nature of God whom John defines as not only the Author of light but, in an all-inclusive sense, as light itself: &quot;God is light&quot; (1 Joh 1:5).2. A Comprehensive Term:The word &quot;light&quot; is Divinely rich in its comprehensiveness and meaning. Its material splendor is used throughout the Scriptures as the symbol and synonym of all that is luminous and radiant in the mental, moral and spiritual life of men and angels; while the eternal God, because of His holiness and moral perfection, is pictured as &quot;dwelling in light unapproachable&quot; (1Ti 6:16). Every phase of the word, from the original light in the natural world to the spiritual glory of the celestial, is found in Holy Writ.(1) Natural Light.The light of day (Ge 1:5); of sun, moon and stars; &quot;lights in the firmament&quot; (Ge 1:14-18; Ps 74:16; 136:7; 148:3; Ec 12:2; Re 22:5). Its characteristics are beauty, radiance, utility. It &quot;rejoiceth the heart&quot; (Pr 15:30); &quot;Truly the light is sweet&quot; (Ec 11:7); without it men stumble and are helpless (Joh 11:9,10); it is something for which they wait with inexpressible longing (Job 30:26; compare Ps 130:6). Life, joy, activity and all blessings are dependent upon light.Light and life are almost synonymous to the inhabitants of Palestine, and in the same way darkness and death. Theirs is the land of sunshine. When they go to other lands of clouded skies their only thought is to return to the brightness and sunshine of their native land. In Palestine there is hardly a day in the whole year when the sun does not shine for some part of it, while for five months of the year there is scarcely an interruption of the sunshine. Time is reckoned from sunset to sunset. The day&#x27;s labor closes with the coming of darkness. &quot;Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labor until the evening&quot; (Ps 104:23).The suddenness of the change from darkness to light with the rising sun and the disappearance of the sun in the evening is more striking than in more northern count...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">lit&#x27;-ning (baraq, chaziz; astrape): Lightning is caused by the discharge of electricity between clouds or between clouds and the earth. In a thunder-storm there is a rapid gathering of particles of moisture into clouds and forming of large drops of rain. This gathers with it electric potential until the surface of the cloud (or the enlarged water particles) is insufficient to carry the charge, and a discharge takes place, producing a brilliant flash of light and the resulting thunder-clap. Thunder-storms are common in Syria and Palestine during the periods of heavy rain in the spring and fall and are often severe. Lightning is usually accompanied by heavy rainfall or by hail, as at the time of the plague of hail (Ex 9:24).See HAIL.In the Scriptures it is used:(a) indicating the power of God: The power of God is shown in His command of the forces of Nature, and He is the only one who knows the secrets of Nature: &quot;He made .... a way for the lightning&quot; (Job 28:26); &quot;He directeth .... his lightning&quot; (Job 37:3 the King James Version); &quot;Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go?&quot; (Job 38:35); &quot;Ask ye of Yahweh .... that maketh lightnings&quot; (Zec 10:1). See also Ps 18:14; 97:4; 135:7; Job 36:32; Jer 10:13;(b) figuratively and poetically: David sings of Yahweh, &quot;He sent .... lightnings manifold, and discomfited them&quot; (Ps 18:14); used for speed: &quot;The chariots .... run like the lightnings&quot; (Na 2:4): &quot;His arrow shall go forth as the lightning&quot; (Zec 9:14); &quot;The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning&quot; (Eze 1:14). The coming of the kingdom is described by Jesus as the shining of the lightning from one part of heaven to another, even &quot;from the east unto the west&quot; (Mt 24:27; Lu 17:24);(c) meaning bright or shining: Daniel in his vision saw a man and &quot;his face (was) as the appearance of lightning&quot; (Da 10:6).

So the Revised Version (British and American) has modernized the archaic &quot;like precious faith&quot; of 2Pe 1:1 by inserting &quot;a&quot; before &quot;like.&quot; The King James Version&#x27;s rendering of 1Pe 3:21, &quot;the like figure whereunto,&quot; could not have been very clear at any time, and the Revised Version (British and American) has revised completely into &quot;after a true likeness&quot; (margin, &quot;in the antitype&quot;).(3) As an adverb &quot;like&quot; is used in Jer 38:9, &quot;He is like to die&quot;; Jon 1:4, &quot;like to be broken.&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) could have used &quot;likely&quot; in these verses. Most common of all the uses of &quot;like&quot; is the quasi-prepositional construction in &quot;He is like a man,&quot; etc. This is of course good modern English, but not so when &quot;like&quot; is enlarged (as it usually is in the English Versions of the Bible) into the forms &quot;like to&quot; (Da 7:5), &quot;like unto&quot; (very common), &quot;like as&quot; (Isa 26:17, etc.). These forms and the simple &quot;like&quot; are interchanged without much distinction, and the Revised Version (British and American) has attempted little systematizing beyond reducing the occurrences of &quot;like as&quot; (compare Mt 12:13, and the American Standard Revised Version Isa 13:4; Jer 23:29).(4) The verb &quot;like&quot; has two distinct meanings, &quot;be pleased with&quot; and &quot;give pleasure to.&quot; The latter sense occurs in De 23:16 (The King James Version, the English Revised Version), &quot;in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best,&quot; and in Es 8:8; Am 4:5 the King James Version; Sirach 33:13 (the American Standard Revised Version has &quot;pleaseth&quot; in the three Old Testament passages). The other use of &quot;like&quot; belongs also to modern English, although in a much weakened sense. On account of this weakening, 1Ch 28:4 the King James Version, &quot;liked me to make me king&quot; and Ro 1:28 the King James Version &quot;did not like to retain God,&quot; have become in the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;took pleasure in&quot; and &quot;refused to&quot; (margin &quot;did not approve&quot;).

This was probably the model of the architectural ornament, translated &quot;lily-work,&quot; which appeared upon the capitals of the columns in the temple porch (1Ki 7:19), upon the top of the pillars (1Ki 7:22) and upon the turned-back rim of the &quot;molten sea&quot; (1Ki 7:26).Botanically the word shoshannah, like the similar modern Arabic Susan, included in all probability a great many flowers, and was used in a way at least as wide as the popular use of the English word &quot;lily.&quot; The expression &quot;lily of the valleys&quot; (So 2:1) has nothing to do with the plant of that name; the flowers referred to appear to have been associated with the rank herbage of the valley bottoms (So 4:5); the expression &quot;His lips are as lilies&quot; (So 5:13) might imply a scarlet flower, but more probably in oriental imagery signifies a sweet-scented flower; the sweet scent of the lily is referred to in Ecclesiasticus 39:14, and in 50:8 we read of &quot;lilies by the rivers of water.&quot; The beauty of the blossom is implied in Ho 14:5, where Yahweh promises that repentant Israel shall &quot;blossom as the lily.&quot; A &quot;heap of wheat set about with lilies&quot; (So 7:2) probably refers to the smoothed-out piles of newly threshed wheat on the threshing-floors decorated by a circlet of flowers.The reference of our Lord to the &quot;lilies of the field&quot; is probably, like the Old Testament references, quite a general one.The Hebrew and the Greek very likely include not only any members of the great order Liliaceae, growing in Palestine, e.g. asphodel, squill, hyacinth, ornithogalum (&quot;Star of Bethlehem&quot;), fritillaria, tulip and colocynth, but also the more showy irises (&quot;Tabor lilies&quot; &quot;purple irises,&quot; etc.) and the beautiful gladioli of the Natural Order. Irideae and the familiar narcissi of the Natural Order Amaryllideae.In later Jewish literature the lily is very frequently referred to symbolically, and a lotus or lily was commonly pictured on several Jewish coins.E.

Gir is translated &quot;plaster&quot; in Da 5:5, &quot;wrote .... upon the plaster of the wall.&quot; In Isa 27:9 we have, &quot;He maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones&quot; (&#x27;abhene-ghir).Everywhere in Palestine limestone is at hand which can be converted into lime. The lime-kiln is a thick-walled, cylindrical or conical, roofless structure built of rough stones without mortar, the spaces between the stones being plastered with clay. It is usually built on the side of a hill which is slightly excavated for it, so that the sloping, external wall of the kiln rises much higher from the ground on the lower side than on the upper. The builders leave a passage or tunnel through the base of the thick wall on the lower side. The whole interior is filled with carefully packed fragments of limestone, and large piles of thorny-burner and other shrubs to serve as fuel are gathered about the kiln. The fuel is introduced through the tunnel to the base of the limestone in the kiln, and as the fire rises through the mass of broken limestone a strong draft is created. Relays of men are kept busy supplying fuel day and night. By day a column of black smoke rises from the kiln, and at night the flames may be seen bursting from the top. Several days are required to reduce the stone to lime, the amount of time depending upon the size of the kiln and upon the nature of the fuel. At the present day, mineral coal imported from Europe is sometimes employed, and requires much less time than the shrubs which are ordinarily used.See CHALKSTONE; CLAY.Alfred Ely Day</p>

Other Hebrew words mean simply a cord or thread (Jos 2:18,21; 1Ki 7:15; Eze 40:3). In Ps 19:4 (qaw, &quot;Their line is gone out through all the earth&quot;), the reference is probably still to measurement (the heaven as spanning and bounding the earth), though the Septuagint, followed by Ro 10:18, takes it as meaning a musical cord phthoggos). The &quot;line,&quot; as measure, suggests rule of conduct (Isa 28:10). For &quot;line&quot; in Isa 44:13, the Revised Version (British and American) reads &quot;pencil,&quot; margin &quot;red ochre&quot; (seredh), and in 2Co 10:16, &quot;province,&quot; margin &quot;limit&quot; (kanon).See also MEASURING LINE; WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.James Orr</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">lin&#x27;-en (badh, &quot;white linen,&quot; used chiefly for priestly robes, buts, &quot;byssus,&quot; a fine white Egyptian linen, called in the earlier writings shesh; pesheth, &quot;flax,&quot; cadhin; bussos, othonion, linon, sindon): Thread or cloth made of flax.1. History:Ancient Egypt was noted for its fine linen (Ge 41:42; Isa 19:9). From it a large export trade was carried on with surrounding nations, including the Hebrews, who early learned the art of spinning from the Egyptians (Ex 35:25) and continued to rely on them for the finest linen (Pr 7:16; Eze 27:7). The culture of flax in Palestine probably antedated the conquest, for in Jos 2:6 we read of the stalks of flax which Rahab had laid in order upon the roof. Among the Hebrews, as apparently among the Canaanites, the spinning and weaving of linen were carried on by the women (Pr 31:13,19), among whom skill in this work was considered highly praiseworthy (Ex 35:25). One family, the house of Ashbea, attained eminence as workers in linen (1Ch 4:21; 2Ch 2:14).2. General Uses:Linen was used, not only in the making of garments of the finer kinds and for priests, but also for shrouds, hangings, and possibly for other purposes in which the most highly prized cloth of antiquity would naturally be desired.3. Priestly Garments:The robes of the Hebrew priests consisted of 4 linen garments, in addition to which the high priest wore garments of other stuffs (Ex 28; 39; Le 6:10; 16:4; 1Sa 22:18; Eze 44:17,18). Egyptian priests are said to have worn linen robes (Herod. ii.37). In religious services by others than priests, white linen was also preferred, as in the case of the infant Samuel (1Sa 2:18), the Levite singers in the temple (2Ch 5:12), and even royal personages (2Sa 6:14; 1Ch 15:27). Accordingly, it was ascribed to angels (Eze 9:2,3,11; 10:2,6,7; Da 10:5; 12:6,7). Fine linen, white and pure, is the raiment assigned to the armies which are in heaven following Him who is called Faithful and True (Re 19:14). It is deemed a fitting symbol of the righteousness and purity of the saints (Re 19:8).4. Other Garments:Garments of distinction were generally made of the same material: e.g. those which Pharaoh gave Joseph (Ge 41:42), and those which Mordecai wore (Es 8:15; compare also Lu 16:19). Even a girdle of fine linen could be used by a prophet as a means of attracting attention to his message (Jer 13:1). It is probable that linen wrappers of a coarser quality were used by men (Jud 14:12,13) and women (Pr 31:22). The use of linen, however, for ordinary purposes probably suggested unbecoming luxury (Isa 3:23; Eze 16:10,13; compare also Re 18:12,16). The poorer classes probably wore wrappers made either of unbleached flax or hemp (Ecclesiasticus 40:4; Mr 14:51). The use of a mixture called sha&#x27;aTnez, which is defined (De 22:11) as linen and wool together, was forbidden in garments.5. Shrouds:The Egyptians used linen exclusively in wrapping their mummies (Herod. ii.86). As many as one hundred yards were used in one bandage. Likewise,...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">li&#x27;-nus (Linos (2Ti 4:21)): One of Paul&#x27;s friends in Rome during his second and last imprisonment in that city. He was one of the few who remained faithful to the apostle, even when most of the Christians had forsaken him. And writing to Timothy when he realized that his execution could not be very far distant--for he was now ready to be offered, and the time of his departure was at hand (2Ti 4:6)--he sends greeting to Timothy from four friends whom he names, and Linus is one of them. There is a tradition that Linus was bishop of the church at Rome. &quot;It is perhaps fair to assume, though of course there is no certainty of this, that the consecration of Linus to the government of the Roman church as its first bishop was one of the dying acts of the apostle Paul&quot; (H.D.M. Spence, in Ellicott&#x27;s New Testament Commentary on 2 Tim).Irenaeus--bishop of Lyons about 178 AD--in his defense of orthodox doctrine against the Gnostics &quot;appeals especially to the bishops of Rome, as depositories of the apostolic tradition.&quot; The list of Irenaeus commences with Linus, whom he identifies with the person of this name mentioned by Paul, and whom he states to have been &quot;entrusted with the office of the bishopric by the apostles ..... With the many possibilities of error, no more can safely be assumed of Linus .... than that he held some prominent position in the Roman church&quot; (Lightfoot&#x27;s &quot;Dissertation on the Christian Ministry,&quot; in Commentary on Phil, 220 f).&quot;Considering the great rarity of this Greek mythological name as a proper name for persons, we can hardly doubt that here, as Irenaeus has directly asserted, the same Roman Christian is meant who, according to ancient tradition, became after Peter and Paul the first bishop of Rome. Among the mythical characters in Apostolical Constitutions, vii, 46 occurs Linos ho Klaudias, who is declared to have been ordained by Paul as the first bishop of Rome. He is thus represented as the son or husband of the Claudia whose name comes after his in 2Ti 4:21.&quot;These meager statements have been enlarged upon by English investigators. The Claudia mentioned here is, they hold, identical with the one who, according to Martial, married a certain Pudens (85-90 AD), and she, in turn, with the Claudia Rufina from Britain, who is then made out to be a daughter of the British king, Cogidumnus, or Titus Claudius Cogidubnus. For a refutation of these assumptions, which, even chronologically considered, are impossible, see Lightfoot, Clement, I, 76-79&quot; (Zahn, Introduction to the New Testament, 20).John Rutherfurd</p>

Another form, &#x27;ari, plural &#x27;arayim, is found less often.1. Names:Compare &#x27;ari&#x27;el, &quot;Ariel&quot; (Ezr 8:16; Isa 29:1,2,7); char&#x27;el, &quot;upper altar,&quot; and &#x27;ari&#x27;el, &quot;altar hearth&quot; (Eze 43:15); &#x27;aryeh, &quot;Arieh&quot; (2Ki 15:25); &#x27;ar&#x27;eli, &quot;Areli&quot; and &quot;Arelites&quot; (Ge 46:16; Nu 26:17).(2) kephir, &quot;young lion,&quot; often translated &quot;lion&quot; (Ps 35:17; Pr 19:12; 23:1, etc.).(3) shachal, translated &quot;fierce lion&quot; or &quot;lion&quot; (Job 4:10; 10:16; 28:8; Ho 5:14).(4) layish, translated &quot;old lion&quot; or &quot;lion&quot; (Job 4:11; Pr 30:30; Isa 30:6).Compare Arabic laith, &quot;lion&quot;: layish, &quot;Laish,&quot; or &quot;Leshem&quot; (Jos 19:47; Jud 18:7,14,27,29); layish, &quot;Laish&quot; (1Sa 25:44; 2Sa 3:15).(5) lebhi, plural lebha&#x27;im, &quot;lioness&quot;, also labhi&#x27;, and &#x27;lebhiya&#x27; (Ge 49:9; Nu 23:24; 24:9); compare town in South of Judah, Lebaoth (Jos 15:32) or Beth-lebaoth (Jos 19:6); also Arabic labwat, &quot;lioness &quot;; Lebweh, a town in Coele-Syria.(6) aur, gor, &quot;whelp,&quot; with &#x27;aryeh or a pronoun, e.g. &quot;Judah is a lion&#x27;s whelp,&quot; gur &#x27;aryeh (Ge 49:9); &quot;young ones&quot; of the jackal (La 4:3). Also bene labhi&#x27;, &quot;whelps (sons) of the lioness&quot; (Job 4:11); and kephir &#x27;arayoth, &quot;young lion,&quot; literally, &quot;the young of lions&quot; (Jud 14:5). In Job 28:8, the King James Version has &quot;lion&#x27;s whelps&quot; for bene shachats, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;proud beasts.&quot; the Revised Version margin &quot;sons of pride&quot;; compare Job 41:34 (Hebrew 26).(7) leon, &quot;lion&quot; (2Ti 4:17; Heb 11:33; 1Pe 5:8; Re 4:7; 5:5; The Wisdom of Solomon 11:17; Ecclesiasticus 4:30; 13:19; Bel and the Dragon 31,32,34).(8) skumnos, &quot;whelp&quot; (1 Macc 3:4).2. Natural History:The lion is not found in Palestine at the present day, though in ancient times it is known to have inhabited not only Syria and Palestine but also Asia Minor and the Balkan peninsula, and its fossil remains show that it was contemporary with prehistoric man in Northwestern Europe and Great Britain. Its present range extends throughout Africa, and it is also found in Mesopotamia, Southern Persia, and the border of India. There is some reason to think that it may be found in Arabia, but its occurrence there remains to be proved. The Asiatic male lion does not usually have as large a mane as the African, but both belong to one species, Fells leo.3. Figurative:Lions are mentioned in the Bible for their strength (Jud 14:18), boldness (2Sa 17:10), ferocity (Ps 7:2), and stealth (Ps 10:9; La 3:10). Therefore in prophetical references to the millennium, the lion, with the bear, wolf, and leopard, is mentioned as living in peace with the ox, calf, kid, lamb and the child (Ps 91:13; Isa 11:6-8; 65:25). The roaring of the lion is often mentioned (Job 4:10; Ps 104:21; Isa 31:4 (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;growling&quot;); Jer 51:38; Eze 22:25; Ho 11:10). Judah is a &quot;lion&#x27;s whelp&quot; (Ge 49:9), likewise Da (De 33:22). It is said of certain of David&#x27;s warriors (1Ch 12:8) that their &quot;faces were like the faces of lions.&quot; David&#x27;s enemy (Ps 17:12) &quot;is l...</p>

As the lips are the chief instrument of speech, we find numerous idiomatic phrases for &quot;speaking,&quot; such as: &quot;the utterance of the lips&quot; (Nu 30:6,8), &quot;to proceed out of the lips&quot; (Nu 30:12), &quot;to open the lips&quot; (Job 32:20), &quot;to go out of the lips&quot; (Ps 17:1). These expressions do not convey, as a rule, the idea that the utterance proceeds merely out of the lips, and that it lacks sincerity and the consent of the heart, but occasionally this is intended, e.g. &quot;This people draw nigh unto me, and with their mouth and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me&quot; (Isa 29:13; compare Mt 15:8). The &quot;fruit of the lips&quot; (Isa 57:19 equals Heb 13:15) and &quot;calves of the lips&quot; (Ho 14:2 the King James Version) designate the praise and thanksgiving due to God. &quot;Fervent (the King James Version &quot;burning&quot;) lips&quot; (Pr 26:23) are synonymous with eloquence. &quot;To refrain the lips&quot; (Ps 40:9; Pr 10:19) means to keep silence, where the godless or unwise would wish to assert his rights.Numerous other expressions need no further explanation, such as &quot;perverse lips&quot; (Pr 4:24), &quot;uncircumcised lips&quot; (Ex 6:12,30), &quot;feigned lips&quot; (Ps 17:1), &quot;lying lips&quot; (Ps 31:18; Pr 10:18; 12:22), &quot;wicked (or false) lips&quot; (Pr 17:4), &quot;unclean lips&quot; (Isa 6:5), &quot;strange (the King James Version &quot;stammering&quot;) lips&quot; (Isa 28:11), &quot;flattering lips&quot; (Ps 12:2,3; Pr 7:21), &quot;righteous lips&quot; (Pr 16:13).(2) The Hebrew word sapham is found only in the phrase &quot;to cover the lip or lips,&quot; which is an expression of mourning, submission and shame. The Oriental covers his lips with his hand or a portion of his garment, when he has been sunk into deep grief and sorrow. He expresses, thereby, that he cannot open his mouth at the visitation of God. Differently, however, from common mourners, Ezekiel was forbidden of God &quot;to cover his lips&quot; (Eze 24:17; see also Eze 24:22), i.e. to mourn in the usual way over Israel&#x27;s downfall, as Israel had brought these judgments upon himself. The leper, victim of an incurable disease, walks about with rent clothes and hair disheveled, covering his lips, crying: &quot;Unclean, unclean!&quot; (Le 13:45). The thought here is that even the breath of such a one may defile. The prophet calls upon all seers and diviners, to whom God has refused the knowledge of the future, to cover their lips in shame and confusion (Mic 3:7).H. L. E. Luering</p>

ContentsLITERATUREThe Sub-apostolic Age is usually held to extend from the death of John, the last surviving apostle, about 100 AD, to the death of Polycarp, John&#x27;s aged disciple (155-56 AD). The Christian literature of this period, although as a whole of only moderate intrinsic value, is of historical interest and importance. This is owing to the light which it throws back on apostolic times, and the testimony borne to Christian life, thought, worship, work and organization during an age when the church was under the guidance, mainly, of men who had been associated with the apostles and who might be supposed, therefore, to know their mind. Some writings are omitted from this review, having been dealt with in previous articles. For the Protevangelium of James and the Gospel and Apocalypse of Peter see APOCRYPHAL GOSPELS; APOCRYPHAL ACTS. For an account of extant fragments of Basilides and Valentinus, see GNOSTICISM. For pseudo-Clementine writings see PETER, EPISTLES OF; SIMON MAGUS.I. Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians.1. Authorship and Date:Only the larger part had previously been extant, when the complete epistle was recovered in 1875 by Bryennios, bishop of Nicomedia. The high honor in which it was held by early Christendom is attested(1) by its position in Codex Alexandrinus, at the end of the New Testament, and in an ancient Syriac MS, between the Catholic and Pauline Epistles;(2) by its being publicly read in many churches down to the 4th century.(Historia Ecclesiastica, III, 16). The work is anonymous, but sent in the name of the Roman church. Dionysius of Corinth (170 AD) refers to it as written by the agency of (dia) Clement (Historia Ecclesiastica, IV, 23); Clement of Alexandria states distinctly the Clementine authorship (Strom., iv.17). The writer is evidently leading office-bearer of his church, and is identified with the Clement w...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">liv&#x27;-er (qabhedh, derived from a root meaning &quot;to be heavy,&quot; being the heaviest of the viscera; Septuagint hepar): The word is usually joined with the Hebrew yothereth (see CAUL) (Ex 29:13,22; Le 9:10,19) as a special portion set aside for the burnt offering.This represents the large lobe or flap of the liver, Lobos tou hepatos (thus, Septuagint and Josephus, Ant, III, ix, 2, (228)). Others, however, interpret it as the membrane which covers the upper part of the liver, sometimes called the &quot;lesser omenturn.&quot; Thus, the Vulgate: reticulurn iecoris. It extends from the fissures of the liver to the curve of the stomach. Still others consider it to be the &quot;fatty mass at the opening of the liver, which reaches to the kidneys and becomes visible upon the removal of the lesser omentum or membrane&quot; (Driver and White, Leviticus, 65).As in the scholastic psychology of the Middle Ages, the liver played an important part in the science of Semitic peoples. It was the seat of feeling, and thus became synonymous with temper, disposition, character (compare Assyrian kabittu, &quot;liver&quot;, &quot;temper,&quot; &quot;character,&quot; and Arabic kabid, vulgar kibdi). Thus, Jeremiah expresses his profound grief with the words: &quot;My liver is poured upon the earth, because of the destruction of the daughter of my people&quot; (La 2:11). The liver is also considered one of the most important and vital parts of the body (compare Virgil, cerebrum, iecur domicilia vitae). A hurt in it is equivalent to death. So we find the fate of a man enticed by the flattering of a loose woman compared to that of the ox that &quot;goeth to the slaughter .... till an arrow strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life&quot; (Pr 7:22,23; the rest of the verse is obscure as to its meaning).In a few passages of the Old Testament, kabhedh (&quot;liver&quot;) and kabhodh (&quot;glory&quot;) have been confounded, and we are in uncertainty as to the right translation Several authors, to give but one example, would read kabhedh in Ps 16:9, for reasons of Hebrew poetical parallelism: &quot;Therefore my heart is glad and my liver (English Versions of the Bible, &quot;glory&quot;) rejoiceth.&quot; While this is quite possible, it is not easy to decide, as according to Jewish interpretation &quot;my glory&quot; is synonymous with &quot;my soul,&quot; which would present as proper a parallelism.The liver has always played an important role in heathen divination, of which we have many examples in old and modern times among the Greeks, Etrurians, Romans and now among African tribes. The prophet Ezekiel gives us a Biblical instance. The king of Babylon, who had been seeking to find out whether he should attack Jerusalem, inquired by shaking &quot;arrows to and fro, he consulted the teraphim, he looked in the liver&quot; (Eze 21:21 (Hebrew 21:26); compare Tobit 6:4 ff; 8:2).See ASTROLOGY, 3; DIVINATION.H.

In Pr 30:28, we find(9) semamith, the King James Version &quot;spider,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;lizard.&quot;Since (1), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) occur as names of animals only in this passage, and as the philological evidence available is in most cases not very convincing, their determination is difficult and uncertain. the Revised Version margin to &quot;gecko&quot; (Le 11:30) has &quot;Words of uncertain meaning, but probably denoting four kinds of lizards.&quot;2. Lizards of Palestine:Among the many lizards of Palestine, the monitor and thorny-tailed lizard are remarkable for their size, and the chameleon for its striking appearance and habits. On etymological grounds, koach, the King James Version &quot;chameleon,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;land-crocodile,&quot; Septuagint chamaileon, has been taken to be the monitor; tsabh, the King James Version &quot;tortoise,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;great lizard,&quot; Septuagint krokodeilos chersaios, to be the thorny-tailed lizard; and tinshemeth, the King James Version &quot;mole,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;chameleon,&quot; Septuagint aspalax, to be the chameleon. On the same grounds, choledh, English Versions of the Bible &quot;weasel,&quot; Septuagint gale, might be the mole-rat.See CHAMELEON; TORTOISE; WEASEL.The commonest lizard of Palestine is the rough-tailed agama, Agama stellio, Arabic chirdaun or chirdaun, which is everywhere in evidence, running about on the ground, rocks or walls, frequently lying still basking in the sun, or bobbing its head up and down in the peculiar manner that it has.  The gecko, Ptyodactylus lobatus, is common in houses. By means of adhesive disks on the under sides of its toes, it clings with ease to smooth walls which other lizards cannot scale. Although perfectly harmless, it is believed to be poisonous, and is much feared. It is called abu-brais, &quot;father of leprosy,&quot; either on account of its supposed poisonous qualities or because it has a semi-transparent and sickly appearance, being of a whitish-yellow color with darker spots. It utters a little cry, which may be the...</p>

An earlier child, a daughter, had been named Lo-ruhamah (lo&#x27;-ruchamah, &quot;uncompassionated&quot;). The names, like those given by Isaiah to his children, are symbolic, and set forth Hosea&#x27;s conviction that Israel has, through sin, forfeited Yahweh&#x27;s compassion, and can no longer claim His protection. Of the bearers of these names nothing further is known; but their symbolism is alluded to in Ho 2:1,23. This latter passage is quoted by Paul (Ro 9:25 f).See HOSEA; JEZREEL.John A. Lees</p>

This same Machir met David with supplies when he fled to Gilead from Absalom (2Sa 17:27 f). Possibly it is the same place as Lidebir in Jos 13:26 (Revised Version margin). No certain identification is possible; but Schumacher (Northern &#x27;Ajlun, 101) found a site with the name Ibdar about 6 1/2 miles East of Umm Qeis, North of the great aqueduct, which may possibly represent the ancient city. Lidebir, at least, seems to be placed on the northern boundary of Gilead. The modern village stands on the southern shoulder of Wady Samar. There is a good spring to the East, a little lower down, while ancient remains are found in the neighborhood.W. Ewing</p>

Once it is applied to a forelock of hair. The prophet Ezekiel, describing his sensations which accompanied his vision of Jerusalem, says: &quot;He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerus&quot; (Eze 8:3).(2) The word pera` signifies the uncut and disheveled locks of the Nazirite (Nu 6:5) or of the priests, the sons of Zadok (Eze 44:20).(3) The Book of Judges employs the word machlaphah when speaking of the &quot;seven locks&quot; of Samson (Jud 16:13,19), which really represent the plaited (etymologically, &quot;interwoven&quot;) strands of hair still worn in our days by youthful Bedouin warriors.(4) Qewutstsah (So 5:2,11) means the luxuriant hair of the Hebrew youth, who was careful of his exterior. It is called bushy (the Revised Version margin &quot;curling&quot;) and black as a raven. the King James Version translations also the word tsammah with &quot;locks&quot; (So 4:1; 6:7; Isa 47:2), but the Revised Version (British and American) has corrected this into &quot;veil,&quot; leaving the word &quot;locks&quot; in So 4:1 margin.H.

Identifications:(1), (2), (3) and (4) constitute the list of clean insects in Le 11:21 f, characterized as &quot;winged creeping things that go upon all fours, which have legs above their feet, wherewith to leap upon the earth.&quot; This manifestly refers to jumping insects of the order Orthoptera, such as locusts, grasshoppers and crickets, and is in contrast to the unclean &quot;winged creeping things that go upon all fours,&quot; which may be taken to denote running Orthoptera, such as cockroaches, mole-crickets and ear-wigs, as well as insects of other orders.&#x27;Arbeh (1) is uniformly translated &quot;locust&quot; in the Revised Version (British and American). the King James Version has usually &quot;locust,&quot; but &quot;grasshopper&quot; in Jud 6:5; 7:12; Job 39:20; Jer 46:23. Septuagint has usually akris, &quot;locust&quot;; but has brouchos, &quot;wingless locust,&quot; in Le 11:22; 1Ki 8:37 (akris in the parallel passage, 2Ch 6:28); Na 3:15; and attelebos, &quot;wingless locust,&quot; in Na 3:17. &#x27;Arbeh occurs (Ex 10:4-19) in the account of the plague of locusts; in the phrase &quot;as locusts for multitude&quot; (Jud 6:5; 7:12); &quot;more than the locusts .... innumerable&quot; (Jer 46:23);&quot;The locusts have no king,Yet go they forth all of them by bands&quot; (Pr 30:27).&#x27;Arbeh is referred to as a plague in De 28:38; 1Ki 8:37; 2Ch 6:28; Ps 78:46; in Joe and in Nahum. These references, together with the fact that it is the most used word, occurring 24 times, warrant us in assuming it to be one of the swarming species, i.e. Pachtylus migratorius or Schistocerca peregrina, which from time to time devastate large regions in the countries bordering on the Mediterranean.Cal`am (2), English Versions of the Bible &quot;bald locust,&quot; occurs only in Le 11:22.

Scriptural Notices:Ono and Lod and the towns thereof are said to have been built by Shemed, a Benjamite (1Ch 8:12). The children of Lod, Hadid and One, to the number of 725, returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel (Ezr 2:33; Ne 7:37 (721)). The town lay in the Shephelah, perhaps in ge ha-charashim, &quot;the valley of craftsmen&quot; (Ne 11:35). In the New Testament it appears as Lydda. Here the apostle Peter visited the saints and healed the palsied Arenas (Ac 9:32). Hence he was summoned by messengers from Joppa on the death of Dorcas.2. History from Maccabean Times:The three governments of Aphaerema, Lydda and Ramathaim were added to Judea from the country of Samaria by King Demetrius II (1 Macc 11:34). Lydda presided over one of the toparchies under Jerusalem, into which Judea was divided (BJ, III, iii, 5). After the death of Julius Caesar the inhabitants of Lydda and certain other towns, having failed to pay the contributions Cassius demanded, were by him sold into slavery. They were freed by Antony (Ant., XIV, xi, 2; xii, 2). Lydda suffered severely under Cestius Gallus (BJ, II, xix, 1). Along with Jamnia it surrendered to Vespasian (BJ, IV, viii, 1). After the fall of Jerusalem it was noted as a seat of rabbinical learning. The classical name of the city was Diospolis. In the 4th century it was connected with the trade in purple. It became the seat of a bishopric, and the bishop of Lydda was present at the Council of Nicea. At Lydda, in 415 AD, took place the trial of Pelagius for heresy.Under the Moslems it became capital of the province of Filastin but later it was superseded by er-Ramleh, founded by Khalif Suleiman, whither its inhabitants were removed ( Ya&#x27;kubi, circa 891 AD). Mukaddasi (circa 985) says that in Lydda &quot;there is a great mosque in which are wont to assemble large numbers of people from the capital (er-Ramleh) and from the villages around. In Lydda, too, is that wonderful church (of George) at the gate of which Christ will slay the antichrist&quot; (quoted by Guy le Strange, Palestine under the Moslems, 493). It was rebuilt by the Crusaders; but was destroyed by Saladin after the battle of ChaTTin, 1191 AD. It was again restored; but in 1271 it was sacked by the Mengels, and from this blow it has never recovered.3. Identification and Description:The ancient Lod or Lydda is represented by the modern village of Ludd, on the road to Jerusalem, about 11 miles Southeast of Yafa. It is a station on the Jaffa-Jerusalem Railway. It occupies a picturesque hollow in the plain of Sharon, and is surrounded by gardens and orchards, the beauty of which intensifies by contrast the squalor of the village. It was the reputed birthplace of George, and here he is said to have been buried. The one ruin of importance in the place is that of the church which perpetuates his name.The town stood on the great caravan road between Babylon and Egypt, near its intersection with that from Joppa to Jerusalem and the East. Its position on these great ar...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">1. The Word &quot;Logia&quot; and Its History:The word logion, which is a diminutive of logos, was regularly used of Divine utterances. There are examples in the classics, the Septuagint, the writings of Josephus and Philo and in four passages in the New Testament (Ac 7:38; Ro 3:2; Heb 5:12; 1Pe 4:11) where it is uniformly rendered both in the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;oracles.&quot; It is not, therefore, surprising that early Christian writers, who thought of Christ as Divine, applied this term to His sayings also. We find this use, according to the usual interpretation, in the title of the lost work of Papias as preserved by Eusebius, Logion kuriakon exegesis, &quot;Exposition of the Lord&#x27;s Logia&quot; (Historia Ecclesiastica, III, 39), in that writer&#x27;s obscure reference to a Hebrew or Aramaic writing by the apostle Matthew (same place) , and in Polycarp&#x27;s Epistle (section symbol 7), &quot;the logia of the Lord.&quot; The modern use of the word is twofold:(a) as the name of the document referred to by Papins which may or may not be the Q of recent inquirers;(b) as the name of recently discovered sayings ascribed to Jesus. For the former compare GOSPELS.The latter is theme of this article.2. The Discovery of the Logia:About 9 1/2 miles from the railway station of Beni Mazar, 121 miles from Cairo, a place now called Behnesa marks the site of an ancient city named by the Greeks Oxyrhynchus, from the name of a sacred fish, the modern binni, which had long been known as a great Christian center in early times and was therefore selected by Messrs. Grenfell and Hunt for exploration in behalf of the Egyptian Exploration Fund. They began work on the ruins of the town, January 11, 1897, and on the following day discovered a papyrus leaf inscribed with a number of sayings introduced by the formula legei Iesous, &quot;saith Jesus,&quot; some of which were at once seen to be quite new. When excavation was resumed in February, 1903, a second fragment was discovered, which must have belonged to the same or a similar collection, as the formula &quot;saith Jesus&quot; is employed in exactly the same way, and the sayings exhibit the same mixed character. The first of these two fragments was named by the discoverers logia, but the short preface to the second fragment suggests that the word used in the original title may have been logoi, which is found in Ac 20:35 as the title perhaps of a collection of sayings of Jesus used by the apostle Paul. It is convenient, however, to retain logia, at any rate for the present. Other remains of early Christian texts have been found on the same site (compare AGRAPHA) but none of precisely the same character.3. Description of the Texts:The first fragment, found and published in 1897, afterward referred to as A, is a leaf from a papyrus book measuring in its present state 5 3/4 X 3 3/4 inches and having 42 lines on the two pages. As it is broken at the bottom it is impossible, in the absence of another leaf, to ascertain or even conjecture h...</p>

PATRISTIC DEVELOPMENTLITERATUREThe doctrine of the Logos has exerted a decisive and far-reaching influence upon speculative and Christian thought. The word has a long history, and the evolution of the idea it embodies is really the unfolding of man&#x27;s conception of God. To comprehend the relation of the Deity to the world has been the aim of all religious philosophy. While widely divergent views as to the Divine manifestation have been conceived, from the dawn of Western speculation, the Greek word logos has been employed with a certain degree of uniformity by a series of thinkers to express and define the nature and mode of God&#x27;s revelation.Logos signifies in classical Greek both &quot;reason&quot; and &quot;word.&quot; Though in Biblical Greek the term is mostly employed in the sense of &quot;word,&quot; we cannot properly dissociate the two significations. Every word implies a thought. It is impossible to imagine a time when God was without thought. Hence, thought must be eternal as the Deity. The translation &quot;thought&quot; is probably the best equivalent for the Greek term, since it denotes, on the one hand, the faculty of reason, or the thought inwardly conceived in the mind; and, on the other hand, the thought outwardly expressed through the vehicle of language. The two ideas, thought and speech, are indubitably blended in the term logos; and in every employment of the word, in philosophy and Scripture, both notions of thought and its outward expression are intimately connected.In this article it will be our aim to trace the evolution of the doctrine from its earliest appearance in Greek philosophy through its Hebrew and Alexandrian phases till it attained its richest expression in the writings of the New Testament, and especially in the Fourth Gospel.The doctrine may be said to have two stages: a Hellenistic and a Hebrew; or, more correctly, a pre-Christian and a Christian. The theory of Philo and of the Alexandrian thinkers generally may be regarded as the connecting link between the Greek and the Christian forms of the doctrine. The Greek or pre-Christian speculation on the subject is marked by the names of Heraclitus, Plato and the Stoics. Philo paves the way for the Christian doctrine of Paul, Hebrews and the Johannine Gospel.I. Greek Speculation.The earliest speculations of the Greeks were occupied with the world of Nature, and the first attempts at philosophy take the shape of a search for some unitary principle to explain the diversity of...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">loinz (chalats, Aramaic charats, mothen, kecel, yarekh; osphus): This variety of Hebrew synonyms seems to be used rather promiscuously for the loins, though there is no little difference in the secondary meanings of these words. They represent various modes of expressing the loins as the seat of strength and vigor (Job 40:16, Hebrew mothen, here used of Behemoth), the center of procreative power, the portion of the body which is girded about, and is considered as specially needful of covering, even under primitive conditions of life (Job 31:20), and where painful disease most effectually unfits a man for work and warfare.Jacob receives the Divine promise that &quot;kings shall come out of (his) loins&quot; (chalats, Ge 35:11), and we read of 66 souls &quot;that came out of his loins&quot; (yarekh) which went into Egypt (Ge 46:26). The Epistle to the Hebrews speaks of the Levites as having come out of the loins of Abraham (Heb 7:5).As the seat of strength (compare LEG; THIGH), the loins are girded with belts of leather (2Ki 1:8; Mt 3:4), or cloth, often beautifully embroidered (Ex 28:39), or of costly material (Ex 39:29; Jer 13:1 f). Girded loins are a sign of readiness for service or endeavor (Ex 12:11; 1Ki 18:46; 2Ki 4:29; Job 38:3; Pr 31:17; Lu 12:35; 1Pe 1:13). Of God it is said that &quot;he looseth the bond of kings, and bindeth their loins with a girdle,&quot; i.e. strengthens them (Job 12:18). On the loins the sword is worn (2Sa 20:8). It is a sign of mourning to gird the loins with sackcloth (1Ki 20:32; Isa 32:11; Jer 48:37; Am 8:10; see also the First Papyrus of Elephantine, l. 20). A man whose strength is in his attachment to truth, in other words is faithful, is spoken of as having his loins girt about with truth (Eph 6:14). Thus, the Messiah is described: &quot;Righteousness shall be the girdle of his waist, and faithfulness the girdle of his loins&quot; (Isa 11:5). One of the most primitive modes of clothing consisted of a fleece tied around the loins (Job 31:20).The condition of unfitness for service is described in that the loins (kecel) are filled with a burning (Ps 38:7, the King James Version &quot;loathsome disease&quot;), or that &quot;a sore burden&quot; is laid upon the &quot;loins&quot; (mothen, Ps 66:11). Thus the loins are made &quot;continually to shake&quot; (Ps 69:23), &quot;the joints of (the) loins&quot; (charats) are loosed (Da 5:6), the &quot;loins are filled with anguish&quot; (Isa 21:3). It is very likely that originally a disabling lumbago or the painful affections of the gall or the bladder (calculus, etc.) are meant, but very soon the expression becomes merely metaphorical to express personal helplessness, especially that which can but rely upon assistance and help from God.H.

The family lived at Lystra (Ac 16:1). It was on the occasion of Paul&#x27;s first missionary journey (Ac 14) that Eunice and Timothy were converted to Christ, and it was, in all likelihood, on the same occasion that Lois also became a Christian. Paul speaks of the unfeigned faith that there was in Timothy, and he adds that this faith dwelt at the first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice. This is the only passage where Lois is mentioned; but by comparing 2Ti 1:5 with 2Ti 3:15 (the King James Version), where Paul refers to Timothy&#x27;s having &quot;from a child known the holy scriptures,&quot; it would appear that Lois was associated with Eunice, both in a reverent faith in God and in the careful instruction in the Old Testament which was given to Timothy.See EUNICE; TIMOTHY.John Rutherfurd</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">lon-jev&#x27;-i-ti: In the part of Genesis ascribed to the Priestly Code (P), the names and genealogies of the patriarchs are given (Ge 5; 11). In the three versions which are our chief sources, Massoretic Text, Septuagint and Sam, the age-numbers given for these patriarchs are hopelessly at variance. It is in accord with what we find in the earliest legend of most races that in these chapters a great length of life is ascribed to these; thus Berosus attributes to the first 10 kings of Babylonia a span of 430,000 years, and Hesiod (Works and Days, 129) says that in the Silver Age childhood lasted 100 years, during which a boy was reared and grew up beside his mother. On the other hand the evidence of prehistoric archaeology shows that the rate of development of the individual in the early Stone Age differed very little from that of humanity at the present day. It is possible that, in the case of the Hebrew record, the names of certain pre-Abrahamic patriarchs were derived from an ancient tradition, and that in the desire to fill up the chronology of the period before the call of Abraham, these names were inserted and the time which was supposed to have elapsed was divided among them; on the basis of some such hypothesis as that which is said to have existed among the Jews, that the Messiah should come 4,000 years after Adam.We know from the archaeological evidence that the antiquity of primitive man extends to a date very much farther back than 4,000 years. Indeed, we can prove that before 4000 BC there were settled nationalities both in the valley of the Nile and that of the Euphrates, and that among these the duration of individual life was much the same as at the present day. The first three dynasties in Egypt, starting at or about 4400 BC, consisted of 25 consecutive kings, the average length of whose several reigns was about 30 years. The biographic sketches of Biblical persons other than those in Genesis showed that their longevity did not exceed that of our contemporaries. Eli was blind and feeble at 98. At 70 David was bedridden and frail. Manasseh, the king of Judah whose reign was longest, died at 67; Uzziah died at 68. The statement in Ps 90:10 attributed to Moses is a correct estimate of what has been the expectation of life at all time.At the present day among Palestinian fellahin very old men are uncommon. I have never seen anyone among them who could prove that he was 80 years of age; the rate of infant mortality is appallingly high. Maturity is earlier, and signs of senility appear among them sooner than among the same class in Great Britain.Alexander Macalister</p>

It is attributed to God (Ro 2:4; 9:22; 2Pe 3:9), of His bearing long with sinners and slowness to execute judgment on them. It is, therefore, one of &quot;the fruits of the Spirit&quot; in man (Ga 5:22) which Christians are frequently exhorted to cherish and show one toward the other (Eph 4:2; Col 1:11; 3:12, etc.); it belongs, Paul says, to the love, without which all else is nothing: &quot;Love suffereth long (makrothumei), and is kind&quot; (1Co 13:4); The verb makrothumeo is sometimes translated by &quot;patience&quot; (Mt 18:26,29, &quot;Have patience with me&quot;). Lu 18:7 has been variously rendered; the King James Version has &quot;And shall not God avenge his own elect .... though he bear long with them&quot;; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;and yet he is longsuffering over them,&quot; the American Revised Version margin &quot;and is he slow to punish on their behalf?&quot; Weymouth (New Testament in Modern Speech) has &quot;although he seems slow in taking action on their behalf,&quot; which most probably gives the sense of the passage; in Jas 5:7,8 the verb occurs thrice, the King James Version &quot;be patient,&quot; &quot;hath long patience&quot;; the Revised Version (British and American) also translates by &quot;patient&quot;; this, however, as in Mt 18:26,29, seems to lose the full force of the Greek word. According to Trench (Synonyms of the New Testament, 189), the difference between hupomone (&quot;patience&quot;) and makrothumia is that the latter word expresses patience in respect to persons, and the former in respect to things; hence, hupomone is never ascribed to God; where He is called &quot;the God of patience,&quot; it is as He gives it to His servants and saints. But in Jas 5:7 it is used with reference to things, and in Col 1:11 it is associated with patience (compare He...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">look:(1) The uses of the simple verb in English Versions of the Bible are nearly all good modern English. In Isa 5:2, however, &quot;He looked that it should bring forth grapes&quot;--&quot;look&quot; is used in the sense of &quot;expect.&quot; Compare the King James Version of Sirach 20:14; Ac 28:6, &quot;They looked when he should have swollen&quot; (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;They expected that he would have swollen&quot;). In 1 Macc 4:54, the King James Version has inserted &quot;look&quot; (omitted in the Revised Version (British and American)) as a simple interjection, without a corresponding word in the Greek(2) &quot;Look upon&quot; means &quot;fix one&#x27;s attention on,&quot; and is often so used in English Versions of the Bible without further significance (Ec 2:11; Lu 22:56, etc.); but in 2Ch 24:22 the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American), &quot;Yahweh look upon it&quot; means &quot;remember.&quot; However, continual attention given to an object usually denotes that pleasure is found in it, and from this fact such uses as those of Pr 23:31, &quot;Look not thou upon the wine when it is red,&quot; are derived. In particular, God&#x27;s &quot;looking upon&quot; a person becomes a synonym for &quot;showing favor unto,&quot; as in De 26:7 the King James Version; Ps 84:9 the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American); Ps 119:132 the King James Version; Lu 1:48 the Revised Version (British and American) only, etc. (the Revised Version (British and American) usually, re-words, in such passages). On the other hand, &quot;look on&quot; may be weakened, as in such phrases as &quot;fair to look unon&quot; (Ge 12:11 etc.), where it means only &quot;fair to the sight.&quot; Or as in modern English, &quot;look on&quot; may describe the attitude of the passive spectator, even when applied to God. So Ps 35:17, &quot;Lord, how long wilt thou look on?&quot;(3) &quot;Look to&quot; usually means &quot;pay attention to,&quot; as in Pr 14:15; Jer 39:12; 2 Joh 1:8, etc., and the Revised Version (British and American) occasionally uses this phrase in place of AV&#x27;s &quot;look upon&quot; (Php 2:4). The reverse change is made in the King James Version&#x27;s 1Sa 16:12, &quot;goodly to look to&quot;; Eze 23:15, &quot;all of them princes to look to,&quot; but in the latter verse a more drastic revision was needed, for the meaning is &quot;all of them in appearance as princes.&quot; &quot;Look out&quot; may mean &quot;search for&quot; (Ge 41:33; Ac 6:3), but may also be used literally, (Ge 26:8, etc.). The King James Version&#x27;s &quot;looking after those things&quot; in Lu 21:26 has been changed by the Revised Version (British and American) into &quot;expectation of the things.&quot; &quot;Look one another in the face&quot; in 2Ki 14:8,11 means &quot;meet in battle.&quot;Burton Scott Easton</p>

Linguistic:Formerly it was supposed that the adjective kuriakos (translated &quot;the Lord&#x27;s&quot;) was a purely Christian word, but recent discoveries have proved that it was in fairly common use in the Roman Empire before Christian influence had been felt. In secular use it signified &quot;imperial,&quot; &quot;belonging to the lord&quot;--the emperor--and so its adoption by Christianity in the sense &quot;belonging to the Lord&quot;--to Christ--was perfectly easy. Indeed, there is reason to suppose that in the days of Domitian, when the issue had been sharply defined as &quot;Who is Lord? Caesar or Christ?&quot; the use of the adjective by the church was a part of the protest against Caesar-worship (see LORD). And it is even possible that the full phrase, &quot;the Lord&#x27;s day,&quot; was coined as a contrast to the phrase, &quot;the Augustean day&quot; he sebaste hemera), a term that seems to have been used in some parts of the Empire to denote days especially dedicated in honor of Caesar-worship.2. Post-Apostolic:&quot;Lord&#x27;s day&quot; in the New Testament occurs only in Re 1:10, but in the post-apostolic literature we have the following references: Ignatius, Ad Mag., ix.1, &quot;No longer keeping the Sabbath but living according to the Lord&#x27;s day, on which also our Light arose&quot;; Ev. Pet., verse 35, &quot;The Lord&#x27;s day began to dawn&quot; (compare Mt 28:1); verse 50, &quot;early on the Lord&#x27;s day&quot; (compare Lu 24:1); Barn 15 9, &quot;We keep the eighth day with gladness,&quot; on which Jesus arose from the dead.&quot; I.e. Sunday, as the day of Christ&#x27;s resurrection, was kept as a Christian feast and called &quot;the Lord&#x27;s day,&quot; a title fixed so definitely as to be introduced by the author of Ev. Pet. into phrases from the canonical Gospels. Its appropriateness in Re 1:10 is obvious, as John received his vision of the exalted Lord when all Christians had their minds directed toward His entrance into glory through the resurrection.3. In the New Testament:This &quot;first day of the week&quot; appears again in Ac 20:7 as the day on which the worship of the &quot;breaking of bread&quot; took place, and the impression given by the context is that Paul and his companions prolonged their visit to Troas so as to join in the service. Again, 1Co 16:2 contains the command, &quot;Upon the first day of the week let each one of you lay by him in store,&quot; where the force of the form of the imperative used (the present for repeated action) would be better represented in English by &quot;lay by on the successive Sundays.&quot; Worship is here not explicitly mentioned (the Greek of &quot;by him&quot; is the usual phrase for &quot;at home&quot;), but that the appropriateness of the day for Christian acts involves an appropriateness for Christian worship is not to be doubted. Indeed, since the seven-day week was unknown to Greek thought, some regular observance of a hebdomadal cycle must have been settled at Corinth before Paul could write his command. Finally, the phrase, &quot;first day in the week&quot; is found elsewhere in the New Testament only in Mt 28:1; Mr 16:2; Lu 24:1; Joh 20:1,19. The word in all passages for...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(Mt 6:9-13; Lu 11:2-4): Prayer occupied an important place in the life and the teachings of Jesus. He was emphatically a man of prayer, praying frequently in private and in public, and occasionally spending whole nights in communion with His heavenly Father. He often spoke to His disciples on the subject of prayer, cautioning them against ostentation, or urging perseverance, faith and large expectation, and He gave them a model of devotion in the Lord&#x27;s prayer.1. Twofold Form:This prayer is given by the evangelists in two different forms and in two entirely different con nections. In Matthew&#x27;s account the prayer is given as a part of the Sermon on the Mount and in connection with a criticism of the ostentation usual in the prayers of the hypocrites and the heathen. Lu introduces the prayer after the Galilean ministry and represents it as given in response to a request from one of His disciples, &quot;Lord teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.&quot; It gives us, however, no note of time or place, and it is quite possible that the incident which it records took place much earlier. The later form is much shorter than that of Mt and the common parts differ materially in language.In view of the differences, the reader instinctively inquires whether the prayer was given on two different occasions in these different connections, or the evangelists have presented the same incident in forms derived from different sources, or modified the common source to suit their immediate purposes.If the prayer was given only on one occasion, there is little doubt that Luke preserves the true historical circumstances, though not necessarily the accurate point of time or place, or the exact form of language. Such a request made at the close of the prayer of Jesus would be natural, and the incident bears every mark of reality. On the other hand, it would be reasonable to assume that the author of Matthew&#x27;s source, remembering the incident, incorporated the prayer in the Sermon on the Mount as an illustration of the injunctions concerning prayer.There are many reasons for regarding the Sermon as a collection of sayings spoken on different occasions and summarized for convenience in teaching and memorizing. There is, however, no proof that the prayer was given but once by Jesus. We need not suppose that His disciples were always the same, and we know that He gave instruction in prayer on various occasions. He may have given the model prayer on one occasion spontaneously and at another time on the request of a disciple. It is probable that the two evangelists, using the same or different sources, presented the prayer in such connection as best suited the plan of their narratives. In any case, it is rather remarkable that the prayer is not quoted or directly mentioned anywhere else in the New Testament.2. Arrangement:In addition to the opening salutation, &quot;Our Father who art in heaven,&quot; the Lord&#x27;s Prayer consists of six petitions. These are arranged in three equal parts. In ...</p>

The Early Fathers(1) Ignatian Epistles(2) Justin Martyr(3) Irenaeus(4) CyprianVIII. LITURGICAL TRADITION1. Outline of Eucharistic Prayer2. Significance of This for UnityLITERATUREI. Definition.Eucharist.--The distinctive rite of Christian worship, instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ upon the eve of His atoning death, being a religious partaking of bread and wine, which, having been presented before God the Father in thankful memorial of Christ&#x27;s inexhaustible sacrifice, have become (through the sacramental blessing) the communion of the body and blood of Christ (compare Joh 6:54; Ac 2:42; 20:7,11; Ro 15:16; 1Co 10:16; 11:23-26).II. New Testament Sources.The New Testament sources of our knowledge of the institution of the Eucharist are fourfold, a brief account thereof being found in each of the Synoptic Gospels and in Paul&#x27;s First Epistle to the Corinthians (Mt 26:26-29; Mr 14:22-25; Lu 22:14-20; 1Co 11:23-26; compare 10:16,17).1. Textual Considerations:The text of these narratives has been found to need little amendment, save the dropping of a word or two, from each account, that had crept in through the tendency of copyists, consciously or unconsciously, to assimilate the details of parallel passages. The genuineness of Lu 22:19,20 is absolutely beyond question. Their omission in whole or part, and the alterations in the order of two or three verses in the whole section (22:14-20), characteristic of a very small number of manuscripts, are due to confusion in the minds of a few scribes and translators, between the paschal cup (22:17) and the eucharistic cup (22:20), and to their well-meant, but mistaken, attempt to improve upon the text before them.2. Narratives Compared:(1) Mark:The briefest account of the institution of the Eucharist is found in Mr 14:22-24. In it the Eucharist is not sharply distinguished from its setting, the paschal meal: &quot;And as they were eating, he took bread, and when he had blessed, he brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take ye: this is my body. And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them: and they all drank of it. And he said unto them, This is my bloo...</p>

Despotes, of men in classic usage, occurs only of God, including the ascended Jesus, and is employed only 5 times. Megistanes (plural) is found once, of men (Mr 6:21). Rabboni (Hebrew in Greek letters) is applied only to the Christ, and is simply transliterated in the Revised Version (British and American), but rendered &quot;Lord&quot; in the King James Version (compare Mr 10:51).Our English versions distinguish the 3 main uses of the term thus:(1) &quot;LORD&quot; represents the Hebrew Yahweh, Septuagint Kurios, except where &#x27;Adhonay or &#x27;Adhon is combined with Yahweh (= &quot;Lord God&quot;); the American Standard Revised Version has in these examples employed the name as it is found in the Hebrew, simply transliterated.(2) &quot;Lord&quot; corresponds to &#x27;Adhonay, &#x27;Adhon, Mare&#x27;, also Greek Kurios (see (1)), and Despotes, for which the American Standard Revised Version has always &quot;Master&quot; in either the text or the margin.(3) &quot;Lord&quot; (&quot;lord&quot;) translates all the remaining 8 Hebrew words and the Greek words except Despotes. It is thus seen that Kurios corresponds to all three forms of writing the English term.See JEHOVAH.William Owen Carver</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">lot:I. Personality.The man who bore the name Lot (lot; Lot) is mentioned for the first time in Ge 11:27, at the beginning of that section of Genesis which is entitled &quot;the generations of Terah.&quot; After Terah&#x27;s 3 sons are named, it is added that the third of these, Haran, begat Lot.The reason for thus singling out but one of the grandsons of Terah appears in the next verse, where we are told that &quot;Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.&quot; For that period in the life of this family, therefore, which begins with the migration from Ur, Lot represents his father&#x27;s branch of the family (Ge 11:31). It is hardly probable that the relation between Abraham and Lot would have been what it was, had not Haran died; but be this as it may, we read this introduction of Lot into the genealogy of Terah as an anticipation of the story to which it furnishes an introduction, and in which Lot is destined to play an important part.The sections of that story in which Lot appears are: in Ge 11, the migration from Ur to Haran; in Ge 12, Abraham&#x27;s wanderings; in Ge 13, the separation of Abraham and Lot; in Ge 14, the campaign of the eastern kings against Sodom and Abraham&#x27;s recovery of the captives; and in Ge 19, the destruction of Sodom.In Ge 14:14,16 Lot is termed the &quot;brother&quot; of Abraham; but that this does not represent a variant tradition is proved by reference to 14:12 of the same chapter (ascribed to &quot;an independent source&quot;) and to 13:8 (ascribed to J; compare 11:28 J).II. Career.1. First Period:Lot&#x27;s life, as the scanty references to him permit us to reconstruct it, falls into four periods. Of the first period--that previous to the migration from Haran--we know nothing save Lot&#x27;s birth in Ur, the death of his father there, the marriage of his sister Milcah to his uncle Nahor (of another sister, Iscah, we learn only the name), and the journey to Haran in company with Terah, Abraham and Sarah. The fact that Sarah&#x27;s childlessness and Haran&#x27;s death are the only two circumstances related of the family history, may serve to explain why Lot went with Abraham instead of staying with Nahor. A childless uncle and a fatherless nephew may well have remained together with the idea that, even if there was no formal adoption, the nephew might become his uncle&#x27;s heir. Certainly, the promise of a numberless seed, so often repeated to the patriarchs, comes first to Abraham immediately after Lot has separated from him (see Ge 13:6-18).2. Second Period:In the second period of Lot&#x27;s life, we find him the companion of Abraham on his journeys from Mesopotamia to Canaan, through Canaan to Egypt, and back again to the neighborhood of Beth-el. His position is subordinate, for his uncle is head of the family, and oriental custom is uniform and rigorous in the matter of family rule. Hence, the use of the singular number throughout the narrative. What Abraham did, his whole &quot;clan&quot; did. Yet Lot&#x27;s position was as nearly independent as these patriarcha...</p>

Paul, in his matchless ode on love (1Co 13), makes it the greatest of the graces of the Christian life--greater than speaking with tongues, or the gift of prophecy, or the possession of a faith of superior excellence; for without love all these gifts and graces, desirable and useful as they are in themselves, are as nothing, certainly of no permanent value in the sight of God. Not that either Jesus or Paul underestimates the faith from which all the graces proceed, for this grace is recognized as fundamental in all God&#x27;s dealings with man and man&#x27;s dealings with God (Joh 6:28 f; Heb 11:6); but both alike count that faith as but idle and worthless belief that does not manifest itself in love to both God and man. As love is the highest expression of God and His relation to mankind, so it must be the highest expression of man&#x27;s relation to his Maker and to his fellow-man.I. Definition.While the Hebrew and Greek words for &quot;love&quot; have various shades and intensities of meaning, they may be summed up in some such definition as this: Love, whether used of God or man, is an earnest and anxious desire for and an active and beneficent interest ins the well-being of the one loved. Different degrees and manifestations of this affection are recognized in the Scriptures according to the circumstances and relations of life, e.g. the expression of love as between husband and wife, parent and child, brethren according to the flesh, and according to grace; between friend and enemy, and, finally, between God and man. It must not be overlooked, however, that the fundamental idea of love as expressed in the definition of it is never absent in any one of these relations of life, even though the manifestation thereof may differ according to the circumstances and relations. Christ&#x27;s interview with the apostle Peter on the shore of the Sea of Tiberias (Joh 21:15-18) sets before us in a most beautiful way the different shades of meaning as found in the New Testament words phileo, and agapao. In the question of Christ, &quot;Lovest thou me more than these?&quot; the Greek verb agapas, denotes the highest, most perfect kind of love (Latin, diligere), implying a clear determination of will and judgment, and belonging particularly to the sphere of Divine revelation. In his answer Peter substitutes the word philo, which means the natural human affection, with its strong feeling, or sentiment, and is never used in Scripture language to designate man&#x27;s love to God. While the answer of Peter, then, claims only an inferior kind of love, as compared to the one contained in Christ&#x27;s question, he nevertheless is confident of possessing at least such love for his Lord.II.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">luv-ing-kind&#x27;-nes (hecedh): &quot;Lovingkindness&quot; in the King James Version always represents this word (30 times), but of hecedh there are many other renderings, e.g. &quot;mercy&quot; (frequently), &quot;kindness&quot; (38), &quot;goodness&quot; (12). The word is derived from chacadh, meaning, perhaps, &quot;to bend or bow oneself,&quot; &quot;to incline oneself&quot;; hence, &quot;to be gracious or merciful.&quot; the English Revised Version has not many changes, but in the American Standard Revised Version &quot;lovingkindness&quot; is invariably employed when checedh is used of God, and, as a rule, &quot;kindness&quot; when it is used of man, as in Ge 21:23; Jud 1:24 (the King James Version &quot;mercy,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;deal kindly&quot;); Ru 3:10; 2Ch 32:32; 35:26 (the King James Version &quot;goodness,&quot;&#x27;); margin &quot;Hebrew: kindness&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;good deeds&quot;); Job 6:14, etc. Of the uses of the word as on man&#x27;s part toward God, the only occurrences are: Jer 2:2, &quot;I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals,&quot; etc.; Ho 6:4,6, &quot;Your goodness (the Revised Version margin &quot;or kindness&quot;) is as a morning cloud,&quot; &quot;I desire goodness (the King James Version &quot;mercy,&quot; the Revised Version margin &quot;Kindness&quot;), and not sacrifice,&quot; which last passage may denote kindness as toward man.When used of God checedh denotes, in general, &quot;the Divine Love condescending to His creatures, more especially to sinners, in unmerited kindness&quot; (Delitzsch). It is frequency associated with forgiveness, and is practically equivalent to &quot;mercy&quot; or &quot;mercifulness&quot; (Ex 20:6), &quot;showing lovingkindness (the English Revised Version &quot;mercy&quot;) unto thousands of them that love me&quot;; Ex 34:6 f, &quot;slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness (the English Revised Version &quot;plenteous in mercy&quot;)&quot;; (34:7) &quot;keeping lovingkindness (the English Revised Version &quot;mercy&quot;) for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin&quot; (compare Nu 14:18); Mic 7:18, &quot;He retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in lovingkindness&quot; (the English Revised Version &quot;mercy&quot;). This quality in Yahweh was one by which He sought to bind His people to Himself. It is greatly magnified in the Old Testament, highly extolled and gloried in, in many of the psalms (Ps 136 has the constant refrain, &quot;For his lovingkindness endureth forever&quot;). In De 7:12 it is associated with the covenant, and in 2Sa 7:15 with the covenant with David (compare Isa 55:3, etc.). It was something that could always be relied on.Being such an essential and distinctive quality of God, the prophets taught that it should also characterize His people. It is part of the Divine requirement in Mic 6:8, &quot;to love kindness&quot; (compare Zec 7:9, &quot;Show kindness and compassion every man to his brother&quot;). The want of it in the nation was a cause of Yahweh&#x27;s controversy with them, e.g. Ho 4:1, &quot;There is no truth, nor goodness (checedh) (the King James Version and the English Revised Version &quot;mercy&quot;), nor knowledge of God in the land&quot;; Ho 12:6, &quot;Therefore turn thou to ...</p>

As the praenomen only of the consul is given, there has been much discussion as to the person intended. The weight of probability has been assigned to Lucius Calpurnius Piso, who was one of the consuls in 139-138 BC, the fact of his praenomen being Cneius and not Lucius being explained by an error in transcription and the fragmentary character of the documents. The authority of the Romans not being as yet thoroughly established in Asia, they were naturally anxious to form alliances with the kings of Egypt and with the Jews to keep Syria in check. The imperfections that are generally admitted in the transcription of the Roman letter are not such as in any serious degree to invalidate the authority of the narrative in 1 Maccabees.J.

He was probably one of those &quot;men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks also&quot; (Ac 11:20). It has been suggested that he is the same as Luke, but this is merely conjecture.(2) &quot;Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen&quot; were among those who joined Paul in saluting the Christians in Rome (Ro 16:21). By &quot;kinsmen&quot; Paul means &quot;Jews&quot; (compare Ro 9:3; 16:11,21).

Two Different Nationalities:In Ge 10:13 Ludim appears as the firstborn of Mizraim (Egypt), and in 10:22 Lud is the fourth son of Shem. #We have therefore to do with two different nationalities bearing the same name, and not always easy to distinguish. 1Ch 1:11,17 simply repeat the statements of Ge 10:13,22. In Isa 66:19 Lud is mentioned with Tarshish and Pul (generally regarded as a mistake for Phut), Tubal, Javan, and the isles. Accepting this emendation, the passage agrees with Jer 46:9, where the Ludim are spoken of with Kush and Phut as the allies of Egypt; and also with Eze 27:10, where Lud is referred to with Persia and Put as soldiers of Tyre. Lud, again, is mentioned with Ethiopia (Gush), Put, all the mingled people, Cab, and the children of the land which is in league (or, margin &quot;the land of the covenant&quot;), which were all to fall by the sword (Eze 30:5).2. The Semitic Lud:Coming to the Semitic Lud, it is to be noted that the Assyrians called Lydia Lu(d)du, and that the mythical ancestor of the Lydians, according to Herodotus (i.7), was Lydos, and their first king, Agros, was descended from Ninos and Belos, i.e. Assyria and Babylonia. The apparently Assyrian colony in Cappadocia about 2000 BC, who used the Babylonian script, may be regarded as supporting this statement, and that there were other colonies of the same nationality in the neighborhood is implied by the fact that Assyro-Babylonian was one of the official languages of the Hittite state whose capital was Hattu or Boghaz-keui. On the other hand when Gyges sent an embassy to Assur-bani-apli of Assyria, Lu(d)du is described as a country whose name had never before been heard, and whose language was unknown. As, however, the earlier kings of Assyria certainly warred in that district, this statement has to be taken with caution. Perhaps the name had changed in the interval, owing to an immigration similar to that which brought the Hittites into Asia Minor, and caused change in the language at the same time.3. Not Recognizable as Semitic Later:Naturally Lydia was not recognizable as Semitic in classical times. The existence of Lud in the neighborhood of Egypt as well as in Asia Minor finds parallels in the Syrian Mucri of the Assyrian inscriptions by the side of the Mucur which stood for Egypt, and still more in the Cappadocian Cush (Kusu) of certain Assyrian letters relating to horses, by the side of the Cush (Kusu likewise) which stands for Ethiopia.4. Egyptian Lud Not Recognizable:Everything points, therefore, to the Semitic Lud and Ludim being Lydia, and the identification may be regarded as satisfactory. It is altogether otherwise with the Egyptian Lud and Ludim, however, about which little can be said at present. The reference to a city which seems to be Putu-yawan in an inscription mentioning the 37th year of Nebuchadrezzar, and apparently referring to an expedition against Amasi...</p>

It is clearly identical with the way, or descent, of Horonaim. Eusebius, Onomasticon places Luhith between Areopolis and Zoar. Some way is intended by which fugitives from the Arabah could reach the uplands of the Moabite plateau. Guthe thinks it may be the road which leads from the district of the ancient Zoar on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea to the uplands through Wady Bene Hammad. Along this track ran also a Roman road. If Horonaim were the higher of the two places, this might account for the way being called the &quot;descent&quot; of Horonaim as going down from that place, and the &quot;ascent&quot; of Luhith as going up thence. Neither place can as yet be identified with certainty.W. Ewing</p>

Old Latin manuscripts frequently have the words CATA LUCANUM as the title of the Third Gospel. (But the form Loukios, is also found in inscriptions synonymous with Loukas; compare Ramsay, The Expositor, December, 1912.)It was a common fashion in the koine to abbreviate proper names, as it is today, for that matter (compare Amphias from Amphiatos, Antipas from Antipatros, Apollos from Apollonias, Demas from Demetrios, Zenas from Zenodoros, etc.; and see Jannaris, Historical Greek Grammar, section 287).2. Mentioned Three Times by Name:Paul alone names Luke (Col 4:14; 2Ti 4:11; Phm 1:24). He does not mention his own name in the Gospel or in the Acts. Compare the silence of the Fourth Gospel concerning the name of the apostle John. There was no particular occasion to mention Luke&#x27;s name in the Gospel, except as the author, if he had so wished. The late legend that Luke was one of the Seventy sent out by Jesus (Epiphanius, Haer., ii.51, 11) is pure conjecture, as is the story that Luke was one of the Greeks who came to Philip for an introduction to Jesus (Joh 12:20 f), or the companion of Cleopas in the walk to Emmaus (Lu 24:13). The clear implication of Lu 1:2 is that Luke himself was not an eyewitness of the ministry of Jesus.3. A Gentile:In Col 4:14 Luke is distinguished by Paul from those &quot;of the circumcision&quot; (Aristarchus, Mark, Jesus Justus). Epaphras, Luke, Demas form the Gentilegroup. He was believed by the early Christian writers to have come directly from heathendom to Christianity. He may or may not have been a Jewish proselyte. His first appearance with Paul at Troas (compare the &quot;we&quot;-sections, Ac 16:10-12) is in harmony with this idea. The classic introduction to the Gospel (Lu 1:1-4) shows that he was a man of culture (compare Apollos and Paul). He was a man of the schools, and his Greek has a literary flavor only approached in the New Testament by Paul&#x27;s writings and by the Epistle to the Hebrews.4. Home:His home is very uncertain. The text of D (Codex Bezae) and several Latin authorities have a &quot;we-&quot;passage in Ac 11:27. If this reading, the so-called B text of Blass, is the original, then Luke was at Antioch and may have been present at the great event recorded in Ac 13:1 f. But it is possible that the Western text is an interpolation. At any rate, it is not likely that Luke is the same person as Lucius of Ac 13:1. Ramsay (St. Paul the Traveler, 389 f) thinks that Eusebius (Historia Ecclesiastica, III, iv, 6) does not mean to say that Luke was a native of Antioch, but only that he had Antiochian family connections. Jerome calls him Lucas medicus Antiochensis. He certainly shows an interest in Antioch (compare Ac 11:19-27; 13:1; 14:26; 15:22,23,30,35; 18:22). Antioch, of course, played a great part in the early work of Paul. Other stories make Luke live in Alexandria and Achaia and narrate that he died in Achaia or Bithynia. But we know that he lived in...</p>

Text:The five primary uncials (Codices Sinaiticus, Alexandrinus, Vaticanus, Ephraemi, Bezae) are the chief witnesses for the text of Luke&#x27;s Gospel. This group is reinforced by L, Codex Delta and the Freer (Detroit) MS; R, T, X and Xi are also valuable in fragments. The other uncials are of secondary value. The Latin, Egyptian and Syriac versions are also of great importance. There are 4 Latin versions (African, European, Italian, Vulgate), 3 Egyptian (Memphitic, Sahidic, Bohairic), 5 Syriac (Curetonian, Sinaitic, Peshitto, Harclean, Palestinian or Jerusalem). Many of the cursive (minuscule) manuscripts are also of considerable worth, as are some of the quotations from the Fathers.Blass, Philology of the Gospels (1898), has advanced theory of two recensions of this Gospel (a longer and a shorter), such as he holds to be true of Acts. In the case of Acts, theory has won some acceptance (see ACTS OF THE APOSTLES), but that is not true of the Gospel to any extent. The Western text of the Gospel is the shorter text, while in Ac it is the longer text. In both instances Blass holds that the shorter text was issued after the longer and original text. His idea is that Luke himself revised and issued the shorter text. In itself this is, of course, possible, since the books are both addressed to an individual, Theophilus. The other edition may have been meant for others. Westcott and Hort, The New Testament in Greek explain the omission in the Western text of the Gospel as &quot;Western non-interpolations,&quot; and often hold them to be the true text. As samples one may note Lu 10:41; 12:19; 24:36,40,42, where the Western text is the shorter text. This is not always true, however, for in 6:2 ff Codex Bezae (D) has the famous passage about the man working on the Sabbath, which the other documents do not give. In Lu 3:22, D has the reading of Ps 2:7 (&quot; Thou art my Son; this day I have begotten thee&quot;) for the usual text. Zahn (Introduction, III, 38) accepts this as the true text. There is no doubt of the interest and value of the Western readings in Luke, but it cannot be said that Blass has carried his point here. The peculiar mutilation of the Gospel by Marcion has an interest of its own.2. Canonicity:Plummer (Commentary on Luke, lxxx) says: &quot;In the second half of the 2nd century this Gospel is recognized as authentic and authoritative; and it is impossible to show that it had not been thus recognized at a very much earlier date.&quot; On the other hand, Schmiedel (Encyclopedia Biblica) says: &quot;This `tradition,&#x27; however, cannot be traced farther back than toward the end of the 2nd century (Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria and the Muratorian Fragment); there is no sound basis for the contention of Zahn (II, 175) that the existence of the tradition can also be found as early as in Marcion, because that writer, from his aversion to the Third Gospel (which ne...</p>

Incorrect Translation:The English word &quot;lunatic,&quot; which in popular speech signifies a sufferer from any mental derangement, whether periodic or chronic, other than congenital idiocy, appears in the King James Version as a translation of the Greek word seleniazomai, in the two passages where it occurs. In the Revised Version (British and American) the word has very properly been displaced by the strictly accurate term &quot;epileptic.&quot; This change is justified not only by the extra-Biblical usage (see Liddell and Scott, under the word), but clearly enough by Mt 17:15 (compare 4:24), where epilepsy is circumstantially described.2. Original Meaning:The original meaning of the term seleniazomai, &quot;moon-struck,&quot; is connected with the popular belief, widespread and of strange persistency, that the moon, in certain of its phases, is injurious to human beings, especially in the case of diseases of a periodic or remittent character. There are no data by which to determine whether, in the New Testament times, this particular word represented a living and active belief or had passed into the state of usage in which the original metaphor disappears, and the word simply indicates the fact signified without reference to the idea embodied in the etymology. We still use the word &quot;lunatic&quot; to signify a person mentally diseased, although we have long since ceased to believe in the moon&#x27;s influence in such cases.II. Madness.The Bible designates &quot;madness,&quot; or alienation of mind, by various terms, all of which seem to be onomatopoetic. These various words seem to be derived from the strange and fierce or mournful cries uttered by the unfortunate victims of this dread malady. In De 28:34 the word &quot;maddened&quot; is meshugga`, participle of shagha` (compare also 1Sa 21:15). With this corresponds the word mainomai, in the New Testament. In 1Sa 21:13 (Hebrew 14) the word is a form of the verb chalal, which is also a derivative from the sound indicated.In certain cases, though by no means uniformly, madness is ascribed to demon-possession (Lu 8:26 f) . One is struck by the fact that mental derangement occupies a very small place in Scripture.Louis Matthews Sweet</p>

It probably meant at first a strong desire, a craving, abnormal appetite, not only for physical but for spiritual satisfaction. It has come, however, to be confined in its use almost entirely to the bad sense. Some old translations are not accepted now, the word being used in connections which at present seem almost irreverent. Shades of meaning are learned from an examination of the Hebrew and Greek originals.1. The Old Testament Use:The substantive and verbs are:(1) Nephesh, in Ex 15:9 and Ps 78:18 translated &quot;desire&quot;; &quot;My desire shall be satisfied&quot;; &quot;by asking food according to their desire.&quot; A strong but not sensual sense.(2) Sheriruth, meaning &quot;obstinacy,&quot; evil imagination. Yahweh said (Ps 81:12), &quot;I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart,&quot; a willful self-satisfaction.(3) Ta&#x27;awah, &quot;a delight&quot; &quot;a longing satisfaction,&quot; and so it came to mean &quot;sinful pleasure.&quot; Translated in Ps 78:30, &quot;that which they desired,&quot; intensely longed for, referring to Yahweh&#x27;s provision of food in the wilderness. Also in Nu 11:4 concerning &quot;flesh to eat&quot; it is said the multitude &quot;lusted exceedingly&quot; i.e. &quot;craved eagerly.(4) Chamadh, the verb meaning &quot;to delight in,&quot; &quot;greatly belove,&quot; &quot;covet,&quot; probably for evil purposes. The young man is warned against the evil woman (Pr 6:25): &quot;Lust not after her beauty.&quot; Here the bad sense is evident, for in the same connection are used such expressions as &quot;harlot,&quot; &quot;adulteress,&quot; &quot;evil woman.&quot;(5) &#x27;Awah, meaning &quot;greatly to desire,&quot; long after, with undue emphasis, with evil spirit though not perhaps with impure thought. In Nu 11:34 reference is made to a place called qibhroth ha-ta&#x27;wah, &quot;the graves of lust, where &quot;they buried the people that lusted.&quot; Ps 106:14 also refers to the Israelites who &quot;lusted exceedingly.&quot; Translated in De 12:15,21 &quot;desire of thy soul&quot;; 12:20; 14:26, &quot;thy soul desireth.&quot; These Deuteronomy passages evidently mean lust only in the good sense.2. The New Testament Use:As in the Old Testament, so in the New Testament we find both meanings of the word.(1) Epithumia is used most frequently, and means a longing for the unlawful, hence, concupiscence, desire, lust. The following references hold the idea, not only of sinful desire known as &quot;fleshly,&quot; &quot;worldly,&quot; as opposed to &quot;spiritual&quot; &quot;heavenly,&quot; &quot;the will of man&quot; as opposed to &quot;the will of God,&quot; but also the sensual desire connected with adultery, fornication; verb in Mt 5:28; Mr 4:19; Joh 8:44; Ro 1:24; 1Co 10:6; Ga 5:16,17,24; Tit 2:12; 1Pe 1:14; 1 Joh 2:16 f; Jude 1:16,18; Re 18:14.(2) Hedone, delight in sensuality, hence, wicked pleasures; translated in Jas 4:1,3 &quot;pleasures&quot;: &quot;Your pleasures that war in your members&quot;; &quot;Ye ask amiss, that ye may spend it in your pleasures&quot; (the King James Version &quot;lust&quot;).(3) ...</p>

It may also mean &quot;bone,&quot; particularly a bone of the spine, and might be applied to a rocky height supposed to resemble a backbone (Lagarde, Uebersicht., 157 f). Winckler explains it by Aramaic laudh, &quot;asylum,&quot; which might be suitably applied to a sanctuary (Geschichte Israels). Cheyne (EB, under the word) would derive it by corruption from chalutsah, &quot;strong (city).&quot;(1) This was the ancient name of Bethel (Ge 28:19; Jud 1:23; compare Ge 35:6; 48:3; Jos 16:2; 18:13). It has been thought that Jos 16:2 contradicts this, and that the two places were distinct. Referring to Ge 28:19, we find that the name Bethel was given to &quot;the place,&quot; ha-maqom, i.e. &quot;the sanctuary,&quot; probably &quot;the place&quot; (28:11, Hebrew) associated with the sacrifice of Abraham (12:8), which lay to the East of Bethel. The name of the city as distinguished from &quot;the place&quot; was Luz. As the fame of the sanctuary grew, we may suppose, its name overshadowed, and finally superseded, that of the neighboring town. The memory of the ancient nomenclature persisting among the people sufficiently explains the allusions in the passages cited.(2) A Bethelite, the man who betrayed the city into the hands of the children of Joseph, went into the land of the Hittites, and there founded a city which he called Luz, after the ancient name of his native place (Jud 1:26). No satisfactory identification has been suggested.W. Ewing</p>

In the time of Paul, it was bounded on the North by Galatia proper (but lay in the Roman province Galatia), on the East by Cappadocia, on the South by Cilicia Tracheia, and on the West by Pisidia and Phrygia. The boundary of Phrygia and Lycaonia passed between Iconium and Lystra (see ICONIUM). Lycaonia consists of a level plain, waterless and treeless, rising at its southern fringe for some distance into the foothills of Taurus, and broken on its eastern side by the volcanic mass of Kara-Dagh and by many smaller hills. Strabo informs us that King Amyntas of Galatia fed many flocks of sheep on the Lycaonian plain. Much of the northern portion of Lycaonia has been proved by recent discovery to have belonged to the Roman emperors, who inherited the crown lands of Amyntas.In Ac 14:6 Lycaonia is summed up as consisting of the cities of Lystra and Derbe and the district (including many villages) lying around them. This description refers to a particular division of Lycaonia, which alone is mentioned in the Bible. In the time of Paul, Lycaonia consisted of two parts, a western and an eastern. The western part was a &quot;region&quot; or subdivision of the Roman province Galatia; the eastern was called Lycaonia Antiochiana, after Antiochus of Commagene under whom it had been placed in 37 AD. This non-Roman portion was traversed by Paul; but nothing is recorded of his journey through it (see DERBE). It included the important city of Laranda; and when Lycaonia is described as consisting of the cities of Lystra and Derbe and the surrounding district, the writer is clearly thinking only of the western portion of Lycaonia, which lay in, and formed a &quot;region&quot; of, the province Galatia. This is the tract of country which is meant in Ac 18:23, where it is called the &quot;region&quot; of Galatia, and placed side by side with Phrygia, another region of Galatia. The province Galatia was divided into districts technically known as &quot;regions,&quot; and Roman Lycaonia is called the &quot;region of Galatia&quot; in implied contrast with Antiochian Lycaonia, which lay outside the Roman province. Of the language of Lycaonia. (see LYSTRA) nothing survives except some personal and place names, which are discussed in Kretschmar&#x27;s Einleitung in die Gesch. der griech.

The surface of Lycia is exceedingly rugged, and its lofty mountains rise almost directly from the sea. Over them several trade routes or passes lead from the coast to the interior. Down the mountain sides rush many small rivers, of which the Xanthus is the chief. The history of Lycia, like that of the neighboring countries, forms a part of the history of Asia Minor. Successively it was in the possession of the Persians, of Alexander the Great, of the Seleucid kings and of the Ptolemies. In 188 BC it fell into the hands of the Romans, who gave it to the island of Rhodes; 20 years later, because of its loyalty to Rome, it became free and independent (1 Macc 15:23). In 53 AD, during the reign of the emperor Claudius, it became a Roman province, and in 74 AD it was united with Pamphylia to form a double province over which a Roman governor presided.At different times during the history of Lycia, there were about 100 places which issued coins of their own. Pliny speaks of 70 cities which had existed there, but in his age there were but 36. Of these, Patara, Myra and Phaselis are of interest to Bible students. From the coast city of Patara, according to Ac 21 f, Paul took ship for Phoenicia. It was a place celebrated not only as a trading-center, and a port of entry to the interior, but as the seat of the oracle of Apollo, and the birthplace of Nicholas. Myra, though over 2 miles from the coast, possessed a harbor, and was also a trading-center. Here, according to Ac 27:5-38, Paul found a grain ship from Alexandria. For some time Myra was the capital of the Roman province; to Christendom it is especially known as the home of Nicholas, who was its bishop and the patron saint of the sailors along the coast. Phaselis, on the border of Pamphylia, was also the home of the bishop.Lycia was a stopping-place, rather than the scene of the active work of Paul, and therefore it figures little in the earliest history of Christianity. For a long time the people strongly opposed the introduction of a strange religion, and in 312 AD they even petitioned the Roman emperor Maximin against it. A portion of the petition has been discovered at Arykander.E. J. Banks</p>

Its surface is rugged, but along the valleys between its mountain ranges ran some of the most important highways from the coast cities to the distant interior. Of its many rivers the chief are the Cayster, the Lower Hermus, the Cogamos, the Caicus and, during a part of its course, the Meander.Lydia was an exceedingly ancient and powerful kingdom whose history is composed chiefly of that of its individual cities. In 546 BC it fell into the hands of the Persians, and in 334 BC it became a part of Alexander&#x27;s empire. After the death of Alexander its possession was claimed by the kings both of Pergamos and of Seleucia, but in 190 BC it became the undisputed possession of the former (1 Macc 8:8). With the death of Attalus III, 133 BC, it was transferred by the will of that king to Rome, and Lydia, which then became but a name, formed, along with Caria, Mysia and Phrygia, a part of the Roman province of Asia (see ASIA). Chief among its cities were Smyrna and Ephesus, two of the most important in Asia Minor, and Smyrna is still the largest and wealthiest city of that part of Turkey. At Ephesus, the seat of the goddess Diana, Paul remained longer than elsewhere in Asia, and there his most important missionary work was done (Ac 19). Hence, Lydia figures prominently in the early history of the church; it became Christianized during the residence of the apostle at Ephesus, or soon afterward (see also LUD).E. J. Banks</p>

It has always been and is still a common custom in the Orient to refer to one living in a foreign land by employing the adjective which designates the nationality. Renan thinks it means &quot;the Lydian&quot;; Thyatira is a city of Lydia. Lydia was (1) living in Philippi, (2) of the city of Thyatira, (3) a seller of the purple-dyed garments from her native town, (4) and &quot;one that worshipped God.&quot; Her occupation shows her to have been a woman of some capital. The phrase which describes her religion (sebomene ton Theon) is the usual designation for a proselyte. She was in the habit of frequenting a place of prayer by a riverside, a situation convenient for the necessary ablutions required by the Jewish worship, and there Paul and his companions met her. After she had been listening to Paul (Greek imperfect), the Lord opened her heart to give heed to his teaching (&quot;To open is the part of God, to pay attention that of the woman,&quot; Chrysostom). Her baptism and that of her household followed. To prove her sincerity she besought the missionaries to accept the hospitality of her home. Her house probably became the center for the church in Philippi (Ac 16:14,15,40). Lydia is not mentioned in Paul&#x27;s letter to the Philippians, but, if Ramsay be correct, she may have been Euodias or Syntyche (Php 4:2).S. F. Hunter</p>

A Lysanias is mentioned by Josephus as having ruled over Chalcis and Abilene, and as having been slain by Mark Antony at the instigation of Cleopatra. As this happened about 36 BC, Luke has been charged with inaccuracy. Inscriptions, however, corroborate the view that the Lysanias of Luke was probably a descendant of the Lysanias mentioned by Josephus (compare Schurer, H J the Priestly Code (P), div I, volume II, App. 1, p. 338).C.

According to Josephus (Ant., XII, vii, 2), the instructions of Lysias were&#x27; &quot;to conquer Judea, enslave its inhabitants, utterly destroy Jerusalem and abolish the whole nation.&quot; Lysias, accordingly, armed against Judas Maccabeus a large force under Ptolemy, son of Dorymenes, Nicanor and Gorgias. Of this force Judas defeated the two divisions under Nicanor and Gorgias near Emmaus (166 BC), and in the following year Lysias himself at Bethsura (1 Macc 4), after which he proceeded to the purification of the temple. In the narration of these campaigns there are considerable differences between the writers of 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees which scholars have not found easy to explain. Antiochus died at Babylon on his Persian expedition (164 BC), and Lysias assumed the office of regent during the minority of his son, who was yet a child (1 Macc 6:17). He collected another army at Antioch, and after the recapture of Bethsura was besieging Jerusalem when he learned of the approach of Philip to whom Antiochus, on his deathbed, had entrusted the guardianship of the prince (1 Macc 6:15; 2 Macc 13). He defeated Philip in 163 BC and was supported at Rome, but in the following year he fell with his ward Antiochus into the hands of Demetrius I (Soter), who put both of them to death (1 Macc 7:1-23).(2) See CLAUDIUS LYSIAS (Ac 23:26).J.

When Menelaus was summoned to Antioch (2 Macc 4:29) on a charge of malversation, he left Lysimachus as his deputy in the priesthood at Jerusalem. Lysimachus robbed the temple and caused an insurrection in which he met his death beside the treasury (2 Macc 4:42).

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">lis&#x27;-tra: The forms Lustran, and Lustrois, occur. Such variation in the gender of Anatolian city-names is common (see Harnack, Apostelgeschichte, 86; Ramsay, Paul the Traveler, 128). Lystra was visited by Paul 4 times (Ac 14:6,21; 16:1; 18:23 --the last according to the &quot;South Galatian&quot; theory), and is mentioned in 2Ti 3:10 f as one of the places where Paul suffered persecution. Timothy resided in Lystra (Ac 16:1).1. Character and Site:Lystra owed its importance, and the attention which Paul paid to it, to the fact that it had been made a Roman colonia by Augustus (see ANTIOCH), and was therefore, in the time of Paul, a center of education and enlightenment. Nothing is known of its earlier, and little of its later, history. The site of Lystra was placed by Leake (1820) at a hill near Khatyn Serai, 18 miles South-Southwest from Iconium; this identification was proved correct by an inscription found by Sterrett in 1885. The boundary between Phrygia and Lycaonia passed between Iconium and Lystra. (Ac 14:6) (see ICONIUM).The population of Lystra consisted of the local aristocracy of Roman soldiers who formed the garrison of the colonia, of Greeks and Jews (Ac 16:1,3), and of native Lycaonians (Ac 14:11).2. Worship of Paul and Barnabas:After Paul had healed a life-long cripple at Lystra, the native population (the &quot;multitude&quot; of Ac 14:11) regarded him and Barnabas as pagan gods come down to them in likeness of men, and called Barnabas &quot;Zeus&quot; and Paul &quot;Hermes.&quot; Commentators on this incident usually point out that the same pair of divinities appeared to Baucis and Philemon in Ovid&#x27;s well-known story, which he locates in the neighboring Phrygia. The accuracy in detail of this part of the narrative in Ac has been strikingly confirmed by recent epigraphic discovery. Two inscriptions found in the neighborhood of Lystra in 1909 run as follows:(1) &quot;Kakkan and Maramoas and Iman Licinius priests of Zeus&quot;;(2) &quot;Toues Macrinus also called Abascantus and Batasis son of Bretasis having made in accordance with a vow at their own expense (a statue of) Hermes Most Great along with a sun-dial dedicated it to Zeus the sun-god.&quot;Now it is evident from the narrative in Ac that the people who were prepared to worship Paul and Barnabas as gods were not Greeks or Romans, but native Lycaonians. This is conclusively brought out by the use of the phrase &quot;in the speech of Lycaonia&quot; (Ac 14:11). The language in ordinary use among the educated classes in Central Anatolian cities under the Roman Empire was Greek; in some of those cities, and especially of course, in Roman colonies, Latin also was understood, and it was used at this period in official documents. But the Anatolian element in the population of those cities continued for a long time to use the native language (e.g. Phrygian was in use at Iconium till the 3rd century of our era; see ICONIUM). In the story in Ac a fast distinction is implied, and in fact existed, between the ideas and practices of the Greeks and the Roman c...</p>
