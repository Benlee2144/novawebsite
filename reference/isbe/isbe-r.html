The Meaning of &quot;Store-Cities&quot;:One of the two &quot;settlements&quot; (mickenoth) built, or &quot;built up,&quot; by the Hebrews for the Pharaoh, the other being Pithom, to which the Septuagint adds a third, namely, &quot;On which is Heliopolis,&quot; a town near Cairo (Ex 1:11). The Hebrew term mickenoth comes from a root meaning &quot;to settle down&quot; (Arabic sakan, &quot;settlement,&quot; Assyrian sakanu or shakanu, &quot;to set&quot;), but it is rendered &quot;strong cities&quot; in Septuagint, &quot;treasure cities&quot; in the King James Version, and (incorrectly) &quot;store-cities&quot; in the Revised Version: The &quot;land of Rameses,&quot; where Jacob and his sons settled, was apparently the &quot;field of Zoan&quot; (see ZOAN), thus lying in the Delta East of the Bubastic branch of the Nile.2. The Meaning of the Name:It is often assumed that no city called Rameses would have existed before the time of Rameses II, or the 14th century BC, though even before Rameses I the name occurs as that of a brother of Horemhib under the XVIIIth Dynasty. The usual translation &quot;Child of Ra&quot; is grammatically incorrect in Egyptian and as Ra was an ancient name for the &quot;sun&quot; it seems possible that a town may have borne the title &quot;Ra created it&quot; very early. The mention of Rameses in Ge (47:11) is often regarded as an anachronism, since no scholar has supposed that Jacob lived as late as the time of Rameses II. This would equally apply to the other notices, and at most would serve to mark the age of the passages in the Pentateuch where Rameses is mentioned, but even this cannot be thought to be proved (see EXODUS). According to De Rouge (see Pierret, Vocab. Hieroglyph., 1875, 143) there were at least three towns in Lower Egypt that bore the name Pa Rames-ses (&quot;city of Rameses&quot;); but Brugsch supposes that the place mentioned in the Old Testament was Zoan, to which Rameses II gave this name when making it his capital in the Delta. Dr. Budge takes the same view, while Dr. Naville and others suppose that the site of Raamses has still to be found.3. Situation:There appears to have been no certain tradition preserving the site, for though Silvia (about 385 AD) was told that it lay 4 miles from the town of Arabia (see GOSHEN), she found no traces of such a place. Brugsch (&quot;A New City of Rameses, 1876,&quot; Aegyptische Zeitschrift, 69) places one such city in the southern part of Memphis itself. Goodwin (Rec. of Past, Old Series, VI, 11) gives an Egyptian letter describing the &quot;city of Rameses-Miamun,&quot; which appears to be Zoan, since it was on the seacoast. It was a very prosperous city when this letter was written, and a pa-khennu or &quot;palace city.&quot; It had canals full of fish, lakes swarming with birds, fields of lentils, melons, wheat, onions and sesame, gardens of vines, almonds and figs. Ships entered its harbor; the lotus and papyrus grew in its waters. The inhabitants greeted Rameses II with garlands of flowers. Besides wi...</p>

          <h3 style="font-family:var(--font-heading);color:var(--leather-dark);margin:0 0 0.5rem;">RAB-MAG</h3>
          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">rab&#x27;-mag (rabh-magh;. Septuagint has it as a proper noun, Rhabamath): The name of one of the Babylonian princes who were present at the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, during the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah (Jer 39:3,13). The word is a compound, the two parts seemingly being in apposition and signifying tautologically the same thing. The last syllable or section of the word, magh, was the designation among the Medes, Persians and Babylonians for priests and wise men. Its original significance was &quot;great&quot; or &quot;powerful&quot;; Greek megas, Latin magis, magnus. The first syllable, rabh, expresses practically the same idea, that of greatness, or abundance in size, quantity, or power. Thus it might be interpreted the &quot;allwise&quot; or &quot;all-powerful&quot; prince, the chief magician or physician. It is, therefore, a title and not a name, and is accordingly put in appositive relations to the proper name just preceding, as &quot;Nergal-sharezer, the Rab-mag,&quot; translated fully, &quot;Nergal-sharezer the chief prince or magician.&quot;See NERGAL-SHAREZER.In harmony with the commonly accepted view, the proper rendering of the text should be, &quot;All the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, to wit, Nergal-sharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, (the) Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, (the) Rab-mag&quot; (Jer 39:3); and &quot;so Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban, (the) Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, (the) Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon&quot; (Jer 39:13).Walter G.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">rab&#x27;-sa-ris (rabh-caric): As with Rab-mag, which is not regarded as a name, but a title, so this is to be regarded as a descriptive title for the person whose name precedes it (see RAB-MAG). The first part, rabh, signifies &quot;great&quot; or &quot;chief,&quot; the second, caric, is the title for eunuch or chamberlain. The translation then would be chief eunuch or the chief of the eunuchs (or chamberlains).The oriental custom was for the king to surround himself with a number of eunuchs, who performed varied kinds of services, both menial and dignified. They usually had charge of his harem; sometimes they occupied court positions. Frequently they superintended the education of the youth. The term itself was sometimes used to designate persons in places of trust who were not emasculated. The above title describes the highest or chief in rank of these eunuchs.See EUNUCH.The full title is used 3 times, once in connection with the titles of other important officers who were sent by the king of Assyria with a large army to demand the surrender of Jerusalem. The passage would be translated properly, `And the king of Assyria sent the Tartan and the Rab-saris (the chief eunuch) and the Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah&#x27; (2Ki 18:17). Again, it refers to a Babylonian whose real name was Sarsechim, who with the other Babylonian princes sat in the middle gate during the capture of Jerusalem. This event is described as having occurred in the 11th year of Zedekiah, king of Judah (Jer 39:3). The third use is in connection with the name Nebushazban, who, with the other chief officers of the king of Babylon, sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard and committed him to Gedaliah, who was to take him home to dwell with his own people (Jer 39:13).Thus, it is seen that based upon this accepted theory the three titles would be in their connections as follows:(1) simply &quot;the chief eunuch,&quot;(2) Sarsechim, the Rab-saris (or chief eunuch), and(3) Nebushazban, the Rab-saris (or chief eunuch).See also ASSYRIA, sec.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">rab&#x27;-a:(1) (rabbah; Rhabba, Rhabbath, Rhabban. The full name is rabbath bene `ammon; he akra ton huion Ammon, Rhabbath huion Ammon, &quot;Rabbah of the children of Ammon&quot;): This alone of the cities of the Ammonites is mentioned in Scripture, so we may take it as the most important. It is first named in connection with the &quot;bed&quot; or sarcophagus of Og, king of Bashan, which was said to be found here (De 3:11). It lay East of the territory assigned to Gad (Jos 13:25). Whatever may have been its history in the interval, it does not appear again in Scripture till the time of David. This monarch sent an embassy of sympathy to King Hanun when his father Nahash died. The kindness was met by wanton insult, which led to the outbreak of war. The Ammonites, strengthened by Aramean allies, were defeated by the Israelites under Joab, and took refuge in Rabbah. After David&#x27;s defeat of the Arameans at Helam a year later, the Ammonites were exposed alone to the full-force of Israel, the ark of the covenant being carried with the troops. The country was ravaged and siege was laid to Rabbah. It was during this siege that Uriah the Hittite by David&#x27;s orders was exposed &quot;in the forefront of the hottest battle&quot; (2Sa 11:15), where, treacherously deserted by his comrades, he was slain. How long the siege lasted we do not know; probably some years; but the end was in sight when Joab captured &quot;the city of waters&quot; (2Sa 12:27). This may mean that he had secured control of the water supply. In the preceding verse he calls it the &quot;royal city.&quot; By the chivalry of his general, David was enabled in person to enjoy the honor of taking the city. Among the booty secured was the crown of Melcom, the god of the Ammonites. Such of the inhabitants as survived he treated with great severity (2Sa 12:26-31; 1Ch 20:1).In the utterances of the prophets against Ammon, Rabbah stands for the people, as their most important, or perhaps their only important, city (Jer 49:2,3; Eze 21:20; 25:5; Am 1:14). Jer 49:4 speaks of the &quot;flowing valley&quot;--a reference perhaps to the abundance of water and fruitfulness--and the treasures in which she gloried. Eze 21:21 represents the king of Babylon at &quot;the head of the two ways&quot; deciding by means of the divining arrows whether he should march against Jerusalem or against Rabbah. Amos seems to have been impressed with the palaces of Rabbah.The city retained its importance in later times. It was captured by Ptolemy Philadelphus (285-247 BC), who called it Philadelphia. It was a member of the league of ten cities. Antiochus the Great captured it by means of treachery (Polyb. v.71). Josephus (BJ, III, iii, 3) names it as lying East of Peraea. In the 4th century AD, it ranked with Bostra and Gerasa as one of the great fortified cities of Coele-Syria (Ritter, Erdkunde, XV, ii, 1154 f). It became the seat of a bishop. Abulfeda (1321 AD) says that Rabbah was in ruins at the time of the Moslem conquest.Rabbah is represented by the modern `Amman, a ruined site with extensive ...</p>

The second part, which in the Aramaic, probably meant &quot;cupbearer,&quot; had in this connection and elsewhere, according to later discoveries, an extended significance, and meant chief officer, i.e. chief of the heads or captains.Rabshakeh was one of the officers sent by Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, with the Tartan and the Rabsaris to demand the surrender of Jerusalem, which was under siege by the Assyrian army (2Ki 18:17,19,26,27,28,37; 19:4,8; Isa 36:2,4,11,12,13,22; 37:4,8). The three officers named went from Lachish to Jerusalem and appeared by the conduit of the upper pool. Having called upon King Hezekiah, his representatives Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, Shebnah, the scribe, and Joah, the recorder, appeared. Rabshakeh sent through them a message to the king in which he represented himself as the spokesman for the king of Assyria. He derided King Hezekiah in an insolent fashion in representing his trust in Egypt as a bruised reed which would pierce the hand. Likewise his confidence in Yahweh was vain, for He also would be unable to deliver them. Then the officers of the king replied, requesting him to speak in the Syrian language-which they understood, and not in the Jews&#x27; language which the people on the wall understood. This he refused to do, speaking still more loudly in order that they might hear and be persuaded. By bribery and appeal, by promise and by deception he exhorted them to turn traitor to Hezekiah and surrender to him. The people, however, true to the command of Hezekiah (2Ki 18:36), &quot;held their peace, and answered him not a word.&quot; Afterward Rabshakeh returned and &quot;found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah&quot;. (2Ki 19:8). From this description it is inferred that Rabshakeh was a man of considerable literary attainment, being able, in all probability, to speak in three languages. He had, in addition to his official power, dauntless courage, an insolent spirit and a characteristic oriental disregard for veracity.Walter G. Clippinger</p>

In the Bible, it occurs in Mt 5:22 only, but John Lightfoot gives a number of instances of the use of the word by Jewish writers (Hot. Hebrew., edition by Gandell, Oxford, 1859, II, 108). Chrysostom (who was acquainted with Syriac as spoken in the neighborhood of Antioch) says it was equivalent to the Greek su, &quot;thou,&quot; used contemptuously instead of a man&#x27;s name. Jerome rendered it inanis aut vacuus absque cerebro. It is generally explained as expressing contempt for a man&#x27;s intellectual capacity (= &quot;you simpleton!&quot;), while more (translated &quot;thou fool&quot;), in the same verse is taken to refer to a man&#x27;s moral and religious character (= &quot;you rascal!&quot; &quot;you impious fellow!&quot;). Thus we have three stages of anger, with three corresponding grades of punishment:(1) the inner feeling of anger (orgizomenos), to be punished by the local or provincial court (te krisei, &quot;the judgment&quot;);(2) anger breaking forth into an expression of scorn (Raca), to be punished by the Sanhedrin (to sunedrio, &quot;the council&quot;);(3) anger culminating in abusive and defamatory language (More), to be punished by the fire of Gehenna.This view, of a double climax, which has been held by foremost English and Gor. commentators, seems to give the passage symmetry and gradation. But it is rejected among others by T. K. Cheyne, who, following J. P. Peters, rearranges the text by transferring the clause &quot;and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council&quot; to the end of the preceding verse (Encyclopaedia Biblica, IV, cols. 4001 f). There certainly does not seem to be trustworthy external evidence to prove that the terms &quot;the judgment,&quot; &quot;the council,&quot; &quot;the Gehenna of fire&quot; stand to each other in a relation of gradation, as lower and higher legal courts, or would be so understood by Christ&#x27;s hearers. What is beyond dispute is that Christ condemns the use of disparaging and insulting epithets as a supreme offense against the law of humanity, which belongs to the same category as murder itself. It should be added, however, that it is the underlying feeling and not the verbal expression as such that constitutes the sin. Hence, our Lord can, without any real inconsistency, address two of His followers as &quot;foolish men&quot; (Lu 24:25, anoetoi, practically equivalent to Raca, as is also James&#x27;s expression, &quot;O vain man,&quot; Jas 2:20).D.

Biography:An ancestress of Israel, wife of Jacob, mother of Joseph and Benjamin. Rachel was the younger daughter of Laban, the Aramean, the brother of Jacob&#x27;s mother; so Rachel and Jacob were cousins. They met for the first time upon the arrival of Jacob at Haran, when attracted by her beauty he immediately fell in love with her, winning her love by his chivalrous act related in Ge 29:10 ff. According to the custom of the times Jacob contracted with Laban for her possession, agreeing to serve him 7 years as the stipulated price (29:17-20). But when the time had passed, Laban deceived Jacob by giving him Leah instead of Rachel. When Jacob protested, Laban gave him Rachel also, on condition that Jacob serve 7 years more (29:21-29). To her great dismay &quot;Rachel was barren&quot; (Ge 29:30,31), while Leah had children. Rachel, envious of her sister, complained to Jacob, who reminded her that children are the gift of God. Then Rachel resorted to the expedient once employed by Sarah under similar circumstances (16:2 ff); she bade Jacob take her handmaid Bilhah, as a concubine, to &quot;obtain children by her&quot; (30:3). Da and Naphtali were the offspring of this union. The evil of polygamy is apparent from the dismal rivalry arising between the two sisters, each seeking by means of children to win the heart of Jacob. In her eagerness to become a mother of children, Rachel bargained with Leah for the mandrakes, or love-apples of her son Reuben, but all to no avail (Ge 30:14). Finally God heard her prayer and granted her her heart&#x27;s desire, and she gave birth to her firstborn whom she named Joseph (Ge 30:22-24).Some years after this, when Jacob fled from Laban with his wives, the episode of theft of the teraphim of Laban by Rachel, related in Ge 31:19,34,35, occurred. She hoped by securing the household gods of her father to bring prosperity to her own new household. Though she succeeded by her cunning in concealing them from Laban, Jacob later, upon discovering them, had them put away (35:2-4). In spite of all, she continued to be the favorite of Jacob, as is clearly evidenced by 33:2, where we are told that he assigned to her the place of greatest safety, and by his preference for Joseph, her son. After the arrival in Canaan, while they were on the way from Beth-el to Ephrath, i.e. Bethlehem, Rachel gave birth to her second son, Benjamin, and died (35:16 ff).2. Character:In a marked manner Rachel&#x27;s character shows the traits of her family, cunning and covetousness, so evident in Laban, Rebekah and Jacob. Though a believer in the true God (Ge 30:6,8,22), she was yet given to the superstitions of her country, the worshipping of the teraphim, etc. (Ge 31:19). The futility of her efforts in resorting to self-help and superstitious expedients, the love and stronger faith of her husband (Ge 35:2-4), were the providential means of purifying her character. Her memory lived on in Israel ...</p>

Though the pillar, i.e sepulchral monument, has long disappeared, the spot is marked until this day, and Christians, Jews and Mohammedans unite in honoring it. The present tomb, which, apparently, is not older than the 15th century, is built in the style of the small-domed buildings raised by Moslems in honor of their saints. It is a rough structure of four square walls, each about 23 ft. long and 20 ft. high; the dome rising 10 ft. higher is used by Mohammedans for prayer, while on Fridays the Jews make supplication before the empty tomb within. It is doubtful, but probable, that it marks the exact spot where Rachel was buried. There are, apparently, two traditions as to the location of the place. The oldest tradition, based upon Ge 35:16-20; 48:7, points to a place one mile North of Bethlehem and 4 miles from Jerusalem. Mt 2:18 speaks for this place, since the evangelist, reporting the slaughter of the innocents of Bethlehem, represents Rachel as weeping for her children from her neighboring grave. But according to 1Sa 10:2 ff, which apparently represents another tradition, the place of Rachel&#x27;s grave was on the &quot;border of Benjamin,&quot; near Beth-el, about 10 miles North of Jerusalem, at another unknown Ephrath. This location, some believe, is corroborated by Jer 31:15, where the prophet, in relating the leading away of the people of Ramah, which was in Benjamin, into captivity, introduces Rachel the mother of that tribe as bewailing the fate of her descendants. Those that believe this northern location to be the place of Rachel&#x27;s grave take the words, &quot;the same is Beth-lehem,&quot; in Ge 35:19; 48:7, to be an incorrect gloss; but that is a mere assumption lacking sufficient proof.o, following J.

So with the believers, &quot;They looked unto him (Yahweh), and were radiant.&quot; Thus nahar combines the two ideas of being lightened and flowing together. This appears, also, in a different connection, in Isa 60:5, &quot;Then thou shalt see and be radiant.&quot; &quot;It is liquid light--light that ripples and sparkles and runs across the face; .... the light which a face catches from sparkling water&quot; (G.A.

History:(1) Ancient.A very ancient city, the traditional birthplace of Zoroaster (Zarathustra; Pahlavi Vendidad, Zad sparad XVI, 12, and Dabistan i Mazahib). In Yasna XIX, 18, of the Avesta, it is thus mentioned: &quot;The Zoroastrian, four-chief-possessing Ragha, hers are the royal chiefs, both the house-chief, the village-chief, and the town-chief: Zoroaster is the fourth.&quot; In Vend. I, 15: &quot;As the tenth, the best of both districts and cities, I, who am Ahura Mazda, did create Ragha, which possesses the three classes,&quot; i.e. fire-priests, charioteers, husbandmen. Later it was the religious center of magism. A large colony of captive Israelites settled there. Destroyed in Alexander&#x27;s time, it was rebuilt by Seleucus Nicator (circa 300 BC), who named it Europos. Later, Arsaces restored it and named it Arsacia.(2) Medieval.In the early Middle Ages Ragha, then called Rai, was a great literary and often political center with a large population. It was the birthplace of Harun&#x27;al Rashid (763 AD). It was seized and plundered (1029 AD) by Sultan Machmud, but became Tughril&#x27;s capital. In the Vis o Roman (circa 1048 AD) it is an important place, 10 days journey across the Kavir desert from Merv. It was a small provincial town in about 1220 AD. It was sacked by Mongols in 1220 AD and entirely destroyed under Ghazan Khan circa 1295. A Zoroastrian community lived there in 1278 AD, one of whom composed the Zardtusht-Namah.  (3) Present Condition.Near the ruins there now stands the village of Shah Abdu&#x27;l &#x27;Acim, connected with Tehran by the only railway in Persia (opened in 1888).LITERATUREPtolemy, Diodorus Siculus, Pliny, Strabo; Ibnu&#x27;l Athir, Jami&#x27;u t Tawarikh, Tarikh i Jahan-gusha Yaqut; Justi, Iranisches Namenbuch; E.G.

In other passages the chothen of Moses is called &quot;Jether&quot; or &quot;Jethro.&quot; Among the harmonizations suggested the following are worthy of consideration:(a) that all are names or perhaps titles of one man (Rashi);(b) that Reuel was the father of Hobab and Jethro, that Jethro was the father-in-law of Moses, and that the word &quot;father&quot; is used for grandfather in Ex 2:18;(c) that Reuel was the father-in-law and Jethro and Hobab brothers-in-law;(d) that either Reuel or Hobab is to be identified with Jethro.None of these views is free from difficulty, nor is the view of those who would give Jethro as the name in the Elohist (E) and Reuel as that in the Jahwist (Jahwist) and (J-E).See also REUEL.Nathan Isaacs</p>

The two spies sent by Joshua from Shittim came into her house and lodged there (Jos 2:1). She refused to betray them to the king of Jericho, and when he demanded them, she hid them on the roof of her house with stalks of flax that she had laid in order to dry. She pretended that they had escaped before the shutting of the gate, and threw their pursuers off their track. She then told the spies of the fear that the coming of the Israelites had caused in the minds of the Canaanites--&quot;Our hearts did melt .... for Yahweh your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath&quot;--and asked that the men promise to spare her father, mother, brothers and sisters, and all that they had. They promised her to spare them provided they would remain in her house and provided she would keep their business secret. Thereupon she let them down by a cord through the window, her house being built upon the town wall, and gave them directions to make good their escape (Jos 2:1-24). True to their promise, the Israelites under Joshua spared Rahab and her family (Jos 6:16  the King James Version); &quot;And,&quot; says the author of Josh, &quot;she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day.&quot; Her story appealed strongly to the imagination of the people of later times. Heb 11:31 speaks of her as having been saved by faith; James, on the other hand, in demonstrating that a man is justified by works and not by faith only, curiously chooses the same example (Jas 2:25). Jewish tradition has been kindly disposed toward Rahab; one hypothesis goes so far as to make her the wife of Joshua himself (Jew Encyclopedia, under the word). Naturally then the other translation of zonah, deriving it from zun, &quot;to feed,&quot; instead of zanah, &quot;to be a harlot,&quot; has been preferred by some of the commentators.(2) (@Rhachab): Josephus, Ant, V, 1, 2, 7, so spells the name of (1) Septuagint and New Testament contra). The wife of Salmon and mother of Booz (Boaz) according to the genealogy in Mt 1:5. Query, whether there was a tradition identifying (1) and (2); see Lightfoot, Horae Hob on Mt 1:5.(3) (rahabh, literally, &quot;storm,&quot; &quot;arrogance&quot;): A mythical sea-monster, probably referred to in several passages where the word is translated as a common noun &quot;pride&quot; (Job 9:13), &quot;the proud&quot; (Job 26:12; compare Ps 89:10). It is used in parallelism with tannin, &quot;the dragon&quot; (Isa 51:9). It is most familiar as an emblem of Egypt, `the boaster that sitteth still&#x27; (Isa 30:7; Ps 87:4; compare Ps 89:10). The Talmud in Babha&#x27; Bathra&#x27; speaks of rahabh as sar ha-yam, &quot;master of the sea.&quot;See also ASTRONOMY.Nathan Isaacs</p>

It is equivalent to &quot;elegant clothing,&quot; such as courtiers wore, as shown by the words following, &quot;Behold, they that wear soft raiment are in kings&#x27; houses.&quot; John had bravely refused to play courtier and had gone to prison for it.

Water-Supply in Egypt and Palestine:In Egypt there is little or no rainfall, the water for vegetation being supplied in great abundance by the river Nile; but in Syria and Palestine there are no large rivers, and the people have to depend entirely on the fall of rain for water for themselves, their animals and their fields. The children of Israel when in Egypt were promised by Yahweh a land which &quot;drinketh water of the rain of heaven&quot; (De 11:11). Springs and fountains are found in most of the valleys, but the flow of the springs depends directly on the fall of rain or snow in the mountains.2. Importance of Rain in Season:The cultivation of the land in Palestine is practically dry farming in most of the districts, but even then some water is necessary, so that there may be moisture in the soil. In the summer months there is no rain, so that the rains of the spring and fall seasons are absolutely essential for starting and maturing the crops. The lack of this rain in the proper time has often been the cause of complete failure of the harvest. A small difference in the amount of these seasonal rains makes a large difference in the possibility of growing various crops without irrigation. Ellsworth Huntington has insisted on this point with great care in his very important work, Palestine and Its Transformation. The promise of prosperity is given in the assurance of &quot;rain in due season&quot; (Le 26:4 the King James Version). The withholding of rain according to the prophecy of Elijah (1Ki 17:1) caused the mountain streams to dry up (1Ki 17:7), and certain famine ensued. A glimpse of the terrible suffering for lack of water at that time is given us. The people were uncertain of another meal (1Ki 17:12), and the animals were perishing (1Ki 18:5).3. Amount of Rainfall:Palestine and Syria are on the borderland between the sea and the desert, and besides are so mountainous, that they not only have a great range of rainfall in different years, but a great variation in different parts of the country.The amount of rain on the western slopes is comparable with that in England and America, varying from 25 to 40 inches per annum, but it falls mostly in the four winter months, when the downpour is often very heavy, giving oftentimes from 12 to 16 inches in a month. On the eastern slopes it is much less, varying from 8 to 20 inches per annum. The highest amount falls in the mountains of Lebanon where it averages about 50 inches. In Beirut the yearly average is 35,87 inches. As we go South from Syria, the amount decreases (Haifa 27,75, Jaffa 22,39, Gaze 17,61), while in the Sinaitic Peninsula there is little or none. Going from West to East the change is much more sudden, owing to the mountains which stop the clouds. In Damascus the average is less than 10 inches. In Jerusalem the average for 50 years is 26,16 in., and the rang...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ran&#x27;-bo (qesheth, translated &quot;a bow&quot;; iris, &quot;rainbow&quot;): As most of the rainfall in Palestine is in the form of short heavy showers it is often accompanied by the rainbow. Most beautiful double bows are often seen, and occasionally the moon is bright enough to produce the bow. It is rather remarkable that there are so few references to the rainbow in the Bible. The Hebrew qesheth is the ordinary word for a bow, there being no special word for rainbow.The interpretation of the significance of the bow in the sky is given at the close of the story of the flood, where it is called &quot;the token of the covenant&quot; of Yahweh with Noah that there should be no more flood: &quot;I do set my bow in the cloud, .... and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh&quot; (Ge 9:13,15). This addition to the story of the flood is not found in other mythical accounts. The foundation for the interpretation of the bow in this way seems to be that while His bow is hung in the sky God must be at peace with His people. The glory of God is likened to &quot;the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain&quot; (Eze 1:28). The rainbow forms a striking part of the vision in Re 4:3: &quot;And there was a rainbow round about the throne.&quot;Alfred H. Joy</p>

Conder maintains that the present amount would have been sufficient to support the ancient cities (Tent-Work in Palestine). Trees are without doubt fewer now, but meteorologists agree that trees do not produce rain.4. Dry and Rainy Seasons;The rainfall is largely on the western slopes of the mountains facing the sea, while on the eastern slopes there is very little. The moisture-laden air comes up from the sea with the west and southwest wind. When these currents strike the hills they are thrown higher up into the cooler strata, and the moisture condenses to form clouds and rain which increases on the higher levels. Having passed the ridge of the hills, the currents descend on the other side to warmer levels, where the moisture is easily held in the form of vapor so that no rain falls and few clouds are seen, except in the cold mid-winter months.The summer months are practically rainless, with very few clouds appearing in the sky. From May 1 to the middle of October one can be sure of no rain; &quot;The winter is past; the rain is over&quot; (So 2:11), so many sleep on the roofs of the houses or in tents of leaves and branches in the fields and vineyards throughout the summer. The continuous hot droughts make the people appreciate the springs and fountains of fresh running water and the cool shade of rock and tree.The rainy season from October to May may be divided into three parts, the former, the winter, and the latter rains, and they are often referred to under these names in the Old Testament.The &quot;former rains&quot; are the showers of October and the first part of November. They soften the parched ground so that the winter grain may be sown before the heavy continuous rains set in. The main bulk of the rain falls in the months of December, January and February. Although in these months the rains are frequent and heavy, a dark, foggy day is seldom seen. The &quot;latter rains&quot; of April are the most highly appreciated, because they ripen the fruit and stay the drought of summer. They were considered a special blessing: Yahweh &quot;will come .... as the latter rain that watereth the earth&quot; (Ho 6:3); &quot;They opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain&quot; (Job 29:23); and as a reason for worshipping Yahweh who sent them, &quot;Let us no...</p>

For the King James Version &quot;flagons of wine&quot; in Ho 3:1, the Revised Version (British and American) gives &quot;cakes of raisins,&quot; such as were offered to the gods of the land, the givers of the grape (compare So 2:5).

Gratz considers that the Hebrew words are a corruption of &#x27;asherim and chammanim (&quot;sun images&quot;). Compare Isa 17:8; 27:9. In other passages &quot;cakes&quot; stands alone without &quot;raisins,&quot; but the translation &quot;cakes of raisins&quot; is given in 2Sa 6:19; 1Ch 16:3; So 2:5 (the King James Version &quot;flagons&quot;); Isa 16:7 margin &quot;foundations.&quot;Raisins are today, as of old, prepared in considerable quantities in Palestine, especially at es-Salt, East of the Jordan.

Rakkath was one of the fortified cities in Naphtali (Jos 19:35). It is named between Hammath and Chinnereth. Hammath is identified with the hot baths to the South of Tiberias. There are traces of ancient fortifications here. The rabbis think that Tiberias was built on the site of Rakkath. Certain it is that Herod&#x27;s town was built upon an ancient site, the graves of the old inhabitants being disturbed in digging the new foundations (Neubauer, Geog. du Talmud, 208).W. Ewing</p>

Ram as the son of Hezron appears more likely than Ram the son of Jerahmeel, since, according to the narratives of 1 and 2 Samuel, David cannot have been a Jerahmeelite.(2) Name of Elihu&#x27;s family (Job 32:2). It is an open question as to whether Ram should be taken as a purely fictitious name, invented by the author of the Elihu speeches, or whether it is that of some obscure Arab tribe. In Ge 22:21 Aram is a nephew of Buz (compare Elihu the Buzite), and the conjecture was at one time advanced that Ram was a contraction of Aram; but this theory is no longer held to be tenable. The suggestion that the initial &quot;a&quot; (the Hebrew letter, &#x27;aleph) has been changed by a scribal error into &quot;h&quot; (the Hebrew letter, he) is more acceptable. Rashi, the rabbinical commentator, takes the quaint position that Ram is identical with Abraham.Horace J. Wolf</p>

Only in this passage is the place referred to. It is probably identical with the modern er-Rameh, a large Christian village on the highway from Cafed to the coast, about 8 miles West-Southwest of that city. To the North rises the mountain range which forms the southern boundary of Upper Galilee. In the valley to the South there is much rich land cultivated by the villagers. The olives grown here are very fine, and fruitful vineyards cover many of the surrounding slopes. No remains of antiquity are to be seen above ground; but the site is one likely to have been occupied in ancient times.(2) Rhama: A city that is mentioned only once, on the boundary of Asher (Jos 19:29). The line of the boundary cannot be followed with certainty; but perhaps we may identify Ramah with the modern Ramiyeh, a village situated on a hill which rises in the midst of a hollow, some 13 miles Southeast of Tyre, and 12 miles East of the Ladder of Tyre. To the Southwest is a marshy lake which dries up in summer. Traces of antiquity are found in the cisterns, a large reservoir and many sarcophagi. To the West is the high hill Belat, with ancient ruins, and remains of a temple of which several columns are still in situ.(3) Codex Vaticanus Rhama; Codex Alexandrinus Iama, and other forms: A city in the territory of Benjamin named between Gibeon and Beeroth (Jos 18:25). The Levite thought of it as a possible resting-place for himself and his concubine on their northward journey (Jud 19:13). The palm tree of Deborah was between this and Bethel (Jud 4:5). Baasha, king of Samaria, sought to fortify Ramah against Asa, king of Judah. The latter frustrated the attempt, and carried off the materials which Bassha had collected, and with them fortified against him Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah (1Ki 15:17; 2Ch 16:5). Here the captain of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s guard released Jeremiah after he had been carried in bonds from Jerusalem (Jer 40:1). It figures in Isaiah&#x27;s picture of the Assyrians&#x27; approach (Isa 10:29). It is named by Hosea in connection with Gibeah (5:8), and is mentioned as being reoccupied after the exile (Ezr 2:26; Ne 7:30). It was near the traditional tomb of Rachel (Jer 31:15; compare 1Sa 10:2; Mt 2:18, the King James Version &quot;Rama&quot;).From the passages cited we gather that Ramah lay some distance to the North of Gibeah, and not far from Gibeon and Beeroth. The first is identified with Tell el-Ful, about 3 miles North of Jerusalem. Two miles farther North is er-Ram. Gibeon (el-Jib) is about 3 miles West of er-Ram, and Beeroth (el-Bireh) is about 4 miles to the North Eusebius, Onomasticon places Ramah 6 Roman miles North of Jerusalem; while Josephus (Ant., VIII, xii, 3) sa...</p>

The Septuagint seems to have supposed that the name referred to the &quot;heaving&quot; or throwing up of the jaw-bone. The Hebrew, however, corresponds to the form used in other placenames, such as Ramath-mizpeh, and must be read as &quot;Ramah of Lehi.&quot; The name Lehi may have been given because of some real or imagined likeness in the place to the shape of a jaw-bone (Jud 15:9,14,19).

It is first mentioned in connection with the appointment of the Cities of Refuge (De 4:43; Jos 20:8). It was assigned to the Merarite Levites (Jos 21:38; 1Ch 6:80). In these four passages it is called &quot;Ramoth in Gilead&quot; (ramoth ba-gil&#x27;adh). This form is given wrongly by the King James Version in 1Ki 22:3. In all other places the form &quot;Ramoth-gilead&quot; is used.e to the shape of a jaw-bone (Jud 15:9,14,19). It may have been in Wady es-Sarar, not far from Zorah and Timnath; but the available data do not permit of certain identification.1. History:Here Ben-geber was placed in charge of one of Solomon&#x27;s administrative districts (1Ki 4:13), which included Havvoth-jair and &quot;the region of Argob, which is in Bashan.&quot; The city was taken from Omri by the Syrians under Ben-hadad I (Ant., VIII, xv, 3 ff), and even after the defeat of Ben-hadad at Aphek they remained masters of this fortress. In order to recover it for Israel Ahab invited Jehoshaphat of Judah to accompany him in a campaign. Despite the discouragement of Micalab, the royal pair set out on the disastrous enterprise. In their attack on the city Ahab fought in disguise, but was mortally wounded by an arrow from a bow drawn &quot;at a venture&quot; (1Ki 22:1-40; 2Ch 18). The attempt was renewed by Ahab&#x27;s son Joram; but his father&#x27;s ill fortune followed him, and, heavily wounded, he retired for healing to Jezreel (2Ki 8:28 ff; 2Ch 22:5 f). During the king&#x27;s absence from the camp at Ramoth-gilead Jehu was there anointed king of Israel by Elisha (2Ki 9:1 ff; 2Ch 22:7). He proved a swift instrument of vengeance against the doomed house of Ahab. According to Josephus (Ant., IX, vi, 1) the city was taken before Joram&#x27;s departure. This is confirmed by 2Ki 9:14 ff. The place is not mentioned again, unless, indeed, it be identical with &quot;Mizpeh&quot; in 1 Macc 5:35.2. Identification:It is just possible that Ramoth-gilead corresponds to MIZPAH, (1), and to RAMATH-MIZPEH. The spot where Laban and Jacob parted is called both Galeed and Mizpah. Ramath may become Ramoth, as we see in the case of Ramah of the South.Merrill identifies the city with Jerash, the splendid ruins of which lie in Wady ed-Deir, North of the Jabbok. He quotes the Bah Talmud (Makkoth 9b) as placing the Cities of Refuge in pairs, so that those on the East of the Jordan are opposite those on the West Shechem, being the middle one of the three West of the Jordan, should have Ramorb-gilead nearly opposite to it on the East, and this would place its site at Gerasa, the modern Jerash (Hastings Dictionary of the Bible, under the word). But the words of the Talmud must not be interpreted too strictly. It seems very probable that Golan lay far South of a line drawn due East from Qedes (Kedesh-naphtali). No remains have been discover...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ranj: &quot;Range&quot; and &quot;rank&quot; have the same derivation, and in the sense of a &quot;row&quot; (of men, etc.) they were formerly interchangeable. &quot;Range&quot; with this meaning is found in 2Ki 11:8,15 the King James Version parallel 2Ch 23:14 (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;rank&quot;; sedherah, &quot;row&quot;). Hence, &quot;to range&quot; is &quot;to set in a line&quot; (Judith 2:16; 2 Macc 12:20, diatasso) or &quot;to move in a line&quot; or, simply, &quot;to roam,&quot; whence &quot;a ranging bear&quot; (Pr 28:15; shaqaq, &quot;run to and fro&quot;). A cooking &quot;range&quot; is a stove on which pots, etc., can be set in a row, but the kirayim of Le 11:35 is a much more primitive affair, composed, probably, of two plates (kirayim is a dual). In Job 39:8 &quot;range of the mountains&quot; is good modern use, but ythr, should be pointed yathur (not yethur as in Massoretic Text) and connected with tur, &quot;search.&quot; So translate. &quot;He searcheth out the mountains as his pasture.&quot;Burton Scott Easton</p>

Apostolic Teaching5. To Whom Was the Ransom Paid?(1) Not to Satan(2) To Divine Justice(a) Redemption by Price(b) Redemption by PowerLITERATURE1. Usage by Christ:The supremely important instance is the utterance of the Lord Jesus Christ as reported by Matthew and Mark (Mt 20:28; Mr 10:45), and in looking at it we shall be able, by way of illustration, to glance at the Old Testament passages. The context refers to the dispute among the disciples concerning position in the Kingdom, with their misconception of the true nature of Christ&#x27;s Kingdom. Christ makes use of the occasion to set forth the great law of service as determining the place of honor in that Kingdom, and illustrates and enforces it by showing that its greatest exemplification is to be found in His own mission: &quot;For the Son of man also came not to be ministered unto, but to minister&quot; (Mr 10:45). His ministry, however, was to pass into the great act of sacrifice, of which all other acts of self-sacrifice on the part of His people would be but a faint reflection--&quot;and to give his life (soul) a ransom for many&quot; (same place). He thus gives a very clear intimation of the purpose and meaning of His death; the clearest of all the intimations reported by the synoptists. The word He uses bears a well-established meaning, and is accurately rendered by our word &quot;ransom,&quot; a price paid to secure the freedom of a slave or to set free from liabilities and charges, and generally the deliverance from calamity by paying the forfeit. The familiar verb luo, &quot;to loose,&quot; &quot;to set free,&quot; is the root, then lutron, that which secures the freedom, the payment or forfeit; thence come the cognate verb lutroo, &quot;to set free upon payment of a ransom,&quot; &quot;to redeem&quot;; lutrosis, &quot;the actual setting free,&quot; &quot;the redemption,&quot; and lutrotes, &quot;the redeemer.&quot; The favorite New Testament word for &quot;redemption&quot; is the compound form, apolutrosis.2. Old Testament Usage--the Law:The word lutron was common in Greek classical literature, constantly bearing the sense of &quot;ransom price,&quot; and was frequently connected with ritual usage, with sacrifice and expiation. But for the full explanation of our Lord&#x27;s great thought we have to look to the Old Testament usage. The two leading Hebrew verbs translated in our version by &quot;redeem,&quot; are generally rendered in the Septuagint by lutroo, and derivatives of these words conveying the idea of the actual ...</p>

The purpose of his mission is, in accordance with his name, to cure Tobit of blindness, and to deliver Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, from the power of the evil spirit Asmodaeus (Tobit 3:8; 12:14). Later, in addition, when he reveals himself (Tobit 12:15), he declares that he is &quot;one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and go in before the glory of the Holy One.&quot; These seven angels are derived, according to Dr. Kohut, from the seven Am-shaspands (Amesha-spentas) of Zoroastrianism (compare Re 4:5). At the head of the elaborate angelology of the Enoch books there are &quot;four presences,&quot; and Raphael is one of them (En 40:9; 54:6). In the first of these passages Raphael is the healer; in the second, he with Michael, Gabriel and Phanuel lead the wicked away to punishment. These four presences seem related to the four &quot;living creatures&quot; of Ezekiel (1:5) and of the Apocalypse (Re 4:6). While this is the general representation of Raphael&#x27;s position in Enoch, in 20:3 he is named among the angels who &quot;watch,&quot; whose number according to the Greek text is seven. Raphael shared in the function assigned to the archangels, in the Oracula Sibyllina, of leading souls to the judgment seat of God (II, 215, Alexandre&#x27;s text). He occupies a prominent place in Jewish medieval writings; he with Michael and Gabriel cured Abraham (Yoma&#x27; 37a); according to the book Zohar, Raphael conveyed to Adam a book containing 72 kinds of wisdom in 670 writings. The painters of the Renaissance frequently depicted Raphael.J. E. H. Thomson</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ra&#x27;-vn (`orebh; korax; Latin Corvus corax): A large family of the smaller birds of prey belonging to the genus Corvus corax. A bird of such universal distribution that it is known from Iceland to Japan, all over Asia, Europe and Africa, but almost extinct and not of general distribution in our own country. In no land is it more numerous than in Palestine In general appearance it resembles the crow, but is much larger, being almost two feet long, of a glossy black, with whiskers around the beak, and rather stiff-pointed neck feathers. A bird exhibiting as much intelligence as any, and of a saucy, impudent disposition, it has been an object of interest from the beginning. It has been able to speak sentences of a few words when carefully taught, and by its uncanny acts has made itself a bird surrounded by superstition, myth, fable, and is connected with the religious rites of many nations. It is partially a carrion feeder, if offal or bodies are fresh; it also eats the young of other birds and very small animals and seeds, berries and fruit, having as varied a diet as any bird. It is noisy, with a loud, rough, emphatic cry, and its young are clamorous feeding time.Aristotle wrote that ravens drove their young from their location and forced them to care for themselves from the time they left the nest. This is doubtful. Bird habits and characteristics change only with slow ages of evolution. Our ravens of today are, to all intents, the same birds as those of Palestine in the time of Moses, and ours follow the young afield for several days and feed them until the cawing, flapping youngsters appear larger than the parents. In Pliny&#x27;s day, ravens had been taught to speak, and as an instance of their cunning he records that in time of drought a raven found a bucket containing a little water beside a grave and raised it to drinking level by dropping in stones.Palestine has at least 8 different species of ravens. This bird was the first sent out by Noah in an effort to discover if the flood were abating (Ge 8:6-8). Because it partially fed on carrion it was included among the abominations (see Le 11:15; De 14:14). On 1Ki 17:4-6, see ELIJAH and the present writer&#x27;s Birds of the Bible, 401-3. Among the marvels of creation and providence in Job 38:41, we have this mention of the raven,&quot;Who provideth for the raven his prey,When his young ones cry unto God,And wander for lack of food?&quot;The answer to this question is in Ps 147:9:&quot;He giveth to the beast his food,And to the young ravens which cry.&quot;Both these quotations point out the fact that the young are peculiarly noisy. In Pr 30:17 it is indicated that the ravens, as well as eagles, vultures and hawks, found the eye of prey the vulnerable point, and so attacked it first. The Hebrew `orebh means &quot;black,&quot; and for this reason was applied to the raven, so the reference to the locks of the bridegroom in the So of Solomon becomes clear (So 5:11). The raven is one of the birds indicated to prey upon the ruins of Edom (...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">rep&#x27;-ing (qatsar; therizo): Reaping in ancient times, as at present, consisted in either pulling up the grain by the roots or cutting it with a sickle (see SICKLE), and then binding the stalks into bundles to be carried to the threshing-floor. If the Egyptian sculptures are true to life, reaping was sometimes divided into two operations, the heads of grain and the stalks being reaped separately. In Palestine and Syria both pulling and cutting are still practiced, the former when the ground is stony and the spears scarce. Even where the sickle is used, much of the grain comes up by the roots, owing to the toughness of the dried stalks or the dullness of the sickle. The reaper sometimes wears pieces of cane on the fingers of the hand which gathers the grain in order to protect them from injury by the sharp grasses or the sickle. There were definite laws established by the Hebrews in regard to reaping (Le 19:9; 23:10; 25:5,11; De 16:9). Samuel mentions the task of reaping the harvest as one of the requirements which would be made by the king for whom the people were clamoring (1Sa 8:12).Figurative:The certainty of the consequences of good and evil doing were often typified by the sowing and the reaping of harvests (Job 4:8; Pr 22:8; Ho 8:7; 10:12,13; 2Co 9:6; Ga 6:7,8). &quot;They that sow in tears shall reap in joy&quot; is found in the liberated captives&#x27; song (Ps 126:5). &quot;He that regardeth the clouds shall not reap,&quot; i.e. a lack of faith in God&#x27;s care will be punished (Ec 11:4); compare also the lesson of trust drawn from the birds (Mt 6:26; Lu 12:24). Sowing and not reaping the harvest is mentioned as a punishment for disobedience (Job 31:8; Jer 12:13; Mic 6:15). Reaping where he sowed not, showed the injustice of the landlord (Mt 25:26), as did also the withholding of the reapers&#x27; wages (Jas 5:4). In God&#x27;s Kingdom there is a division of labor: &quot;He that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together&quot; (Joh 4:36-38). In John&#x27;s vision he saw an angel reap the earth (Re 14:15,16).See AGRICULTURE; GLEANING.James A. Patch</p>

In fact, the family is there carried down just so far as is necessary in order to introduce this woman, for whose subsequent appearance and role the genealogy is obviously intended as a preparation. All this branch of the family of Terah had remained in Aram when Abraham and Lot had migrated to Canaan, and it is at Haran, &quot;the city of Nahor,&quot; that we first meet Rebekah, when in Genesis 24 she is made known to Abraham&#x27;s servant at the well before the gate.That idyllic narrative of the finding of a bride for Isaac is too familiar to need rehearsal and too simple to require comment. Besides, the substance both of that story and of the whole of Rebekah&#x27;s career is treated in connection with the sketches of the other actors in the same scenes. Yet we note from the beginning the maiden&#x27;s decision of character, which appears in every line of the narrative, and prepares the reader to find in subsequent chapters the positive, ambitious and energetic woman that she there shows herself.Though the object of her husband&#x27;s love (Ge 24:67), Rebekah bore him no children for 20 years (Ge 25:20,26). Like Sarah, she too was barren, and it was only after that score of years and after the special intercession of Isaac that God at length granted her twin sons. &quot;The purpose of God according to election,&quot; as Paul expresses the matter in Ro 9:11, was the cause of that strange oracle to the wondering, inquiring parents, &quot;The elder shall serve the younger&quot; (Ge 25:23).Whether because of this oracle or for some other reason, it was that younger son, Jacob, who became the object of his mother&#x27;s special love (Ge 25:28). She it was who led him into the deception practiced upon Isaac (Ge 27:5-17), and she it was who devised the plan for extricating Jacob from the dangerous situation into which that deception had brought him (Ge 27:42-46). When the absence of Jacob from home became essential to his personal safety, Rebekah proposed her own relations in Aram as the goal of his journey, and gave as motive the desirability of Jacob&#x27;s marrying from amo...</p>

On the death of Abner (2Sa 3:30) the two brothers treacherously entered Ish-bosheth&#x27;s house, when at noon he was resting and helpless, beheaded him, and escaped with the head to David at Hebron (2Sa 4:6-8). They expected to receive reward and honor from David for the foul deed, which left him without a rival for the throne of all Israel. But the just and noble-minded king ordered their immediate execution (2Sa 4:9-12), as in the case of the Amalekite, who asserted that he had killed Saul (2Sa 1). For some reason the Beerothites left their own town and fled to Gittaim, another town in Benjamin, where they were still living when the Books of Samuel were written (2Sa 4:3).(2) The more prominent of the men bearing this name was a Kenite (see KENITES), a descendant of Hammath (1Ch 2:55). A part of the Kenite tribe joined the Israelites during the wilderness wanderings (Nu 10:29-32; Jud 1:16; 4:17), becoming identified with the tribe of Judah, although Heber and Jael his wife were settled in Northern Palestine (Jud 4:17). Rechab was the ancestor or founder of a family, or order, in Israel known as the Rechabites, who at various times were conspicuous in the religious life of the nation. The most notable member of this family was Jehonadab (2Ki 10:15ff, 23), or Jonadab, as he is called in Jer 35. Jehonadab was a zealous Yahweh-worshipper and took part with Jehu in the extirpation of Baal-worship and the house of Ahab. He set for his descendants a vow of asceticism: that they should drink no wine, nor plant fields or vineyards, nor build nor live in houses throughout their generations (Jer 35:6,7). That must have been a singular feature in Palestinian life: the simple, nomadic life of this family from generation to generation in the midst of settled agricultural and industrial conditions! They followed this simple life in order to guard against the enervating tendencies of sensualism, and as a covenant of fidelity to Yahweh, to whom they wholly devoted themselves when they joined themselves to Israel. Jeremiah used the Rechabites, who had been driven into Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s investment of the land, as an object-lesson to covenant-breaking Judah. The Rechabites, hungry and thirsty, refused wine when it was set before them, because of the command of their ancestor Jonadab (Jer 35:8-10); but Judah refused to heed Yahweh&#x27;s commands or to keep His covenant (Jer 35:14,15).If the Rechab of Ne 3:14 is the same as this Kenite, then his descendant Malchijah, who assisted Nehemiah in rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem, may have abandoned the vow of his ancestors, for he was &quot;ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem&quot; (i.e. &quot;house of the vineyard&quot;).Edward Mack</p>

The Terms(1) New Testament Usage(2) Old Testament Usage(3) Special Passage in 1 Samuel 29:4(4) Usage in the Apocrypha2. Non-doctrinal Passage--Matthew 5:243. Doctrinal Passages  (1) Romans 5(2) 2 Corinthians 5:18-20(3) Ephesians 2:16(4) Colossians 1:20-22LITERATURE1. The Terms:(1) New Testament Usage.In the last case, Mt 5:24, the word is not used in a doctrinal sense, though its use is very helpful in considering the force of the other terms. All the other instances are in Paul&#x27;s Epistles (Ro 5:10; 1Co 7:11; 2Co 5:18-20, the verb; Ro 5:11; 11:15; 2Co 5:18,19, the noun; Eph 2:16; Col 1:22, the compound). The word &quot;reconcile&quot; has a double meaning and usage, and the context must in each case determine how it is to be taken. The great doctrine is the reconciliation of God and men, but the question to be decided is whether it is God who is reconciled to men, or men who are reconciled to God, and different schools of theology emphasize one side or the other. The true view embraces both aspects. The word &quot;to reconcile&quot; means literally to exchange, to bring into a changed relationship. Some maintain that it is only a change in the sinner that is intended, a laying aside of his enmity, and coming into peaceful relations with God. But that manifestly does not exhaust the meaning, nor is it in the great Pauline passages the primary and dominant meaning.(2) Old Testament Usage.The Old Testament usage does not materially help in the elucidation of the New Testament terms, for though the word occurs in a number of passages in the King James Version, it is in the Revised Version (British and American) generally changed to &quot;atonement,&quot; which more accurately represents the Hebrew kaphar, which is generally rendered by &quot;atonement,&quot; and by hilaskomai or exilaskomai in the Greek (In one passage of the New Testament (Heb 2:17), the phrase &quot;to make reconciliation&quot; represents the Greek hilaskomai, and is better rendered in the Revised Version (British and American) by &quot;to make propitiation.&quot;) The making atonement or propitiation is the basis of the reconciliation, the means of its accomplishment, and the fact that the translators of the King James Version sometimes rendered kaphar by &quot;reconcile&quot; shows that they understood reconciliation to have the Godward aspect. Whatever may be said of the nature of the atonement or propitiation in the old dispensation, it was something contemplated as appeasing or satisfying, or at least in some way affecting God so as to make Him willing, or render it possible for Him, to enter into, or abide in, gracious relations with men. In one passage in the Old Testament where &quot;reconciliation&quot; occurs (2Ch 29:24) it represents a different Hebrew word, but here the Revised Version (British and American) has changed it into &quot;sin-offering,&quot; which is in harmony with the general meaning and usage of...</p>

In 2Ki 5:3,6,7,11, &quot;to restore to health&quot; is &#x27;acaph. In its intransitive sense &quot;recover&quot; is chiefly the translation of chayah, &quot;to live,&quot; &quot;revive&quot; (2Ki 1:2, etc.; Isa 38:9,21). &quot;Recover&quot; appears only twice in the King James Version of the New Testament; Mr 16:18 (for kalos hexousin) and 2Ti 2:26 (from ananepho, the Revised Version margin &quot;Greek: `return to soberness&#x27; &quot;); but the Revised Version (British and American) has &quot;recover&quot; for &quot;do well&quot; in Joh 11:12 (sothesetai; margin &quot;Greek: `be saved&#x27;&quot;). &quot;Recovering&quot; (of sight) (anablepsis) occurs in Lu 4:18.W.

Name2. Peculiarities3. Old Testament References4. Passage through the Red Sea by the IsraelitesObjections(1) Steep Banks of the Channel(2) Walls Formed by the Water(3) The East Winds(4) The Miraculous Set AsideLITERATURE1. Name:The Hebrew name yam-cuph has given rise to much controversy. Yam is the general word for sea, and when standing alone may refer to the Mediterranean, the Dead Sea, the Red Sea, or the Sea of Galilee. In several places it designates the river Nile or Euphrates. Cuph means a rush or seaweed such as abounds in the lower portions of the Nile and the upper portions of the Red Sea. It was in the cuph on the brink of the river that the ark of Moses was hidden (Ex 2:3,5). But as this word does not in itself mean red, and as that is not the color of the bulrush, authorities are much divided as to the reason for this designation. Some have supposed that it was called red from the appearance of the mountains on the western coast, others from the red color given to the water by the presence of zoophytes, or red coral, or some species of seaweed. Others still, with considerable probability, suppose that the name originated in the red or copper color of the inhabitants of the bordering Arabian peninsula. But the name yam-cuph, though applied to the whole sea, was especially used with reference to the northern part, which is alone mentioned in the Bible, and to the two gulfs (Suez and Aqabah) which border the Sinaitic Peninsula, especially the Gulf of Suez.2. Pecularities:The Red Sea has a length of 1,350 miles and an extreme breadth of 205 miles. It is remarkable that while it has no rivers flowing into it and the evaporation from its surface is enormous, it is not much salter than the ocean, from which it is inferred that there must be a constant influx of water from the Indian Ocean through the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, together with an outflow of the more saline water beneath the surface. The deepest portion measures 1,200 fathoms. Owing to the lower land levels which prevailed in recent geological times, the Gulf of Suez formerly extended across the lowland which separates it from the Bitter Lakes, a distance of 15 or 20 miles now traversed by the Suez Canal, which encountered no elevation more than 30 ft. above tide. In early historic times the Gulf ended at Ismailia at the head of Lake Timsah. North of this the land rises to a height of more than 50 ft. and for a long time furnished a road leading from Africa into Asia. At a somewhat earlier geological (middle and late Tertiary) period the depression of the land was such that this bridge was also submerged, so that the Red Sea and the Mediterranean were connected by a broad expanse of water which overflowed the whole surface of Lower Egypt.The evidence of the more recent depression ...</p>

Gradual Moralizing of Idea of Redemption2. Redemption as Life in Individual3. Redemption as Social4. Redemption as Process5. Moral Implications in Scriptural Idea of Redeemer6. Uniqueness of Son of God as RedeemerLITERATUREThe idea of redemption in the Old Testament takes its start from the thought of property (Le 25:26; Ru 4:4). Money is paid according to law to buy back something which must be delivered or rescued (Nu 3:51; Ne 5:8). From this start the word &quot;redemption&quot; throughout the Old Testament is used in the general sense of deliverance. God is the Redeemer of Israel in the sense that He is the Deliverer of Israel (De 9:26; 2Sa 7:23; 1Ch 17:21; Isa 52:3). The idea of deliverance includes deliverance from all forms of evil lot, from national misfortune (Isa 52:9; 63:9; compare Lu 2:38), or from plague (Ps 78:35,52), or from calamity of any sort (Ge 48:16; Nu 25:4,9). Of course, the general thought of the relation of Israel to God was that God had both a claim upon Israel (De 15:15) and an obligation toward Israel (1Ch 17:21; Ps 25:22). Israel belonged to Him, and it was by His own right that He could move into the life of Israel so as to redeem Israel. On the other hand, obligation was upon Him to redeem Israel.In the New Testament the idea of redemption has more a suggestion of ransom. Men are held under the curse of the law (Ga 3:13), or of sin itself (Ro 7:23 f). The Redeemer purchases their deliverance by offering Himself as payment for their redemption (Eph 1:7; 1Pe 1:18).1. Gradual Moralizing of Idea of Redemption:Throughout both the Old Testament and the New Testament there is to be observed a gradual moralizing of the meaning of redemption. The same process of moralizing has continued throughout all the Christian ages. Starting with the idea of redemption price, conceived almost in material terms, religious thought has advanced to conceptions entirely moral and spiritual. Through the Scriptures, too, the idea of redemption becomes more specffic with the progress of Christian revelation. In the beginning God is the Redeemer from distresses of all kinds. He redeems from calamity and from sorrows. This general idea, of course, persists throughout the revelation and enters largely into our thinking of today, but the growing moral discernment of the Biblical writers comes to attach more and more importance to sin as the chief disturber of man&#x27;s welfare. We would not minimize the force of the Scriptural idea that God is the Deliverer from all misfortune to which man falls heir, but the Scriptural emphasis moves more and more to deliverance from sin. Paul states this deliverance as a deliverance from the law which brings sin out into expression, but we must not conceive his idea in any artificial fashion. He would have men delivered not only from the law, but also from the consequences of evi...</p>

Some refer to different uses to which a reed is put, e.g. a cross-beam of a balance, a walking-stick, a measuring rod, and a pen (see above), but apart from this qaneh is a word used for at least two essentially different things:(1) an ordinary reed, and(2) some sweet-smelling substance.(1) The most common reed in Palestine is the Arundo donax (Natural Order Gramineae), known in Arabic as qacabfarasi, &quot;Persian reed.&quot; It grows in immense quantities in the Jordan valley along the river and its tributaries and at the oases near the Dead Sea, notably around `Ain Feshkhah at the northwest corner. It is a lofty reed, often 20 ft. high, of a beautiful fresh green in summer when all else is dead and dry, and of a fine appearance from a distance in the spring months when it is in full bloom and the beautiful silky panicles crown the top of every reed. The &quot;covert of the reed&quot; (Job 40:21) shelters a large amount of animal and bird life. This reed will answer to almost all the requirements of the above references.(2) Qaneh is in Jer 6:20 qualified qaneh ha-Tobh, &quot;sweet&quot; or &quot;pleasant cane,&quot; and in Ex 30:23, qeneh bhosem, &quot;sweet calamus,&quot; or, better, a &quot;cane of fragrance.&quot; So 4:14; Isa 43:24; Eze 27:19 all apparently refer to the same thing, though in these passages the qaneh is unqualified. It was an ingredient of the holy oil (Ex 30:23); it was imported from a distance (Jer 6:20; Eze 27:19), and it was rare and costly (Isa 43:24). It may have been the &quot;scented calamus&quot; (Axorus calamus) of Pliny (NH, xii.48), or some other aromatic scented reed or flag, or, as some think, some kind o...</p>

The reed is described as 6 cubits long, &quot;of a cubit and a handbreadth each,&quot; i.e. the cubit used was a handbreadth longer than the common cubit (see CUBIT; WEIGHTS AND MEASURES; TEMPLE). In the Apocalypse this idea of a measuring reed reappears for measuring the temple (Re 11:1) and the holy city (Re 21:15,16, &quot;a golden reed&quot;).

The same word is rendered also &quot;tried&quot; (Ps 66:10); &quot;melt&quot; (Jer 6:29 the King James Version); &quot;purge&quot; (Isa 1:25). (2) zaqaq, literally, to &quot;strain&quot; or &quot;sift.&quot; In the case of silver and gold the term probably referred to some washing process in connection with refining, as in Mal 3:3 both tsaraph and zaqaq are used (1Ch 28:18; 29:4; Job 28:1). The same word in Isa 25:6 referred to the straining of wine. Greek puroo, in the passive, literally, &quot;to be ignited,&quot; is translated &quot;refined,&quot; in Re 1:15; 3:18.The ancient process of refining gold has already been described under METALLURGY (which see). Most of the Bible references are to the refining of silver (Pr 25:4; Zec 13:9; Isa 48:10). The silver used by the ancients was probably obtained by smelting lead sulfide ore, rich in silver (argentiferous galena). After the ore had been reduced to a metallic condition, the lead was separated from the silver by blowing hot air over the surface of the melted metal. The lead was thus changed to lead oxide which, in a powdered condition, was driven away by the air blast. The resulting lead oxide, called in the Bible silver dross, was used for glazing pottery (Pr 26:23), a use to which it is still put by Syrian potters. The description of refining in Eze 22:18-22 may indicate that a flux (compare &quot;as with lye,&quot; Isa 1:25 the American Revised Version margin) was sometimes added to the melted metal to dissolve the oxides of copper, lead, tin and iron as they formed, thus leaving the silver pure. Crude processes similar to those described above are used in the Taurus Mountains today.Figurative:In the various Bible references the refining of precious metals is used figuratively to illustrate the kind of trial God&#x27;s children are called upon to go through. If they are of the right metal the dross will finally be blown away, leaving pure, clear, shining silver. If of base metal they will be like the dross described in Jer 6:29,30. The refiner may blow fiercely, but in vain, for nothing but lead dross appears.James A. Patch</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">`are ha-miqlaT; poleis ton phugadeuterion (compare 1 Macc 10:28), and other forms):1. Location:Six cities, three on each side of the Jordan, were set apart and placed in the hands of the Levites, to serve as places of asylum for such as might shed blood unwittingly. On the East of the Jordan they were Bezer in the lot of Reuben, Ramoth-gilead in the tribe of Gad, and Golan in the territory of Manasseh. On the West of the Jordan they were Hebron in Judah, Shechem in Mt. Ephraim, and Kedesh in Naphtali (Nu 35:6,14; Jos 20:2,7 ff; 21:13,21,27,32,38; Bezer is named in Jos 21:36, but not described as a City of Refuge). An account of these cities is given in separate articles under their names. De 19:2 speaks of three cities thus to be set apart, referring apparently to the land West of the Jordan.2. Purpose:From time immemorial in the East, if a man were slain the duty of avenging him has lain as a sacred obligation upon his nearest relative. In districts where more primitive conditions prevail, even to this day, the distinction between intentional and unintentional killing is not too strictly observed, and men are often done to death in revenge for what was the purest accident. To prevent such a thing where possible, and to provide for a right administration of justice, these cities were instituted. Open highways were to be maintained along, which the manslayer might have an unobstructed course to the city gate.3. Regulations:The regulations concerning the Cities of Refuge are found in Nu 35; De 19:1-13; Jos 20. Briefly, everything was to be done to facilitate the flight of the manslayer, lest the avenger of blood, i.e. the nearest of kin, should pursue him with hot heart, and, overtaking him, should smite him mortally. Upon reaching the city he was to be received by the elders and his case heard. If this was satisfactory, they gave him asylum until a regular trial could be carried out. They took him, apparently, to the city or district from which he had fled, and there, among those who knew him, witnesses were examined. If it were proved that he was not a willful slayer, that he had no grudge against the person killed, and had shown no sign of purpose to injure him, then he was declared innocent and conducted back to the city in which he had taken refuge, where he must stay until the death of the high priest. Then he was free to return home in safety. Until that event he must on no account go beyond the city boundaries. If he did, the avenger of blood might slay him without blame. On the other hand, if he were found guilty of deliberate murder, there was no more protection for him. He was handed over to the avenger of blood who, with his own hand, took the murderer&#x27;s life. Blood-money, i.e. money paid in compensation for the murder, in settlement of the avenger&#x27;s claim, was in no circumstances permitted; nor could the refugee be ransomed, so that he might &quot;come again to dwell in the land&quot; until the death of the high priest (Nu 35:32).A similar right...</p>

Second Biblical Sense (Spiritual)II. THE BIBLICAL DOCTRINE OF REGENERATION1. In the Old Testament2. In the Teaching of Jesus3. In Apostolic TeachingIII. LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOCTRINEIV. PRESENT SIGNIFICANCELITERATUREI. The Term Explained.The theological term &quot;regeneration&quot; is the Latin translation of the Greek expression palingenesia, occurring twice in the New Testament (Mt 19:28; Tit 3:5). The word is usually written paliggenesia, in classical Greek. Its meaning is different in the two passages, though an easy transition of thought is evident.1. First Biblical Sense (Eschatological):In Mt 19:28 the word refers to the restoration of the world, in which sense it is synonymical to the expressions apokatastasis panton, &quot;restoration of all things&quot; (Ac 3:21; the verb is found in Mt 17:11, apokatastsei panta, &quot;shall restore all things&quot;), and anapsuxis, &quot;refreshing&quot; (Ac 3:19), which signifies a gradual transition of meaning to the second sense of the word under consideration. It is supposed that regeneration in this sense denotes the final stage of development of all creation, by which God&#x27;s purposes regarding the same are fully realized, when &quot;all things (are put) in subjection under his feet&quot; (1Co 15:27). This is a &quot;regeneration in the proper meaning of the word, for it signifies a renovation of all visible things when the old is passed away, and heaven and earth are become new&quot; (compare Re 21:1). To the Jew the regeneration thus prophesied was inseparably connected with the reign of the Messiah.We find this word in the same or very similar senses in profane literature. It is used of the renewal of the world in Stoical philosophy. Josephus (Ant., XI, iii, 9) speaks of the anaktesis kai paliggenesia tes patridos, &quot;a new foundation and regeneration of the fatherland,&quot; after the return from the Babylonian captivity. Philo (ed. Mangey, ii.144) uses the word, speaking of the post-diluvial epoch of the earth, as of a new world, and Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (xi.1), of a periodical restoration of all things, laying stress upon the constant recurrence and uniformity of all happenings, which thought the Preacher expressed by &quot;There is no new thing under the sun&quot; (Ec 1:9). In most places, however, where the word occurs in philosophical writings, it is used of the &quot;reincarnation&quot; or &quot;subsequent birth&quot; of the individual, as in the Buddhistic and Pythagorean doctrine of the transmigration of souls (Plut., edition Xylander, ii.998c; Clement of Alexandria, edition Potter, 539) or else of a revival of life (Philo i.159). Cicero uses the word in his letters to Atticus (vi.6) metaphorically of his return from exile, as a new lease of life granted to him.See ESCHATOLOGY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT, IX.2. Second Biblical Sense (Spiritual):This sense is undoubtedly included in the full Biblical conception of the former meaning, for it is unthinkable that a regeneration in the eschatologic...</p>

Rehob is given (Nu 13:21) as the northern limit of Israel as reached by the spies. This agrees with the position assigned to Beth-rehob in the narrative of the settlement of the Danites (Jud 18:28). It is mentioned again along with the kingdom of Zobah in connection with the wars of Saul (1Sa 14:47 Septuagint Lag.), and as having been associated with, Zobah and Maacah against David in the Ammonite war and as having been defeated by him (2Sa 10:6). Robinson sought to identify it with Hunin, but it hardly suits the references. Buhl (GAP, 240) following Thomson (LB, II, 547) seeks it at Paneas (modern Banias). This would suit all the requirements of the capital, Beth-rehob, which might then be the second Rehob, assigned as part of the territory of Sidon to the tribe Asher (Jos 19:28,30; Jud 18:28). We must, however, assign to the kingdom of Rehob a territory extending from the settlements of the Danites to the &quot;entering in of Hamath&quot; or to Libo (modern Leboue), i.e. the Great Plain of Coele-Syria bounded by Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon and within the limits indicated.(2) Two separate towns belonging to Asher (Jos 19:28; 19:30). One of them was given to the Gershonite Levites (Jos 21:31), and one is mentioned as remaining in the hands of the Canaanites (Jud 1:31).(3) Father of Hadadezer, king of Aram Zobah, who was overwhelmed by David at the Euphrates (2Sa 8:3,12).(4) One of the Levites who sealed Nehemiah&#x27;s covenant on the 24th Tishri, 444 BC (Ne 10:11).W.

The Disruption of the Kingdom2. Underlying Causes of Disruption3. Shemaiah Forbids Civil War4. Rehoboam&#x27;s Prosperity5. Shishak&#x27;s Invasion6. His DeathThe son and successor of Solomon, the last king to claim the throne of old Israel and the first king of Judah after the division of the kingdom. He was born circa 978 BC. His mother was Naamah, an Ammonitess. The account of his reign is contained in 1Ki 14:21-31; 2Ch 10-12. The incidents leading to the disruption of the kingdom are told in 1Ki 11:43-12:24; 2Ch 9:31-11:4.1. The Disruption of the Kingdom:Rehoboam was 41 years old (2Ch 12:13) when he began to reign Septuagint 1Ki 12:24 a says 16 years). He ascended the throne at Jerusalem immediately upon his father&#x27;s death with apparently no opposition. North Israel, however, was dissatisfied, and the people demanded that the king meet them in popular assembly at Shechem, the leading city of Northern Israel. True, Israel was no longer, if ever, an elective monarchy. Nevertheless, the people claimed a constitutional privilege, based perhaps on the transaction of Samuel in the election of Saul (1Sa 10:25), to be a party to the conditions under which they would serve a new king and he become their ruler: David, in making Solomon his successor, had ignored this wise provision, and the people, having lost such a privilege by default, naturally deemed their negligence the cause of Solomon&#x27;s burdensome taxes and forced labor. Consequently, they would be more jealous of their rights for the future, and Rehoboam accordingly would have to accede to their demand. Having come together at Shechem, the people agreed to accept Rehoboam as their king on condition that he would lighten the grievous service and burdensome taxes of his father. Rehoboam asked for three days&#x27; time in which to consider the request. Against the advice of men of riper judgment, who assured him that he might win the people by becoming their servant, he chose the counsel of the younger men, who were of his own age, to rule by sternness rather than by kindness, and returned the people a rough answer, saying: &quot;My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions&quot; (1Ki 12:14). Rehoboam, however, misjudged the temper of the people, as well as his own ability. The people, led by Jeroboam, a leader more able than himself, were ready for rebellion, and so force lost the day where kindness might have won. The threat of the king was met by the Marseillaise of the people: &quot;What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David&quot; (1Ki 12:16). Thus the ten tribes dethroned Rehoboam, and elected Jeroboam, their champion and spokesman, their king (see JEROBOAM). Rehoboam, believing in his ability to carry out his threa...</p>

Probably Rebit Ninua:The second of the cities built by Asshur (the Revised Version (British and American) by Nimrod) in Assyria (Ge 10:11,12). Unlike the other three, the exact equivalent of this name is not found in Assyrian literature Fried. Delitzsch points out (Wo lag das Paradies? 260 f) that rechobhoth is the equivalent of the Assyrian rebite, &quot;streets,&quot; and suggests that the site referred to may be the Rebit Ninua, &quot;streets of Nineveh,&quot; mentioned by Sargon of Assyria in connection with the peopling of Maganubba (Khorsabad or Dur-Sarru-kin; see NINEVEH); and it was through this tract that Esar-haddon, his grandson, caused the heads of the kings of Kundi and Sidon to be carried in procession when he returned from his expedition to the Mediterranean.2. Or, Possibly, the Old Capital, Assur:Though the probabilities in favor of Rebit Ninua are great, it is doubtful whether a suburb could have been regarded as a foundation worthy of a primitive ruler, and that a very important city, Assur, the old capital of Assyria, would rather be expected. One of the groups expressing its name is composed of the characters Sag-uru, or, dialectically, Sab-eri, the second element being the original of the Hebrew `ir. As the &quot;center-city,&quot; Assur may have been regarded as the city of broad spaces (rechobhoth)--its ruins are of considerable extent. The German explorers there have made many important discoveries of temples, temple- towers, palaces and streets, the most picturesque in ancient times being the twin tower-temples of Anu (the sky) and Adad (Hadad). The ruins lie on the Tigris, about 50 miles South of Nineveh. It practically ceased to be the capital about the middle of the 8th century BC.See NINEVEH.T. G. Pinches</p>

The name is very uncertain. Winckler (Geschichte, II, 247) identifies him with Ira, the Jairite, who was a &quot;priest to David&quot; (2Sa 20:26 the Revised Version margin); he tries to prove that this Ira (or Jair) was a priest of Bethlehem. Stade (GVI, I, 293, note 1) holds that Shimei and Rei were two officers of David&#x27;s bodyguard. Josephus (Ant., VII, xiv, 4) has ho Daouidou philos, thus making Shimei a &quot;friend,&quot; the courtier of 2Sa 15:37; 16:16, and omitting Rei entirely. This would call for an original reading re`h ha-melekh, or re`eh ha-melekh, and is too wide a variant from the Massoretic Text. Assuming that Rei belongs in the text, it is safe to conjecture that he was an officer of the royal guard.Horace J. Wolf</p>

The verb is malakh, &quot;to be king&quot; (&quot;to reign as king&quot;), &quot;to become king,&quot; &quot;to accede to the throne,&quot; &quot;to assume royal power publicly&quot; and, generally speaking, &quot;to become powerful.&quot; In the New Testament hegemonia, basileia, basileuein. The word is used, either as a noun or as a verb, of Yahweh (God), the Messiah (Christ) and men (kings, etc.); then of such terms as sin, death, grace; of the woman in Revelation and, conditionally, of the Christians; once, ironically, of the Corinthians. &quot;Reign&quot; as a noun referring to the time of reigning occurs in 1Ki 6:1 (Solomon); 2Ki 24:12 (Nebuchadnezzar); 1Ch 4:31 (David; compare 1Ch 29:30); 2Ch 36:20 (&quot;until the reign of the kingdom of Persia&quot;); Ne 12:22 (Darius); Es 2:16 (Ahasuerus); Lu 3:1 (Tiberius Caesar). More often occurs the verb &quot;to reign,&quot; malakh, basileuein. It is applied to:(1) Yahweh at the close of the song of Moses (Ex 15:18); &quot;Yahweh reigneth&quot; (1Ch 16:31; compare Ps 93:1; 96:10; 99:1; Re 19:6); &quot;God reigneth over the nations&quot; (Ps 47:8); &quot;Yahweh of hosts will reign in mount Zion&quot; (Isa 24:23; compare Mic 4:7); &quot;Thy God reigneth&quot; (Isa 52:7); &quot;Thou hast taken thy great power and didst reign&quot; (Re 11:17, meaning probably &quot;thou didst assume thy might&quot;);(2) the Messiah (Christ) as a just and righteous king (Jer 23:5); an eternal king (Lu 1:33; compare Re 11:15); punishing and subduing His enemies (Lu 19:14,27; 1Co 15:25).(3) Men (kings, etc.), in regard to the source of their power (&quot;By me (i.e. the wisdom of God), kings reign&quot; (Pr 8:15)); respecting legitimate succession (2Ch 23:3); meaning &quot;to have power or dominion&quot; (Ge 37:8 and Job 34:30); in regard to an essential characteristic (Isa 32:1); in connection with the covenant of Yahweh with David (Jer 33:21); then the word is used in 1Sa 12:12, where Samuel reminds the children of Israel of their demanding a king of him (compare verse 14); of Saul (1Sa 13:1; compare 1Sa 11:12); of Saul&#x27;s son Ish-bosheth (2Sa 2:10); of David (2Sa 5:4 f; compare 2Sa 3:21); of Adonijah (1Ki 1:11,24; compare 1Ki 2:15); of Solomon (1Ki 1:13); quite frequently of the kings of Judah and Israel (in the Books of Kings and Chronicles); of the kings of Edom (Ge 36:31); of Jabin, king of Canaan, in Razor (Jud 4:2); of Abimelech, Jerubbaal&#x27;s son, in Jotham&#x27;s fable (Jud 9:8-15); of Hanun, king of the Ammonites (2Sa 10:1); of Rezon and his men in Damascus (1Ki 11:24); of Hazael and Ben-hadad, kings of Syria (2Ki 8:15, 13:24); of Esar-haddon, king of Assyria (2Ki 19:37); of Ahasuerus, king of Persia (Es 1:1); of Archelaus (Mt 2:22).(4) In the New Testament the term basileuein, &quot;to reign,&quot; is used to illustrate and emphasize the power of sin, death and grace (Ro 5:14,17,21; 6:12). Sin, the vitiating mental factor, is to be looked upon as being constantly and resolutely bent on maintaining or regaining its hold upon man, its power being exercised and reinforced by the lusts of...</p>

The Dependent StrangerThe family or domestic relations of the Bible include(1) those of consanguinity or blood relationship,(2) affinity or marriage relationship, and(3) legal convention.Those of consanguinity may be divided into lineal and collateral groups; the former are those of parents and children, grandparents and grandchildren, and ancestors and descendants in general; the latter are those of brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts in relation to nephews and nieces, cousins of various degrees, including mere tribesmen and even remoter kinsfolk. The relations of affinity include besides that of husband and wife or concubine, the relations among rival wives, and their children, those of father-in-law and mother-in-law in relation to son-in-law and daughter-in-law, and those of brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. The domestic relations based on legal convention are either legal fictions or the results of agreement: among the former we must include those of foster-father or mother and foster-children; among the latter the relations between master and the various classes of servants and slaves held by the ancient Hebrews, those between host and guest, especially where they became covenant brothers, and between the citizen and the stranger who had attached himself to him for his protection.I. Consanguinity.1. In General:Genealogies were carefully kept by the ancient Hebrews (compare those of Genesis, Numbers, Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Matthew, Luke), not only because they formed the basis of a man&#x27;s title to his property (Nu 27:8-11; exceptional case, Nu 36:1-12), but also because on one&#x27;s pedigree depended the right of his family to intermarry with the priestly caste. Descent was traced through the father; a man&#x27;s closest association was therefore with his father&#x27;s family, and he was ordinarily referred to as the son of his father, thus Isaac the son of Abraham (Ge 25:19), Joshua the son of Nun, Caleb the son of Jephunneh (Nu 14:6). Still there are instances of men named for their mothers (Joab the son of Zeruiah), and a man&#x27;s relation with his mother&#x27;s family was fully recognized in the laws forbidding incest. No lineal relatives were permitted to intermarry (Le 18:7,10). The relations of ancestors and descendants were considered so close that the ordinary terms of relationship between children and parents are used constantly in relation to grandparents and remoter ancestors. The wishes of a great-grandfather are respected long after his death as the wishes of a father (Jer 35:16).2. Parents and Children:The father (&#x27;abh; pater) was the head of the family (mishpachah) or household (bayith), which was a religious (1Sa 20:6,29; Ex 12:3; Job 1:5) as well as a ...</p>

It is probably identical with Ramoth of 1Ch 6:73, and Jarmuth of Jos 21:29. It is represented today by the village er-Rameh, situated on a hill which rises abruptly from the green plain about 11 miles Southwest of Jenin (Engannim). While the southern boundary of Issachar was, roughly, the southern edge of the plain of Esdraelon, the possessions of the tribes seem sometimes to have overlapped.See JARMUTH; RAMOTH.</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">re-mish&#x27;-un (aphesis, paresis): The two Greek words, of which the latter occurs only in Ro 3:25, were translated by the same English word in the King James Version. In the Revised Version (British and American), paresis is translation &quot;passing over.&quot; It is contrasted with the other term as pretermission with remission. Remission is exemption from the consequences of an offense, forgiveness; pretermission is the suspension of the penalty (Philippi, Ellicott, Trench (Synonyms, XXXIII), Weiss; compare Ac 17:30). Cremer (Lexicon of N T Gr) regards the meaning of the two words as identical, except that the one refers to the Old Testament and the other to the New Testament. Sins are remitted when the offender is treated as though the offense had never been committed. Remission is restricted to the penalty, while forgiveness refers more particularly to the person, although it may be used also of the sin itself. Remission also is used of offenses against God&#x27;s law; forgiveness, against either divine or human law.See ABSOLUTION; FORGIVENESS.H. E. Jacobs</p>

As the translation of the last-mentioned two words, &quot;remnant&quot; has a special significance in the prophecies of Isaiah, as denoting &quot;a holy seed,&quot; or spiritual kernel, of the nation which should survive impending judgment and become the germ of the people of God, being blessed of God and made a blessing (compare Mic 2:12; 4:7; 5:7,8; 7:18; also Ze 2:7; 3:13; Hag 1:12,14; Zec 8:6; Joe 2:32).

The Volitional ElementLITERATURETo get an accurate idea of the precise New Testament meaning of this highly important word it is necessary to consider its approximate synonyms in the original Hebrew and Greek The psychological elements of repentance should be considered in the light of the general teaching of Scripture.I. Old Testament Terms.1. To Repent--&quot;to Pant,&quot; &quot;to Sigh&quot;:The Hebrew word naham, is an onomatopoetic term which implies difficulty in breathing, hence, &quot;to pant,&quot; &quot;to sigh,&quot; &quot;to groan.&quot; Naturally it came to signify &quot;to lament&quot; or &quot;to grieve,&quot; and when the emotion was produced by the desire of good for others, it merged into compassion and sympathy, and when incited by a consideration of one&#x27;s own character and deeds it means &quot;to rue,&quot; &quot;to repent.&quot; To adapt language to our understanding, God is represented as repenting when delayed penalties are at last to be inflicted, or when threatened evils have been averted by genuine reformation (Ge 6:6; Jon 3:10). This word is translated &quot;repent&quot; about 40 times in the Old Testament, and in nearly all cases it refers to God. The principal idea is not personal relation to sin, either in its experience of grief or in turning from an evil course. Yet the results of sin are manifest in its use. God&#x27;s heart is grieved at man&#x27;s iniquity, and in love He bestows His grace, or in justice He terminates His mercy. It indicates the aroused emotions of God which prompt Him to a different course of dealing with the people. Similarly when used with reference to man, only in this case the consciousness of personal transgression is evident. This distinction in the application of the word is intended by such declarations as God &quot;is not a man, that he should repent&quot; (1Sa 15:29; Job 42:6; Jer 8:6).2. To Repent--&quot;to Turn&quot; or &quot;Return&quot;:The term shubh, is most generally employed to express the Scriptural idea of genuine repentance. It is used extensively by the prophets, and makes prominent the idea of a radical change in one&#x27;s attitude toward sin and God. It implies a conscious, moral separation, and a personal decision to forsake sin and to enter into fellowship with God. It is employed extensively with reference to man&#x27;s turning away from sin to righteousness (De 4:30; Ne 1:9; Ps 7:12; Jer 3:14). It quite often refers to God in His relation to man (Ex 32:12; Jos 7:26). It is employed to indicate the thorough spiritual change which God alone can effect (Ps 85:4). When the term is translated by &quot;return&quot; it has reference either to man, to God, or to God and man (1Sa 7:3; Ps 90:13 (both terms, nacham and shubh; Isa 21:12; 55:7). Both terms are also sometimes employed when the twofold idea...</p>

The host expected to find water here; to their distress the streams were dry, and water was miraculously provided. Palmer (Desert of the Exodus, 158 ff) states cogent reasons for identifying Rephidim with Wady Feiran. It is the most fertile part of the peninsula, well watered, with a palm grove stretching for miles along the valley. Palmer speaks of passing through the palm grove as a &quot;most delightful&quot; walk; &quot;the tall, graceful trees afforded a delicious shade, fresh water ran at our feet, and, above all, bulbuls flitted from branch to branch uttering their sweet notes.&quot; His camp was pitched at &quot;the mouth of Wady `Aleyat, a large open space completely surrounded by steep, shelving mountains of gneiss, the fantastic cleavage of which added greatly to the beauty of the scene. Palms and tamarisks were dotted all around, and on every knoll and mountain slope were ruined houses, churches, and walls, the relics of the ancient monastic city of Paran. Behind our tents rose the majestic mass of Serbal, and beneath the rocky wall opposite ran a purling brook, only a few inches in depth, but still sufficiently cool, clear, and refreshing.&quot;Such a place as this the Amalekites would naturally wish to preserve for themselves against an invading people. For these desert dwellers, indeed, the possession of this watered vale may well have been a matter of life and death.If this identification is correct, then Jebel Tachuneh, &quot;Mount of the mill,&quot; a height that rises on the North of the valley, may have been the hill from which Moses, with Aaron and Hur, viewed the battle.W.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">The close phonetic resemblance and etymological affinity of dokimos to the verb dokimazo, &quot;to try,&quot; &quot;test,&quot; has caused the notion of &quot;being tested,&quot; &quot;tried,&quot; and its opposite of &quot;being found wanting in the test&quot; to associate itself more or less distinctly with the adjectives dokimos and adokimos. Thus the more complex meaning results of that which is acknowledged or rejected, because it has approved or not approved itself in testing. This connotation is present in 2Co 13:5,6,7; 2Ti 3:8; Tit 1:16; Heb 6:8. In the first two of these passages the word is used of Christians who ostensibly were in the true faith, but either hypothetically or actually are represented as having failed to meet the test. &quot;Reprobate unto every good work&quot; (Tit 1:16) are they who by their life have disappointed the expectation of good works. The &quot;reprobate (rejected) land&quot; of Heb 6:8 is land that by bearing thorns and thistles has failed to meet the test of the husband man. It should be noticed, however, that adokimos, even in these cases, always retains the meaning of rejection because of failure in trial; compare in the last-named passage: &quot;rejected and nigh unto cursing.&quot;LITERATURE.Cremer, Biblisch-theologisches Worterbuch der neutestamentlichen Gracitat(10), 356-57.Geerhardus Vos</p>

Hence, a fairly easy rendition into English was possible, but the result included all the ambiguities of the original, and to modern readers such a passage as &quot;But your reproof, what doth it reprove? Do ye think to reprove words&quot; (Job 6:25,26 the American Standard Revised Version) is virtually incomprehensible. The meaning is, approximately: &quot;What do your rebukes prove? Are you quibbling about words?&quot; In Joh 16:8 no single word in modern English will translate elegcho, and &quot;reprove&quot; (the King James Version), &quot;convince&quot; (King James Version margin), and &quot;convict&quot; (Revised Version) are all unsatisfactory. The sense is: &quot;The Spirit will teach men the true meaning of these three words: sin, righteousness, judgment.&quot;Burton Scott Easton</p>

The Name and Its Native Equivalent:The Greek forms show that the Septuagint translators had &quot;d&quot;, for &quot;r&quot;, but the reading of the Massoretic Text is to be preferred. Resen--the last of the four cities mentioned in Ge 10:11,12 as having been founded by Nimrod (the King James Version by Asshur)--probably represents the Assyrian pronunciation of the place-name Res-eni, &quot;fountainhead.&quot; The only town so named in the inscriptions is one of 18 mentioned by Sennacherib in the Bavian inscription as places from which he dug canals connecting with the river Khosr--in fact, it was one of the sources of Nineveh&#x27;s water supply. It probably lay too far North, however, to be the city here intended. Naturally the name &quot;Resen&quot; could exist in any place where there was a spring.2. Possibly the Modern Selamiyeh:As the Biblical text requires a site lying between Nineveh and Calah (Kouyunjik and Nimroud), it is generally thought to be represented by the ruins at Selamiyeh, about 3 miles North of the latter city. It is noteworthy that Xenophon (Anab. iii.4) mentions a &quot;great&quot; city called Larissa as occupying this position, and Bochart has suggested that it is the same place. He supposes that when the inhabitants were asked to what city the ruins belonged, they answered la Resen, &quot;to Resen,&quot; which was reproduced by the Greeks as Larissa. Xenophon describes its walls as being 25 ft. wide, 100 ft. high, and 2 parasangs in circuit. Except for the stone plinth 20 ft. high, they were of brick. He speaks of a stone-built pyramid near the city--possibly the temple-tower at Nimroud.See CALAH; NINEVEH, 10.T. G. Pinches</p>

As applied to a (prostrate) suppliant, the phrase means &quot;receive him with favor,&quot; and is so used in 1Sa 25:35; Mal 1:8,9 (compare Ge 19:21, etc.). By a shift in force the phrase came to mean &quot;accept the person instead of the cause&quot; or &quot;show partiality&quot; (Job 13:8,10 the American Standard Revised Version), and is so used commonly. A literal translation into Greek gave lambano prosopon (Sirach 35:13 (32:16); Lu 20:21; Ga 2:6), with the noun prosopolempsia, &quot;face-taking&quot; (Ro 2:11; Eph 6:9; Col 3:25; Jas 2:1), rendered uniformly &quot;respect of persons&quot; in English Versions of the Bible.

It is applied to God as ceasing from the work of creating on the 7th day (Ge 2:2 f) ; as having His place of rest in the midst of His people in the temple (1Ch 28:2; Ps 132:8,14); as resting in His love among His people (Ze 3:17, the Revised Version margin &quot;Hebrew, `be silent&#x27; &quot;). The 7th day was to be one of rest (Ex 16:23; 31:15; see SABBATH); the land also was to have its rest in the 7th year (Le 25:4 f). Yahweh promised His people rest in the land He should give them; this they looked forward to and enjoyed (De 12:9; Jos 11:23). &quot;To rest on&quot; often means to come upon to abide, as of the Spirit of Yahweh (Nu 11:25 f; Isa 11:2), of wisdom (Pr 14:33), of anger (Ec 7:9). There is again the &quot;rest&quot; of the grave (Job 3:13,17,18; Isa 57:2; Da 12:13). Rest is sometimes equivalent to trust, reliance (2Ch 14:11, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;rely&quot;). Hence, rest in Yahweh (Ps 37:7, etc.); &quot;rest&quot; in the spiritual sense is not, however, prominent in the Old Testament. In the New Testament Christ&#x27;s great offer is rest to the soul (Mt 11:28). In Heb 4:1 ff, it is argued from God&#x27;s having promised His people a &quot;rest&quot;--a promise not realized in Canaan (4:8)--that there remains for the people of God &quot;a Sabbath rest&quot; (sabbatismos, 4:9). For &quot;rest&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) has &quot;solemn rest&quot; (Ex 16:23; 31:15, etc.), &quot;resting-place&quot; (Ps 132:8,14; Isa 11:10), &quot;peace&quot; (Ac 9:31), &quot;relief&quot; (2Co 2:13; 7:5), etc.See also REMNANT.W.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">res-to-ra&#x27;-shun: The idea of a restoration of the world had its origin in the preaching of the Old Testament prophets. Their faith in the unique position and mission of Israel as the chosen people of God inspired in them the conviction that the destruction of the nation would eventually be followed by a restoration under conditions that would insure the realization of the original divine purpose. When the restoration came and passed without fulfillment of this hope, the Messianic era was projected into the future. By the time of Jesus the conception became more or less spiritualized, and the anticipation of a new order in which the consequences of sin would no longer appear was a prominent feature of the Messianic conception. In the teaching of Jesus and the apostles such a restoration is taken for granted as a matter of course.In Mt 17:11 (compare Mr 9:12), the moral and spiritual regeneration preached by John the Baptist is described as a restoration and viewed as a fulfillment of Mal 4:6. It is &quot;to be observed, however, that the work of John could be characterized as restoration only in the sense of an inception of the regeneration that was to be completed by Jesus. In Mt 19:28 Jesus speaks of a regeneration (palingenesia) of the world in terms that ascribe to the saints a state of special felicity. Perhaps the most pointed expression of the idea of restoration as a special event or crisis is found in the address of Peter (Ac 3:21), where the restoration is described as an apokatastasis panton, and is viewed as a fulfillment of prophecy.In all the passages cited the restoration is assumed as a matter with which the hearers are familiar, and consequently its nature is not unfolded. The evidence is, therefore, too limited to justify any attempt to outline its special features. Under such circumstances there is grave danger of reading into the language of the Scriptures one&#x27;s own conception of what the restoration is to embody. We are probably expressing the full warrant of the Scripture when we say that the reconstruction mentioned in these passages contemplates the restoration of man, under the reign of Christ, to a life in which the consequences of sin are no longer present, and that this reconstruction is to include in some measure a regeneration of both the physical and the spiritual world.Whether the benefits of the restoration are to accrue to all men is also left undefined in the Scriptures. In the passages already cited only the disciples of Christ appear in the field of vision. Certain sayings of Jesus are sometimes regarded as favorable to the more inclusive view. In Joh 12:32 Jesus speaks of drawing all men to Himself, but here, as in Joh 3:14,15, it is to be observed that while Christ&#x27;s sacrifice includes all men in its scope, its benefits will doubtless accrue to those only who respond willingly to His drawing power. The saying of Caiaphas (Joh 11:52) is irrelevant, for the phrase, &quot;the children of God that are scattered abroad,&quot; pr...</p>

Nationalism:It is very remarkable that a doctrine of life after death as an essential part of religion was of very late development in Israel, although this doctrine, often highly elaborated, was commonly held among the surrounding nations. The chief cause of this lateness was that Israel&#x27;s religion centered predominantly in the ideal of a holy nation. Consequently the individual was a secondary object of consideration, and the future of the man who died before the national promises were fulfilled either was merged in the future of his descendants or else was disregarded altogether.2. Speculation:Much speculation about life after death evidently existed, but it was not in direct connection with the nation&#x27;s religion. Therefore, the Old Testament data are scanty and point, as might be expected, to non-homogeneous concepts. Still, certain ideas are clear. The living individual was composed of &quot;flesh&quot; and nephesh, or ruach (a trichotomy appears to be post-Biblical, despite 1Th 5:23; see PSYCHOLOGY). In the individual nephesh and ruach seem to be fairly synonymous words, meaning primarily &quot;breath,&quot; as the animating principle of the flesh (so for the lower animals in Ps 104:29,30). But nephesh came to be used to denote the &quot;inner man&quot; or &quot;self&quot; (De 12:20, etc.; see HEART), and so in English Versions of the Bible is usually rendered &quot;soul.&quot; But there are only a very few cases where nephesh is used for the seat of the personality after death (Ps 30:3; compare Ps 16:10; 38:17; Job 33:18, etc.), and nearly all of such passages seem quite late. Indeed, in some 13 cases the nephesh of a dead man is unmistakably his corpse (Le 19:28; Nu 5:2; Hag 2:13, etc.). It seems the question of what survives death was hardly raised; whatever existed then was thought of as something quite new. On the one hand the dead man could be called a &quot;god&quot; (1Sa 28:13), a term perhaps related to ancestor-worship. But more commonly the dead are thought of as &quot;shades,&quot; repha&#x27;im (Job 26:5 margin, etc.), weak copies of the original man in all regards (Eze 32:25). But, whatever existence such &quot;shades&quot; might have, they had passed out of relation to Yahweh, whom the &quot;dead praise not&quot; (Ps 115:17,18; Isa 38:18,19), and there was no religious interest in them.3.

Third Proof: Transformation of the Disciples4. Fourth Proof: Existence of the Primitive Church5. Fifth Proof: The Witness of Paul6. Sixth Proof: The Gospel Record7. Summary and ConClusion8. Theology of the ResurrectionLITERATUREThe Resurrection has always been felt to be vital in connection with Christianity. As a consequence, opponents have almost always concentrated their attacks, and Christians have centered their defense, upon it. It is therefore of the utmost importance to give attention to the subject, as it appears in the New Testament. There are several converging lines of evidence, and none can be overlooked. Each must have its place and weight. The issues at stake are so serious that nothing must be omitted.1. First Proof: The Life of Jesus:The first proof is the life of Jesus Christ Himself. It is always a disappointment when a life which commenced well finishes badly. We have this feeling even in fiction; instinct demands that a story should end well. Much more is this true of Jesus Christ. A perfect life characterized by divine claims ends in its prime in a cruel and shameful death. Is that a fitting close? Surely death could not end everything after such a noble career. The Gospels give the resurrection as the completion of the picture of Jesus Christ. There is no real doubt that Christ anticipated His own resurrection. At first He used only vague terms, such as, &quot;Destroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&quot; But later on He spoke plainly, and whenever He mentioned His death, He added, &quot;The Son of man .... must be raised the third day.&quot; These references are too numerous to be overlooked, and, in spite of difficulties of detail, they are, in any proper treatment of the Gospels, an integral part of the claim made for Himself by Jesus Christ (Mt 12:38-40; 16:21; 17:9,23; 20:19; 27:63; Mr 8:31; 9:9,31; 10:34; 14:58; Lu 9:22; 18:33; Joh 2:19-21). His veracity is at stake if He did not rise. Surely the word of such a One must be given due credence. We are therefore compelled to face the fact that the resurrection of which the Gospels speak is the resurrection of no ordinary man, but of Jesus--that is of One whose life and character had been unique, and for whose shameful death no proper explanation was conceivable (Denhey, Jesus and the Gospel, 122 f). Is it possible that, in view of His perfect truthfulness of word and deed, there should be such an anti-climax as is involved in a denial of His assurance that He would rise again (C.H. Robinson, Studies in the Resurrection, 30)? Consider, too, the death of Christ in the light of His perfect life. If that death was the close of a life so beautiful, so remarkable, so Godlike, we are faced with an insoluble mystery--the permanent triumph of wrong over right, and the impossibility of believing in truth or justice in the world (C.H.

As the absolution is properly an assurance of individual forgiveness, so the retention is an assurance of individual non-forgiveness. That the retention is exercised by the ministry, not as an order, but as the representatives of the congregation of believers to which Christ gave the power of the keys, is shown by Alford, Greek Testament, on above passage.

Moral Sense Demands Vindication of God&#x27;s Righteousness11. Scripture Indicates Certainty of VindicationLITERATURE1. New Testament Terms:The word as applied to the divine administration is not used in Scripture, but undoubtedly the idea is commonly enough expressed. The words which come nearest to it are orge, and thumos wrath attributed to God; ekdikeo, ekdikesis, ekdikos, and dike, all giving the idea of vengeance; kolasis, and timoria, &quot;punishment&quot;; besides krino, and its derivatives, words expressive of judgment.2. A Revelation of Wrath as Well as Grace:Romans 2 is full of the thought of retribution. The apostle, in 2:5,6, comes very near to using the word itself, and gives indeed a good description of the thing: the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, &quot;who will render to every man according to his works.&quot; It is well in approaching the subject to remind ourselves that there is undoubtedly, as the apostle says, a Revelation of wrath. We are so accustomed to think of the gracious revelation which the gospel brings us, and to approach the subject of the doom of the impenitent under the influence of the kindly sentiments engendered thereby, and with a view of God&#x27;s gracious character as revealed in salvation, that we are apt to overlook somewhat the sterner facts of sin, and to misconceive the divine attitude toward the impenitent sinner. It is certainly well that we should let the grace of the gospel have full influence upon all our thinking, but we must beware of being too fully engrossed with one phase of the divine character. It is an infirmity of human nature that we find it difficult to let two seemingly conflicting conceptions find a place in our thought. We are apt to surrender ourselves to the sway of one or the other of them according to the pressure of the moment.3. Witness of Natural Theology:Putting ourselves back into the position of those who have only the light of natural theology, we find that all deductions from the perfections of God, as revealed in His works, combined with a consideration of man&#x27;s sin and want of harmony with the Holy One, lead to the conclusion announced by the apostle: &quot;The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men&quot; (Ro 1:18). Wrath implies punishment, punishment is decreed, punishment is denounced. The word of God but confirms the verdict which conscience forecasts. Nature teaches that punishment, retribution, must follow sin. Within the sphere of physical law this is clearly exemplified. No breach of the so-called laws of Nature is tolerated.

Jacob&#x27;s Oldest Son:This verse seems to suggest two derivations of the name. As it stands in Massoretic Text it means &quot;behold a son&quot;; but the reason given for so calling him is &quot;The Lord hath looked upon my affliction,&quot; which in Hebrew is ra&#x27;ah be`onyi, literally, &quot;He hath seen my affliction.&quot; Of his boyhood we have only the story of the mandrakes (Ge 30:14). As the firstborn he should really have been leader among his father&#x27;s sons. His birthright was forfeited by a deed of peculiar infamy (Ge 35:22), and as far as we know his tribe never took the lead in Israel. It is named first, indeed, in Nu 1:5,20, but thereafter it falls to the fourth place, Judah taking the first (Nu 2:10, etc.). To Reuben&#x27;s intervention Joseph owed his escape from the fate proposed by his other brethren (Ge 37:29). Some have thought Reuben designed to set him free, from a desire to rehabilitate himself with his father. But there is no need to deny to Reuben certain noble and chivalrous qualities. Jacob seems to have appreciated these, and, perhaps, therefore all the more deeply lamented the lapse that spoiled his life (Ge 49:3 f). It was Reuben who felt that their perils and anxieties in Egypt were a fit recompense for the unbrotherly conduct (Ge 42:22). To assure his father of Benjamin&#x27;s safe return from Egypt, whither Joseph required him to be taken, Reuben was ready to pledge his own two sons (Ge 42:37). Four sons born to him in Canaan went down with Reuben at the descent of Israel into Egypt (Ge 46:8 f).The incidents recorded are regarded by a certain school of Old Testament scholars as the vague and fragmentary traditions of the tribe, wrought into the form of a biography of the supposed ancestor of the tribe. This interpretation raises more difficulties than it solves, and depends for coherence upon too many assumptions and conjectures. The narrative as it stands is quite intelligible and self-consistent. There is no good reason to doubt that, as far as it goes, it is an authentic record of the life of Jacob&#x27;s son.2. Tribal History:At the first census in the wilderness Reuben numbered 46,500 men of war (Nu 1:21); at the second they had fallen to 43,730; see NUMBERS. The standard of the camp of Reuben was on the south side of the tabernacle; and with him were Simeon and Gad; the total number of fighting men in this division being 151,450. Targum Pseudo-Jonathan says that the standard was a deer, with the legend &quot;Hear O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord.&quot; On the march this division took the second place (Nu 2:10). The prince of the tribe was Elizur ben Shedeur, whose oblation is described in Nu 7:30 ff. The Reubenite among the spies was Shammua ben Zaccur (13:4). It is possible that the conspiracy against Moses, organized by the Reubenites Dathan and Abiram, with the assistance of Korah the Levite (Nu 16), was an attempt on the part of the tribe to asser...</p>

In the account of the marriage of Zipporah to Moses (Ex 2:16-21) Jethro seems to be called Reuel (compare HOBAB). The various names of Jethro perplexed the Talmudists, too; some held that his real name was &quot;Hobab,&quot; and that Reuel was his father. Reuel is probably a clan name (Gray, &quot;Nu,&quot; ICC), and Hobab is a member of the clan (&quot;son&quot;) of Reuel (Nu 10:29, the King James Version reads &quot;Raguel&quot;).(2) The father of Eliasaph, the prince of Gad (Nu 2:14), called (by some copyist&#x27;s mistake) &quot;Deuel&quot; in Nu 1:14; 7:42,47; 10:20.

The Ordinary Forms2. &quot;Word of Yahweh&quot; and &quot;Torah&quot;3. &quot;The Scriptures&quot;LITERATUREI. The Nature of Revelation.1. The Religion of the Bible the Only Supernatural Religion:The religion of the Bible is a frankly supernatural religion. By this is not meant merely that, according to it, all men, as creatures, live, move and have their being in God. It is meant that, according to it, God has intervened extraordinarily, in the course of the sinful world&#x27;s development, for the salvation of men otherwise lost. In Eden the Lord God had been present with sinless man in such a sense as to form a distinct element in his social environment (Ge 3:8). This intimate association was broken up by the Fall. But God did not therefore withdraw Himself from concernment with men. Rather, He began at once a series of interventions in human history by means of which man might be rescued from his sin and, despite it, brought to the end destined for him. These interventions involved the segregation of a people for Himself, by whom God should be known, and whose distinction should be that God should be &quot;nigh unto them&quot; as He was not to other nations (De 4:7; Ps 145:18). But this people was not permitted to imagine that it owed its segregation to anything in itself fitted to attract or determine the Divine preference; no consciousness was more poignant in Israel than that Yahweh had chosen it, not it Him, and that Yahweh&#x27;s choice of it rested solely on His gracious will. Nor was this people permitted to imagine that it was for its own sake alone that it had been singled out to be the sole recipient of the knowledge of Yahweh; it was made clear from the beginning that God&#x27;s mysteriously gracious dealing with it had as its ultimate end the blessing of the whole world (Ge 12:2,3; 17:4,5,6,16; 18:18; 22:18; compare Ro 4:13), the bringing together again of the divided families of the earth under the glorious reign of Yahweh, and the reversal of the curse under which the whole world lay for its sin (Ge 12:3). Meanwhile, however, Yahweh was known only in Israel. To Israel God showed His word and made known His statutes and judgments, and after this fashion He dealt with no other nation; and therefore none other knew His judgments (Ps 147:19 f). Accordingly, when the hope of Israel (who was also the desire of all nations) came, His own lips unhesitatingly declared that the salvation He brought, though of uni...</p>

It professes to be the record of prophetic visions given by Jesus Christ to John, while the latter was a prisoner, &quot;for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus&quot; (Re 1:9), in PATMOS (which see), a small rocky island in the Aegean, about 15 miles West of Ephesus. Its precursor in the Old Testament is the Book of Dnl, with the symbolic visions and mystical numbers of which it stands in close affinity. The peculiar form of the book, its relation to other &quot;apocalyptic&quot; writings, and to the Fourth Gospel, likewise attributed to John, the interpretation of its symbols, with disputed questions of its date, of worship, unity, relations to contemporary history, etc., have made it one of the most difficult books in the New Testament to explain satisfactorily.I. Title and General Character of Book.1. Title:&quot;Revelation&quot; answers to apokalupsis, in Re 1:1. The oldest form of the title would seem to be simply, &quot;Apocalypse of John,&quot; the appended words &quot;the divine&quot; (theologos, i.e. &quot;theologian&quot;) not being older than the 4th century (compare the title given to Gregory of Nazianzus, &quot;Gregory theologian&quot;). The book belongs to the class of works commonly named &quot;apocalyptic,&quot; as containing visions and revelations of the future, frequently in symbolical form (e.g. the Book of Enoch, the Apocalypse of Bar, the Apocalypse of Ezr; see APOCALYPTIC LITERATURE), but it is doubtful if the word here bears this technical sense. The tendency at present is to group the New Testament Apocalypse with these others, and attribute to it the same kind of origin as theirs, namely, in the unbridled play of religious fantasy, clothing itself in unreal visional form.2. Uniqueness and Reality of Visions:But there is a wide distinction. These other works are pseudonymous--fictitious; on the face of them products of imagination; betraying that this is their origin in their crude, confused, unedifying character. The Apocalypse bears on it the name of its author--an apostle of Jesus Christ (see below); claims to rest on real visions; rings with the accent of sincerity; is orderly, serious, sublime, purposeful, in its conceptions; deals with the most solemn and momentous of themes. On the modern Nerotheory, to which most recent expositors give adherence, it is a farrago of baseless fantasies, no one of which came true. On its own claim it is a product of true prophecy (Re 1:3; 22:18 f), and has or will ...</p>

In English these words are synonymous in that they are both used to express the infliction of punishment upon the wrongdoer, but &quot;to take revenge&quot; may also imply a spiteful, wrong or malignant spirit. In the latter case, the Revised Version (British and American) preserves &quot;revenge&quot; (compare Jer 20:10; Eze 25:15; 25:17 is an anthropomorphism), but, wherever it is synonymous with &quot;avenge,&quot; this word is used (compare Nu 31:2,3; Ps 79:10; Na 1:2;  /RAPC Jdt 13:20; Ro 13:4; 2Co 7:11; 10:6 the Revised Version (British and American); the King James Version has &quot;revenge&quot; in all these cases).

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">rev&#x27;-er-ens: In the Old Testament, &quot;reverence&quot; occurs as the translation of two Hebrew words, yare&#x27; and shachah. The root idea of the former is &quot;fear.&quot; It is used to express the attitude toward God Himself, as in Ps 89:7 the King James Version; or toward His sanctuary, as in Le 19:30; 26:2. So the group of ideas there would be &quot;fear,&quot; &quot;awe,&quot; &quot;reverence.&quot; The root idea of the second is &quot;falling down,&quot; as prostration of the body. It is used to express the bearing toward another who is considered superior, as in 2Sa 9:6 the King James Version; 1Ki 1:31 the King James Version; Es 3:2,5. The group of ideas here, therefore, is &quot;honor,&quot; &quot;obeisance,&quot; &quot;reverence.&quot;In the New Testament &quot;reverence&quot; occurs as the translation of three Greek words, aidos, phobeomai, and entrepomai.

In English Versions of the Bible, however, &quot;reward&quot; is used quite generally for anything given, and the term covers the recompense of evil (Ps 91:8), wages (1Ti 5:18 the King James Version), bribes (Mic 7:3), and gifts (Jer 40:5 the King James Version). The Revised Version (British and American) has specialized the meaning in a number of cases (Ps 94:2; Eze 16:34; Jer 40:5, etc.), but not systematically.</p>

Alona with Pekah, the son of Remaliah, who reigned 20 years over Israel in Samaria, he joined in the Syro-Ephraimitic war aaainst Ahaz, the king of Judah. Together they laid siege to Jerusalem, but were unsuccessful in the effort to take it (2Ki 16:5; Isa 7:1). It was to calm the fears, and to restore the fainting spirits of the men of Judah, that Isaiah was commissioned by the Lord to assure them that the schemes of &quot;these two tails of smoking firebrands&quot; (Isa 7:4) were destined to miscarry. It was then, too, that the sign was aiven of the vigin who should conceive, and bear a son, and should call his name Immanuel. Rezin had to content himself on this campaign to the South with the capture of Elath from the men of Judah and its restoration to the men of Edom, from whom it had been taken and made a seaport by Solomon (2Ki 16:6, where it is agareed that &quot;Syria&quot; and &quot;Syrians&quot; should be read &quot;Edom&quot; and &quot;Edomites,&quot; which in the Hebrew script are easy to be mistaken for one another, and are in fact often mistaken). Rezin, however, had a more formidable enemy to encounter on his return to Damascus. Ahaz, like kings of Judah before and after him, placed his reliance more on the arm of flesh than on the true King of his people, and appealed to Tiglath-pileser III, of Assyria, for help. Ahaz deliberately sacrificed the independence of his country in the terms of his offer of submission to the Assyrian: &quot;I am thy servant and thy son&quot; (2Ki 16:7). Tiglath-pileser had already carried his arms to the West and ravaged the northern border of Israel; and now he crossed the Euphrates and hastened to Damascus, slaying Rezin and carrying his people captive to Kir (2Ki 16:9). In the copious Annals of Tialath-pileser, Rezin figures with the designation Racunu(ni), but the tablet recording his death, found and read by Sir Henry Rawlinson, has been irrecoverably lost, and only the fact of its existence and loss remains (Schrader, COT, I, 252, 257). With the death of Rezin the kingdom of Damascus and Syria came to an end.Rezin, Sons of: Mentioned among the Nethinim (Ezr 2:48), who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel from captivity (compare Ne 7:50).LITERATURE.Schrader, COT, as above; Driver, Authority, 99 ff,T.

When David conquered Zobah, Rezon renounced his allegiance to Hadadezer and became powerful as an independent chief, capturing Damascus and setting up as king. Along with Hadad, the noted Edomite patriot, he became a thorn in the side of Solomon, the one making himself obnoxious in the South, the other in the North, of the kingdom of Israel, both being animated with a bitter hatred of the common foe. It is said of Rezon that he &quot;reigned over Syria&quot; (1Ki 11:25), and if the surmise adopted by many scholars is correct that he is the same as Hezion (1Ki 15:18), then he was really the founder of the dynasty of Syrian kings so well known in the history of this period of Israel; and the line would run: Rezon, Tabrimmon, Ben-hadad I, and Ben-hadad II.LITERATURE.Burney on 1Ki 11:23 and 15:18 in Notes on Hebrew Text of Books of Kings; Winckler, Alttest.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">re-ji-um: This city (@Rhegion] (Ac 28:13), the modern Reggio di Calabria) was a town situated on the east side of the Sicilian Straits, about 6 miles South of a point opposite Messana (Messina). Originally a colony of Chalcidian Greeks, the place enjoyed great prosperity in the 5th century BC, but was captured and destroyed by Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse, in 387 BC, when all the surviving inhabitants were sold into slavery (Diodorus xiv. 106-8, 111, 112). The city never entirely recovered from this blow, althouah it was partially restored by the younaer Dionysius. On the occasion of the invasion of Italy by Pyrrhus, the people of Rhegium had recourse to an alliance with Rome (280 BC) and received 4,000 Campanian troops within their walls, who turned out to be very unruly guests. For, in imitation of a similar band of mercenaries across the strait in Messana, they massacred the male inhabitants and reduced the women to slavery (Polybius i.7; Orosius iv.3). They were not punished by the Romans until 270 BC, when the town was restored to those of its former inhabitants who still survived. The people of Rhegium were faithful to their alliance with Rome during the Second Punic War (Livy xxiii.30; xxiv. 1; xxvi.12; xxix.6). At the time of the Social War they were incorporated with the Roman state, Rhegium becoming a municipality (Cicero Verr. v.60; Pro Archia, 3).The ship in which Paul sailed from Melita to Puteoli encountered unfavorable winds after leaving Syracuse, and reached Rhegium by means of tacking. It waited at Rhegium a day for a south wind which bore it to Puteoli (Ac 28:13), about 180 miles distant, where it probably arrived in about 26 hours.George H. Allen</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">rodz (Rhodos): An island (and city) in the Aegean Sea, West of Caria, rough and rocky in parts, but well watered and productive, though at present not extensively cultivated. Almost one-third of the island is now covered with trees in spite of earlier deforestation. The highest mountains attain an altitude of nearly 4,000 ft. The older names were Ophiusa, Asteria, Trinacria, Corymbia. The capital in antiquity was Rhodes, at the northeastern extremity, a strongly fortitled city provided with a double harbor. Near the entrance of the harbor stood one of the seven wonders of the ancient world--a colossal bronze statue dedicated to Helios. Tiffs colossus, made by Chares about 290 BC, at a cost of 300 talents ($300,000 in 1915), towered to the height of 104 ft.In the popular mind--both before and after Shakespeare represented Caesar as bestriding the world like a colossus--this gigantic figure is conceived as an image of a human being of monstrous size with leas spread wide apart, at the entrance of the inner harbor, so huge that the largest ship with sails spread could move in under it; but the account on which this conception is based seems to have no foundation.The statue was destroyed in 223 BC by an earthquake. It was restored by the Romans. In 672 AD the Saracens sold the ruins to a Jew. The quantity of metal was so areat that it would fill the cars of a modern freight train (900 camel loads).The most ancient cities of Rhodes were Ialysus, Ochyroma, and Lindus. The oldest inhabitants were immigrants from Crete. Later came the Carians. But no real advance in civilization was made before the immigration of the Dorians under Tlepolemus, one of the Heraclidae, and (after the Trojan war) Aethaemanes. Lindus, Ialysus and Camirus formed with Cos, Cnidus and Halicarnassus the so-called Dorian Hexapolis (Six Cities), the center of which was the temple of the Triopian Apollo on the coast of Caria. Rhodes now founded many colonies--in Spain (Rhode), in Italy (Parthenope, Salapia, Sirus, Sybaris), in Sicily (Gela), in Asia Minor (Soli), in Cilicia (Gaaae), and in Lycia (Corydalla). The island attained no political greatness until the three chief cities formed a confederation and rounded the new capital (Rhodes) in 408 BC. In the beginning of the Peloponnesian war, Rhodes sided with the Athenians, but, after 19 years of loyalty to Athens, went over to the Spartans (412 BC). In 394, when Conon appeared with his fleet before the city, the island fell into the hands of the Athenians again. A garrison was stationed at Rhodes by Alexander the Great. After his death this garrison was driven out by the Rhodians. It is at this time that the really great period of the island&#x27;s history begins. The inhabitants bravely defended their capital against Demetrius Poliorcetes in 304 BC--the same Demetrius who two years before had won a naval victory and had coins stamped with a &quot;Victory&quot; that is the counterpart of the &quot;Winaed Victory&quot; which commands the unbounded admiration ...</p>

The Aramaic word is only found in Da 7:5.Twice the Revised Version (British and American) uses the word &quot;rib&quot; in a figurative sense of two beams or rafters built in to the ark of the covenant and the altar of incense, on which the golden rings were fastened, which served to carry ark and altar by means of staves (Ex 30:4; 37:27).A curious mistranslation has crept into the King James Version, which here follows Jewish commentators or etymologists, in four passages in 2 Samuel (2:23; 3:27; 4:6; 20:10), where the &quot;fifth rib&quot; is mentioned as the place of the body under which spears or swords are thrust, so as to cause lethal wounds. The Hebrew word chomesh, which indeed means &quot;fifth,&quot; is here a noun, derived from a root meaning &quot;to be staunch,&quot; &quot;stalwart,&quot; &quot;stout&quot; &quot;fleshy,&quot; &quot;obese&quot; (compare chamush, &quot;armed,&quot; &quot;equipped soldier&quot;; Arabic el khamis (el chamis), &quot;the army,&quot; which, however, Arabic lexicographers explain as meaning &quot;fivefold,&quot; namely, vanguard, right and left wing, center and rear guard). The word is to be translated &quot;abdomen,&quot; &quot;belly.&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) renders correctly &quot;into the body.&quot;H. L. E. Luering</p>

Here Pharaoh-necoh, after defeating Josiah at Megiddo and destroying Kadytis or Kadesh on the Orontes, fixed his headquarters, and while in camp he deposed Jehoahaz and cast him into chains, fixed the tribute of Judah, and appointed Jehoiakim king (2Ki 23:31-35). In 588 BC Nebuchadnezzar, at war with Egypt and the Syrian states, also established his headquarters at Riblah, and from it he directed the subjugation of Jerusalem. When it fell, Zedekiah was carried prisoner to Riblah, and there, after his sons and his nobles had been slain in his presence, his eyes were put out, and he was taken as a prisoner to Babylon (2Ki 25:6,20; Jer 39:5-7; 52:8-11). Riblah then disappears from history, but the site exists today in the village of Ribleh, 35 miles Northeast of Baalbek, and the situation is the finest that could have been chosen by the Egyptian or Babylonian kings for their headquarters in Syria. An army camped there had abundance of water in the control of the copious springs that go to form the Orontes. The Egyptians coming from the South had behind them the command of the rich corn and forage lands of Coele-Syria, while the Babylonian army from the North was equally fortunate in the rich plains extending to Hamath and the Euphrates. Lebanon, close by, with its forests, its hunting grounds and its snows, ministered to the needs and luxuries of the leaders. Riblah commanded the great trade and war route between Egypt and Mesopotamia, and, besides, it was at the dividing-point of many minor routes. It was in a position to attack with facility Phoenicia, Damascus or Palestine, or to defend itself against attack from those places, while a few miles to the South the mountains on each side close in forming a pass where a mighty host might easily be resisted by a few. In every way Riblah was the strategical point between North and South Syria. Riblah should probably be read for Diblah in Eze 6:14, while in Nu 34:11 it does not really appear. See (2).(2) A place named as on the ideal eastern boundary of Israel in Nu 34:11, but omitted in Eze 47:15-18. The Massoretic Text reads &quot;Hariblah&quot;; but the Septuagint probably preserves the true vocalization, according to which we should translate &quot;to Harbel.&quot; It is said to be to the east of `Ain, and that, as the designation of a district, can only mean Merj `Ayun, so that we should seek it in the neighborhood of Hermon, one of whose spurs Furrer found to be named Jebel `Arbel.W.

It looks at riches simply as riches, without regard to any particular feature. Alongside this would go the Greek ploutos (Mt 13:22; Eph 2:7).(2) Chocen (Pr 27:24; Jer 20:5), nekhacim and rekhush (Ge 36:7; Da 11:13,14 the King James Version) look at riches as things accumulated, collected, amassed.(3) Hon looks upon riches as earnings, the fruit of toil (Ps 119:14; Pr 8:18; Eze 27:27).(4) Hamon regards riches in the aspect of being much, this coming from the original idea of noise, through the idea of a multitude as making the noise, the idea of many, or much, being in multitude (Ps 37:16 the King James Version).(5) Chayil regards riches as power (Ps 62:1; Isa 8:4; 10:14).(6) Yithrah means &quot;running over,&quot; and so presents riches as abundance (Jer 48:36 the King James Version). Along with this may be placed shua`, which has the idea of breadth, and so of abundance (Job 36:19 the King James Version).(7) Qinyan regards riches as a creation, something made (Ps 104:24; compare margin);(8) (chrema) looks at riches as useful (Mr 10:23 f parallel). Like the New Testament, the Apoe uses only ploutos and chrema.Material riches are regarded by the Scriptures as neither good nor bad in themselves, but only according as they are properly or improperly used. They are transitory (Pr 27:24); they are not to be trusted in (Mr 10:23; Lu 18:24; 1Ti 6:17); they are not to be gloried in (Jer 9:23); the heart is not to be set on them (Ps 62:10); but they are made by God (Ps 104:24), and come from God (1Ch 29:12); and they are the crown of the wise (Pr 14:24). Material riches are used to body forth for us the most precious and glorious realities of the spiritual realm.

Of these the two noted are the most important: yashar, with the sense of being straight, direct, as &quot;right in the sight&quot; of Yahweh (Ex 15:26; De 12:25, etc.), in one&#x27;s own eyes (Jud 17:6), &quot;right words&quot; (Job 6:25 the King James Version, yosher), &quot;right paths&quot; (Pr 4:11 the King James Version); and mishpaT &quot;judgment&quot; &quot;cause&quot; etc., a forensic term, as &quot;Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?&quot; (Ge 18:25). In Job 34:17, the Revised Version (British and American) has &quot;justice&quot; (34:6, &quot;right&quot;), etc. The word tsedheq, tsedhaqah, ordinarily translated &quot;righteousness,&quot; are in a few cases rendered &quot;right&quot; (2Sa 19:28; Ne 2:20; Ps 9:4; 17:1; 119:75; Eze 18:5, etc.). In the New Testament the chief word is dikaios, primarily &quot;even,&quot; &quot;equal&quot; (Mt 20:4; Lu 12:57, etc.); more generally the word is rendered &quot;just&quot; and &quot;righteous.&quot; Euthus, used by Septuagint for yashar (1Sa 12:23; Ho 14:9), occurs a few times (Ac 8:21; 13:10; 2Pe 2:15); so orthos, &quot;straight,&quot; &quot;upright&quot; (Lu 10:28).  &quot;Right-hand&quot; or &quot;side&quot; represents Hebrew yamin and kindred forms (Ge 48:13,14,17; Ex 15:6, etc.); the Greek, in this sense, is dexios (Mt 6:3; 20:21, etc.).Revised Version, among other changes, has &quot;right&quot; for the King James Version &quot;judgment&quot; in Job 27:2; 34:5, and for &quot;right&quot; in the King James Version substitutes &quot;straight&quot; in Ezr 8:21, &quot;skillful&quot; in Ec 4:4, margin &quot;successful,&quot; etc. In Joh 1:12 the Revised Version (British and American) reads, &quot;the right to become children of God&quot; for the King James Version &quot;the power&quot; (exousia); in Mt 20:7,15 &quot;right&quot; is omitted, with the larger part of the verse. In 2Ti 2:15 &quot;rightly dividing&quot; (orthotomeo) is changed to &quot;handling aright&quot; with margin &quot;holding a straight course in the word of truth.

Double Aspect of Righteousness: Changing and Permanent2. Social Customs and Righteousness3. Changing Conception of Character of God: Obligations of Power4. Righteousness as Inner5. Righteousness as Social6. Righteousness as Expanding in Content with Growth in Ideals of Human WorthLITERATURE1. Double Aspect of Righteousness: Changing and Permanent:In Christian thought the idea of righteousness contains both a permanent and a changing element. The fixed element is the will to do right; the changing factor is the conception of what may be right at different times and under different circumstances. Throughout the entire course of Christian revelation we discern the emphasis on the first factor. To be sure, in the days of later Pharisaism righteousness came to be so much a matter of externals that the inner intent was often lost sight of altogether (Mt 23:23); but, on the whole and in the main, Christian thought in all ages has recognized as the central element in righteousness the intention to be and do right. This common spirit binds together the first worshippers of God and the latest. Present-day conceptions of what is right differ by vast distances from the conceptions of the earlier Hebrews, but the intentions of the first worshippers are as discernible as are those of the doers of righteousness in the present day.2. Social Customs and Righteousness:There seems but little reason to doubt that the content of the idea of righteousness was determined in the first instance by the customs of social groups. There are some, of course, who would have us believe that what we experience as inner moral sanction is nothing but the fear of consequences which come through disobeying the will of the social group, or the feeling of pleasure which results as we know we have acted in accordance with the social demands. At least some thinkers would have us believe that this is all there was in moral feeling in the beginning. If a social group was to survive it must lay upon its individual members the heaviest exactions. Back of the performance of religious rites was the fear of the group that the god of the group would be displeased if certain honors were not rendered to him. Merely to escape the penalties of an angry deity the group demanded ceremonial religious observances. From the basis of fear thus wrought into the individuals of the group have come all our loftier movements toward righteousness.It is not necessary to deny the measure of truth there may be in this account. To point out its inadequacy, however, a better statement would be that from the beginning the social group utilized the nativ...</p>

Robinson&#x27;s identification (RB, I, 440) has been very generally accepted. He found a conical and very prominent hill some 6 miles North-Northeast of Jeba` upon which stands a village called Rummon. This site was known to Eusebius and Jerome (OS 146 6; 287 98), who describe it as 15 Roman miles from Jerusalem. Another view, which would locate the place of refuge of the Benjamites in the Mugharet el jai, a large cavern on the south of the Wady Suweinit, near Jeba`, is strongly advocated by Rawnsley and Birch (see PEF, III, 137-48). The latter connects this again with 1Sa 14:2, where Saul, accompanied by his 600, &quot;abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah&quot; under the pomegranate tree (Rimmon).(2) (rimmon; Eremmon, or Rhemmoth): A city in the Negeb, near the border of Edom, ascribed to Judah (Jos 15:32) and to Simeon (Jos 19:7; 1Ch 4:32, the King James Version &quot;Remmon&quot;). In Zec 14:10 it is mentioned as the extreme South of Judah--&quot;from Geba to Rimmon, South of Jerusalem.&quot; In the earlier references Rimmon occurs in close association with `Ain (a spring), and in Ne 11:29, what is apparently the same place, `Ain Rimmon, is called En-rimmon (which see).(3) (rimmon (Jos 19:13), rimmonah, in some Hebrew manuscripts dimah (see DIMNAH) (Jos 21:35), and rimmono (1Ch 6:77)): In the King James Version we have &quot;Remmon-methoar&quot; in Jos 19:13, but the Revised Version (British and American) translates the latter as &quot;which stretcheth.&quot; This was a city on the border of Zebulun (Jos 19:13) allotted to the Levites (Jos 21:35, &quot;Dimnah&quot;; 1Ch 6:77). The site is now the little village of Rummaneh on a low ridge South of the western end of the marshy plain el Battauf in Galilee; there are many rock-cut tombs and cisterns. It is about 4 miles North of el Mesh-hed, usually considered to be the site of Gath-hepher. See PEF, I, 363, Sh VI.E. W. G. Masterman</p>

Elisha answers him ambiguously: &quot;Go in peace.&quot; Judging from Naaman&#x27;s position and this incident, Rimmon must have been one of the leading gods of the Syrians worshipped in Damascus. He has been identified with Rammanu, the Assyrian god of wind, rain and storm. The name appears in the Syrian personal names HADADRIMMON and TABRIMMON (which see) and its meaning is dubious (ramamu, &quot;to thunder&quot; (?))(2) A Benjamite of Beeroth, whose sons Baanah and Rechab assassinated Ish-bosheth (2Sa 4:2,5,9).Nathan Isaacs</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(Anglo-Saxon, Hring, &quot;ring&quot;): The word renders (the American Standard Revised Version) two Hebrew words (in the King James Version and the English Revised Version three) and two Greek words. Tabba`ath, the principal Hebrew word, is from Tabha`, &quot;sink,&quot; either because the ring is something &quot;cast&quot; or molded, or, more probably, since the principal use of the ring was as a seal, because it &quot;sank&quot; into the wax or clay that received the impression. In Exodus, Tabba`ath, &quot;ring,&quot; is a detail of furniture or equipment, as the rings of the ark through which the staves were thrust (Ex 25:12, etc.), rings for curtains, in the high priest&#x27;s ephod (Ex 28:28; 39:21), etc. Its other use was perhaps the original, to describe the article of personal adornment worn on the finger, apparently in the Old Testament always a signet-ring, and as such an indispensable article of masculine attire. Such a ring Pharaoh gave Joseph as a symbol of authority (Ge 41:42); and Ahasuerus gave Haman (Es 3:10); with it the royal missive was sealed (Es 3:12; 8:8 twice,10). It was also a feminine ornament in Isaiah&#x27;s list of the fashionable feminine paraphernalia, &quot;the rings and the nose-jewels&quot; (quite likely rings also) (Isa 3:21). Either as ornaments or for their intrinsic value, or both, rings were used as gifts for sacred purposes from both men and women: &quot;brooches, and ear-rings, and signet-rings&quot; (margin &quot;nose-rings&quot;) (Ex 35:22); &quot;bracelets, rings (the American Standard Revised Version &quot;signet-rings&quot;), ear-rings&quot; (Nu 31:50 the King James Version). chotham, &quot;signet,&quot; mentioned in Ge 38:18,25; Ex 28:11,21,36; Ex 39:6,14,30; Jer 22:24; Hag 2:23, etc., was probably usually a seal ring, but in Ge 38 and elsewhere the seal may have been swung on wire, and suspended by a cord from the neck. It was not only an identification, but served as a stamp for signature. galil, &quot;circle&quot; (compare &quot;Galilee,&quot; &quot;Circle&quot; of the Gentiles), rendered &quot;ring&quot; in Es 1:6; So 5:14, may rather mean &quot;cylinder&quot; or &quot;rod&quot; of metal. Earring (which see) in the King James Version is from totally different words: nezem, whose etymology is unknown, aghil, &quot;round,&quot; or lachash, &quot;amulet&quot;; so the Revised Version (British and American). The &quot;rings&quot; of the wheels in Eze 1:18 (the King James Version) are gabh, &quot;curved,&quot; and mean &quot;rims&quot; (American Standard Revised Version), &quot;felloes.&quot; Egyptians especially wore a great profusion of rings, principally of silver or gold, engraved with scarabaei, or other devices. In the New Testament the ring, daktulios, &quot;finger-ring,&quot; is a token of means, position, standing: &quot;put a ring on his hand&quot; (Lu 15:22). Perhaps also it included the right to give orders in his father&#x27;s name. To be chrusodaktulios, &quot;golden-ringed,&quot; perhaps with more than one, indicated wealth and social rank: &quot;a man with a gold ring&quot; (Jas 2:2).See also EARRING; SIGNET; SEAL.Philip Wendell Crannell</p>

Did this story suggest Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Rizpah&quot;? A three years&#x27; famine had made David anxious, and in seeking a reason for the affliction he concluded that it lay in Saul&#x27;s unavenged conduct to the Gibeonites (21:2). To appease Yahweh he gave up to the Gibeonites the two sons of Saul, Mephibosheth and Armoni, as well as Saul&#x27;s 5 grandsons (whether by Michal or Merab; see MERAB). These seven were hanged at Gibeah. Rizpah watched 5 months over their exposed bodies, but meanwhile the famine did not abate. Word was brought to David of Rizpah&#x27;s act (21:10,11), and it is possible that her action suggested to David his next step in expiation. At any rate, he remembered the uncared-for bones of Jonathan and Saul lying in ignominy at Jabesh-gilead, whither they had been carried by stealth after the Philistines had kept them hung in the streets of Beth-shan for some time. The bones were recovered and apparently mingled with the bones Rizpah had guarded, and they were together buried in the family grave at Zelah. We are told that then &quot;God was entreated for the land&quot; (21:14).Henry Wallace</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">rob&#x27;-er, rob&#x27;-er-i: &quot;Robber&quot; represents no particular Hebrew word in the Old Testament, but in the Apocrypha and the New Testament is always a translation of lestes (see THIEF). In the King James Version Job 5:5; 18:9, &quot;robber&quot; stands for the doubtful word tsammim, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;hungry&quot; in JOb 5:5 and &quot;snare&quot; in 18:9. The meaning is uncertain, and perhaps tseme&#x27;im, &quot;thirsty,&quot; should be read in both places. Ps 62:10, &quot;Become not vain in robbery,&quot; means &quot;put not your trust in riches dishonestly gained.&quot; RV&#x27;s changes of the King James Version in Pr 21:7; Da 11:14; Na 3:1 are obvious. In Php 2:6 the King James Version reads &quot;thought it not robbery to be equal with God.&quot; the English Revised Version has &quot;a prize,&quot; while the English Revised Version margin and the American Standard Revised Version read &quot;a thing to be grasped,&quot; the American Standard Revised Version rewording &quot;counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped.&quot; The Greek here is harpagmos, a word derived from harpazo, &quot;to ravish away,&quot; &quot;carry off,&quot; &quot;plunder&quot; (compare &quot;harpy&quot;). Properly speaking, the termination -mos should give the derived noun an active sense, &quot;the act of plundering,&quot; whence the King James Version&#x27;s &quot;robbery.&quot; The verse would then mean &quot;who thought that being on an equality with God did not consist in grasping,&quot; and this translation gives good sense in the context and has some excellent scholarly support. But a passive significance is frequently found despite a -mos termination, giving to harpagmos the sense of &quot;thing grasped,&quot; as in the Revised Version (British and American). Usually English commentators take &quot;grasped&quot; as meaning &quot;clung to&quot;--&quot;did not think equality with God should be clung to tenaciously&quot;--but &quot;to cling to&quot; seems unknown as a translation of harpazo. Hence, render &quot;a thing to be grasped at&quot;--did not seek equality with God by selfish methods but by humbling himself.&quot; It is to be noticed, naturally, that Paul is thinking of &quot;equality with God&quot; simply in the sense of &quot;receiving explicit adoration from men&quot; (Php 2:10,11), and that the metaphysical relation of the Son to the Father is not at all in point.See also GRASP.Burton Scott Easton</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">rok ((1) cela`; (2) tsur (3) challamish, &quot;flint&quot;; compare Arabic khalanbus, &quot;flint&quot;; (4) kephim (Job 30:6; Jer 4:29); compare Kephas, &quot;Cephas&quot; = Petros, &quot;Peter&quot; (Joh 1:42 the King James Version and the Revised Version margin); (5) petra):1. Names:Tsur and cela` are the words most often found, and there is no well-defined distinction between them. They are frequently coupled together in the parallelism which is characteristic of the Hebrew writers: e.g.&quot;Be thou to me a strong rock (tsur),A house of defense to save me.For thou art my rock (tsela) and my fortress&quot;(Ps 31:2,3).&quot;He clave rocks (tsur) in the wilderness,And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.He brought streams also out of the rock (sela),And caused waters to run down like rivers&quot;(Ps 78:15,16).It is plain here that the two words are used for the sake of variety, without any clear difference of meaning. Even challamish (translated &quot;flint&quot;) is used in the same way with tsur in Ps 114:8:&quot;Who turned the rock (tsur) into a pool of water;The flint (callamish) into a fountain of waters.&quot;2. Figurative:(1) Some of the most striking and beautiful imagery of the Bible is based upon the rocks. They are a symbol of God: &quot;Yahweh is my rock, and my fortress&quot; (2Sa 22:2; Ps 18:2; 71:3); &quot;God, the rock of my salvation&quot; (2Sa 22:47; compare Ps 62:2,7; 89:26); &quot;my God the rock of my refuge&quot; (Ps 94:22); &quot;the rock of thy strength&quot; (Isa 17:10); &quot;Lead me to the rock that is higher than I&quot; (Ps 61:2); repeatedly in the song of Moses (De 32:3,4,18,30,31; compare 2Sa 22:32). Paul applies the rock smitten in the wilderness (Ex 17:6; Nu 20:11) to Christ as the source of living water for spiritual refreshment (1Co 10:4).(2) The rocks are a refuge, both figuratively and literally (Jer 48:28; So 2:14); &quot;The rocks are a refuge for the conies&quot; (Ps 104:18). Many a traveler in Palestine has felt the refreshment of &quot;the shade of a great rock in a weary land&quot; (Isa 32:2). A very different idea is expressed in Isa 8:14, &quot;And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense&quot; (compare Ro 9:33; 1Pe 2:8).(3) The rock is a symbol of hardness (Jer 5:3; compare Isa 50:7). Therefore, the breaking of the rock exemplifies the power of God (Jer 23:29; compare 1Ki 19:11). The rock is also a symbol of that which endures, &quot;Oh that they .... were graven in the rock for ever!&quot; (Job 19:23,24). A rock was an appropriate place for offering a sacrifice (Jud 6:20; 13:19). The central feature of the Mosque of `Umar in Jerusalem is Qubbat-uc-Cakhrat, the &quot;dome of the rock.&quot; The rock or cakhrat under the dome is thought to be the site of Solomon&#x27;s altar of burnt offering, and further is thought to be the site of the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite which David purchased to build an altar to Yahweh.3. Kinds of Rock:(1) The principal rock of Palestine and Syria is limestone of which there are many varieties, differing in color, texture, hardness and degrees of impurity, some of the limestone having co...</p>

ShebheT is used, but sometimes also maTTeh, of the rod used for correction (Ex 21:20; 2Sa 7:14; Pr 10:13; 13:24; Isa 10:5, etc.). In Ps 23:4 (&quot;Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me&quot;), however, shebheT is the shepherd&#x27;s rod, figurative of divine guidance and care. In Eze 21:10,13, the word stands for the royal scepter. In the New Testament &quot;rod&quot; is used of a rod of correction (1Co 4:21), Aaron&#x27;s rod (Heb 9:4), a ruler&#x27;s rod &quot;of iron&quot; (severity, as in Re 2:27; 12:5; 19:15), a measuring rod (Re 11:1).See also ARMOR, ARMS.James Orr</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">rol: The usual form of book in Biblical times. It had been in use in Egypt for perhaps 2,000 years at the time when, according to the Pentateuch, the earliest Biblical books were written in this form. The Babylonian tablet seems to have been the prevailing form in Palestine up to about 1350 BC, but by 1100 BC, at least, the roll had been in established use for some time as far North as Byblos. Two Hebrew words, gillayon, meghillah, one Aramaic, cephar, and one Greek word, biblion, are so translated in the King James Version. Cephar (Ezr 6:1, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;archives, margin &quot;books&quot;), with the corresponding Hebrew form cepher, is the generic word for any whole work large or small, but as a book form (Isa 34:4) it may mean &quot;roll,&quot; and, according to Blau (pp. 37, 45, etc.), it never does mean anything else. Both the other words seem to be connected with galal, &quot;roll,&quot; which is the technical term for opening or closing a book. The meghillath cepher (Jer 36:2) means the unwritten roll, or the roll considered in its material form as contrasted with the work. Meghillah, which is found in Ezr 6:2 (English Versions of the Bible, &quot;roll&quot;), Jeremiah (often), Ezekiel (often) and Zechariah, is a somewhat late word, and came to mean a small roll (but with a complete work) as distinguished from a book, corresponding thus to the modern distinction of pamphlet and book or document and book. The word gillayon is translated in the Revised Version (British and American) as &quot;tablet,&quot; and is universally regarded as meaning (Isa 8:1) some smooth surface, corresponding to the same word in Isa 3:23 which is rendered &quot;hand-mirror.&quot; But &quot;cylinder-seal&quot; would possibly fit the sense in both cases; this being hung round the neck as an ornament in one case and inscribed with a personal name in the other.Biblion is regarded by the Bible translators as equivalent to meghillah in the sense of small roll. It is in fact 4 times in the Septuagint of Jer 36 used as the translation for meghillah, but very much oftener it is the translation for cepher, for which in fact it is the correct technical equivalent (Birt, Buchrolle, 21). Indeed the &quot;small book&quot; (Thayer, Lexicon, 101) is hardly consistent with the ideas of the heavens as a scroll, of the Lamb&#x27;s Book of Life, or of the vast quantity of books of Joh 21:25, although in Lu 4:17 it may perhaps correspond closely with meghillah in the sense of a complete roll and work, which is at the same time a whole part of a larger work. Its use in Re 6:14 is reminiscent of Isa 34:4 (&quot;scroll&quot;), and is conclusive for the roll form. It is indeed always technically a roll and never codex or tablet.It is not likely that Isaiah and John (here and in his Gospel, 21:25) refer directly to the Babylonian idea that the heavens are a series of written tablets or to the rabbinic saying that &quot;if all the oceans were ink, all reeds pens, the heavens and earth sheets to write upon, and all men writers, still it would not suffice for w...</p>

VICTORY OF CHRISTIANITY AND CONVERSION OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE1. Negative Causes2. Positive CausesLITERATUREI. Outline of the Roman Empire.1. Roman Empire a Result of Social Conflict:The founding of the Roman empire was the grandest political achievement ever accomplished. The conquests of Alexander the Great, Charlemagne and Napoleon seem small compared with the durable structure reared by Julius and his successor, Augustus. In one sense Julius Caesar--the most wonderful man that Rome or any other country produced--was the founder of the empire, and Augustus the founder of the principate. But the Roman empire was the culmination of a long process of political, constitutional, and social growth which gives a lasting interest to Roman history. The Roman empire was the only possible solution of a 700 years&#x27; struggle, and Roman history is the story of the conflict of class with class, patrician against plebeian, populus against plebs, the antagonism of oligarchy and democracy, plutocracy against neglected masses. It is the account of the triumphant march of democracy and popular government against an exclusive governing caste. Against heavy odds the plebeians asserted their rights till they secured at least a measure of social, political and legal equality with their superiors (see ROME, I, 2-4). But in the long conflict both parties degenerated until neither militant democracy nor despotic oligarchy could hold the balance with justice...</p>

The Right of Appeal(1) Penalties(2) The Porcian Law3. Popular Jurisdiction Curtailed4. Jurors5. Disappearance of Criminal Courts6. Right of Trial at RomeLITERATUREIn the present article we shall treat (I) Roman Private Law and (II) Criminal Law only, reserving a consideration of the development of the principles of constitutional law for the article on ROME, since it is so closely interwoven with the political history of the state.It will be necessary to confine the discussion of private law to its external history, without attempting to deal with the substance of the law itself. In the treatment of criminal law attention will be directed chiefly to the constitutional guaranties which were intended to protect Roman citizens against arbitrary and unjust punishments, these being one of the most important privileges of Roman citizenship.See CITIZENSHIP.Roman law found its original source in the family as a corporation. The proprietary rights of the pater familias as representative of this primitive unit of organization are a fundamental element in private law, and the scope of the criminal jurisdiction of the state was limited by the power of life and death which was exercised by the head of the family over those who were under his authority, by virtue of which their transgressions were tried before the domestic tribunal.It is likewise of fundamental importance to recall the fact that before the earliest period in the history of Roman law of which we have positive information, there must have been a time when a large number of different classes of crime were punished by the priests as sacrilege, in accordance with divine law (fas), by putting the offender to death as a sacrifice to the offended deity, while restitution for private violence or injustice was left to private initiative to seek. For a law of the Twelve Tables that the person guilty of cutting another&#x27;s grain by night should be hanged, as an offering to Ceres, is a survival of the older religious character of condemnation to death, and the right to kill the nocturnal thief and the adulterer caught in the act may be cited as survivals of primitive private vengeance The secular conception of crime as an offense against the welfare of the state gradually superseded the older conception, while private law arose when the community did away with the disorder incident to the exercise of self-help in attempting to secure justice, by insisting that the parties to a disagreement should submit their claims to an arbitrator.I. Roman Private Law.1. The Twelve Tables:Roman private law was at first a body of unwritten usages handed down by tradition in the patrician families.

Main Teachings of the Epistle(1) Doctrine of Man(2) Doctrine of God(3) Doctrine of Son of God--Redemption; Justification(4) Doctrine of the Spirit of God(5) Doctrine of Duty(6) Doctrine of IsraelLITERATUREThis is the greatest, in every sense, of the apostolic letters of Paul; in scale, in scope, and in its wonderful combination of doctrinal, ethical and administrative wisdom and power. In some respects the later Epistles, Ephesians and Colossians, lead us to even higher and deeper arcana of revelation, and they, like Romans, combine with the exposition of truth a luminous doctrine of duty. But the range of Roman is larger in both directions, and presents us also with noble and far-reaching discussions of Christian polity, instructions in spiritual utterance and the like, to which those Epistles present no parallel, and which only the Corinthian Epistles rival.1. Its Genuineness:No suspicion on the head of the genuineness of the Epistle exists which needs serious consideration. Signs of the influence of the Epistle can be traced, at least very probably, in the New Testament itself; in 1 Peter, and, as some think, in James. But in our opinion Jas was the earlier writing, and Lightfoot has given strong grounds for the belief that the paragraph on faith and justification (Jas 2) has no reference to perversions of Pauline teaching, but deals with rabbinism. Clement of Rome repeatedly quotes Romans, and so do Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin. Marcion includes it in his list of Pauline Epistles, and it is safe to say in general Romans &quot;has been recognized in the Christian church as long as any collection of Paul&#x27;s Epistles has been extant&quot; (A. Robertson, in HDB, under the word). But above all other evidences it testifies to itself. The fabrication of such a writing, with its close and complex thought, its power and marked originality of treatment, its noble morale, and its spiritual elevation and ardor, is nothing short of a moral impossibility. A mighty mind and equally great heart live in every page, and a soul exquisitely sensitive and always intent upon truth and holiness. Literary personation is an art which has come to anything like maturity only in modern times, certainly not before the Renaissance. In a fully developed form it is hardly earlier than the 19th century. And even now who can point to a consciously personated authorship going along with high moral principle and purpose?2. Its Integrity:The question remains, however, whether, accepting the Epistle in block as Pauline, we have it, as to details, just as it left the author&#x27;s hands. Particularly, some phenomena of the text of the last two chapter invite the inquiry. We may--in our opinion we must--grant those chapters to be Pauline. They breathe Paul in every sentence. But do they read precisely like part of a letter to Rome? For example, ...</p>

PersecutionLITERATURERome (Latin and Italian, Roma; Rhome): The capital of the Roman republic and empire, later the center of Lot Christendom, and since 1871 capital of the kingdom of Italy, is situated mainly on the left bank of the Tiber about 15 miles from the Mediterranean Sea in 41 degrees 53&#x27; 54 inches North latitude and 12 degrees 0&#x27; 12 inches longitude East of Greenwich.It would be impossible in the limited space assigned to this article to give even a comprehensive outline of the ancient history of the Eternal City. It will suit the general purpose of the work to consider the relations of the Roman government and society with the Jews and Christians, and, in addition, to present a rapid survey of the earlier development of Roman institutions and power, so as to provide the necessary historical setting for the appreciation of the more essential subjects.I. Development of the Republican Constitution.1. Original Roman State:The traditional chronology for the earliest period of Roman history is altogether unreliable, partly because the Gauls, in ravaging the city in 390 BC, destroyed the monuments which might have offered faithful testimony of the earlier period (Livy vi.1). It is known that there was a settlement on the site of Rome before the traditional date of the founding (753 BC). The original Roman state was the product of the coalition of a number of adjacent clan-communities, whose names were perpetuated in the Roman genres, or groups of imaginary kindred, a historical survival which had lost all significance in the period of authentic history. The chieftains of the associated clans composed the primitive senate or council of elders, which exercised sovereign authority. But as is customary in the development of human society a military or monarchical regime succeeded the looser patriarchal or sacerdotal organs of authority. This second stage may be identified with the legendary rule of the Tarquins, which was probably a period of Etruscan domination. The confederacy of clans was welded into a homogeneous political entity, and society was organized for civic ends, upon a timocratic basis. The forum was drained and became a social, industrial and political center, and the Capitoline temple of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva (Etruscan pseudo-Hellenic deities) was erected as a common shrine for all the people. But above all the Romans are indebted to these foreign kings for a training in discipline and obedience which was exemplified in the later c...</p>

In neither word is any specified thickness or strength connoted, and chebhel is translated equally well by &quot;line&quot; (2Sa 8:2, etc.) or &quot;cord&quot; (Jos 2:15, etc.), and `abhoth by &quot;cord&quot; (Ps 118:27, etc.), as best suits the context. Similarly in the New Testament the word schoinion, literally, &quot;made of rushes&quot; can mean the rope by which a boat is fastened (Ac 27:32) or small cords suitable for a whip (Joh 2:15). The usual material for ropes was certainly flax (hemp), but the Egyptians, and so possibly the Hebrews, at times made ropes of leathern thongs.See CORD; LINE; SHIPS AND BOATS, III, 2.Burton Scott Easton</p>

A Targum on So 2:1 explains the Hebrew word as &quot;narcissus&quot; , a very common plant in the plains and mountains of Palestine and a great favorite with the natives. Two species, N. tazetta and N. serolinus (Natural Order, Amaryllideae), occur, the latter being the finer; they are autumn plants. All authorities agree that the so-called &quot;rose&quot; was some kind of bulbed plant. (2) (rhodon, &quot;the rose,&quot; mentioned in Ecclesiasticus 24:14; 39:13; 50:8; The Wisdom of Solomon 2:8; 2 Esdras 2:19): There is no reason why the rose, of which several varieties are common in Palestine, should not be meant. Tristram favors the rhododendron. The expression, &quot;rose plants in Jericho,&quot; in Ecclesiasticus 24:14 has nothing whatever to do with what is now sold there as a &quot;rose of Jericho,&quot; a dwarf annual plant, Anastatica hierochuntina (Natural Order, Cruciferae), which dries up and can be made to reexpand by placing the root in water.E.

Rosh and Its Renderings:This name occurs in the prophecies against Gog in Eze 38:2,3 and 39:1, where the King James Version has &quot;Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.&quot; This translation is due to ro&#x27;sh being the common Hebrew word for &quot;head&quot; or &quot;chief&quot; (compare the Greek variant and the Vulgate), and is regarded as incorrect, that of the Revised Version (British and American), &quot;Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech and Tubal,&quot; being preferred.2. Identification with Russia:The identification of Rosh is not without its difficulties. Gesenius regarded it as indicating the Russians, who are mentioned in Byzantine writers of the 10th century under the name of Rhos. He adds that they are also noticed by Ibn Fosslan (same period), under the name of Rus, as a people dwelling on the river Rha (Volga). Apart from the improbability that the dominion of Gog extended to this district, it would be needful to know at what date the Rus of the Volga arrived there.3. Probably the Assyrian Rasu:Notwithstanding objections on account of its eastern position, in all probability Fried. Delitzsch&#x27;s identification of Rosh with the mat Rasi, &quot;land of Rash&quot; of the Assyrian inscriptions, is the best. Sargon of Assyria (circa 710 BC) conquered the countries &quot;from the land of Rasu on the border of Elam as far as the river of Egypt,&quot; and this country is further described in his Khorsabad Inscription, 18, as &quot;the land of Rasu, of the boundary of Elam, which is beside the Tigris.&quot; Assyria having disappeared from among the nations when Ezekiel wrote his prophecies, Babylonia was probably the only power with which &quot;Gog of the land of Magog&quot; would have had to reckon, but it may well be doubted whether the Babylonian king would have allowed him to exercise power in the district of Rasu, except as a very faithful vassal. It may here be noted that the Hebrew spelling of Rosh presupposes an earlier pronunciation as Rash, a form agreeing closely with that used by the Assyrians. See Fried.

In the two passages in Galatians, and in the two in 2 Peter, it is rendered &quot;elements.&quot; In the two passages in Colossians, it is translated &quot;rudiments.&quot; In He it is rendered &quot;first principles.&quot;1. Etymological Meaning:The etymological meaning of the word is, that which belongs to a row or rank, hence any first thing, an element, first principle. It denotes, specially(1) the letters of the alphabet, the spoken sounds, as the elements of speech;(2) the material elements of the universe, the physical atoms of which the world is composed;(3) the heavenly bodies;(4) the elements, rudiments, fundamental principles of any art, science or discipline; compare the phrase, &quot;the a, b, c.&quot;2. Use of Term in the New Testament:(1) The New Testament use of the word, where it always occurs in the plural, is as follows: In 2Pe 3:10,12, &quot;The elements shall be dissolved with fervent heat,&quot; that is, the physical elements of the world and of the heavens are to be consumed, or subjected to change, by means of fire. In Heb 5:12, the King James Version &quot;Ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God.&quot; This means that the Hebrew Christians had not made the advance expected, in grace and in the knowledge of God, but were in need of instruction in the elementary truths of the Christian faith.(2) The Pauline use of the term is in Galatians and Colossians; see references as above. In Ga 4:3,9 the King James Version Paul writes, &quot;When we were children, (we) were in bondage under the elements of the world&quot;; &quot;How turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?&quot; The apostle here means the ceremonial precepts of the worship of the Jews. These requirements involved much and protracted difficulty in their observance; they were &quot;a yoke .... which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear&quot; (Ac 15:10). Yet the Galatian converts were tuning back again to these legal ordinances, and desired to be in bondage to them. These elements were &quot;of the world,&quot; they had reference to material and not to spiritual things, they were formal and sensuous. They were &quot;weak,&quot; for they had no power to rescue man from condemnation, and they could not save him from sin. They were &quot;beggarly,&quot; for they brought no endowment of the heavenly riches. By these epithets Paul signifies that rites, ordinances, sacrifices, observance of days and seasons belonged to the elementary stages of the Jewish religion, which had now attained its end and purpose in the coming of Christ and His work. These things were necessary at the time they were divinely instituted, but the time had come when they were no longer required. They contained and conveyed an elementary knowledge, and were intended, from the first, to lead to an advance in the m...</p>

There seems no reason to doubt, therefore, that the Rufus of Mark and the Rufus of Paul are the same person. The name, meaning &quot;red,&quot; &quot;reddish,&quot; was, however, one of the commonest of slave names; the identification of these two is therefore merely a conjecture. The Rufus whom Paul greets is &quot;the chosen in the Lord,&quot; i.e. &quot;that choice Christian&quot; (Denhey). Since all Christians are &quot;chosen,&quot; this title must express some distinction. The mother of Rufus had played the mother&#x27;s part to Paul on some occasion of which we are ignorant, hence the phrase &quot;his mother and mine&quot; (compare Mr 10:30).S. F. Hunter</p>

In the Old Testament:(1) moshel, &quot;ruler,&quot; &quot;prince,&quot; &quot;master&quot; (tyrant), applied to Joseph in Egypt (Ge 45:8; compare Ps 105:21); to the Philistines (Jud 15:11); to David&#x27;s descendants, the future kings of Israel (2Ch 7:18; compare Jer 33:26); to Pharaoh (Ps 105:20); to a wicked prince, a tyrant (Pr 28:15; compare Isa 14:5; 49:7); to theocratic king, the Messiah (Mic 5:2); it is often used in general (Pr 6:7; 23:1; 29:12; Ec 10:4; Isa 16:1, etc.).(2) naghidh, &quot;leader,&quot; &quot;noble&quot; (nobles), &quot;prince.&quot; In a number of instances the Revised Version (British and American) renders it &quot;prince,&quot; where the King James Version has ruler (1Sa 25:30; 2Sa 6:21; 1Ki 1:35, etc.). It is used of Azrikam having charge of the palace of King Ahaz (2Ch 28:7, &quot;governor&quot; of the house, the King James Version); of Azariah (Seraiah, Ne 11:11), who is called the &quot;ruler of the house of God&quot; (1Ch 9:11; compare 2Ch 31:13); he was the leader of a division or group of priests. In 2Ch 35:8 the names of three others are given (Hilkiah, Zechariah and Jehiel).(3) nasi, &quot;prince&quot; (so Nu 13:2, the King James Version &quot;ruler&quot;); generally speaking, the nasi&#x27; is one of the public authorities (Ex 22:28); the rulers of the congregation (Ex 16:22; compare 34:31); &quot;The rulers brought the onyx stones&quot; (Ex 35:27), as it was to be expected from men of their social standing and financial ability: &quot;when a ruler (the head of a tribe or tribal division) sinneth&quot; (Le 4:22).(4) caghan, the representative of a king or a prince; a vice-regent; a governor; then, in the times of Ezra and Nehemiah, a leader or principal of the people of Jerusalem under the general supervision of these two men. The English Versions of the Bible renders it &quot;ruler&quot; (Eze 23:12,23), &quot;deputy&quot; (Jer 51:23,28,57), and, in most cases, &quot;ruler&quot; with &quot;deputy&quot; in margin (Ezr 9:2; Ne 2:16; 4:14,19; 5:7,17; 7:5; 12:40; 13:11; Isa 41:25; Eze 23:6) always used in plural(5) qatsin, &quot;a judge&quot; or &quot;magistrate&quot; (Isa 1:10; 3:6,7; 22:3; Mic 3:1,9); &quot;a military chief&quot; (Jos 10:24).(6) rodheh, one having dominion: &quot;There is little Benjamin their ruler&quot; (Ps 68:27); the meaning is obscure; still we may point to the facts that Saul, the first one to conquer the heathen (1Sa 14:47 f), came of this the smallest of all the tribes, and that within its boundaries the temple of Yahweh was erected.(7) rozen, a &quot;dignitary,&quot; a &quot;prince.&quot; &quot;The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against Yahweh&quot; (Ps 2:2); in the New Testament the word is rendered archontes (Ac 4:26).(8) sar, &quot;chief,&quot; &quot;head&quot;; prince, king; a nobleman having judicial or other power; a royal officer. The Revised Version (British and American) renders it frequently &quot;prince&quot;: &quot;rulers over my cattle&quot; (&quot;head-shepherds,&quot; Ge 47:6); &quot;rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds,&quot; etc. (Ex 18:21); they had to be men of good character because they were endowed with judicial power (Ex 18:22); in De 1:15 the rendering of English Versions of the Bible is captains,&quot; etc.; they ...</p>

According to Ecclesiasticus (32:1) it was customary to appoint a &quot;master of the ceremonies&quot; from among the invited guests. It was his duty to determine the places of the guests, to see that the ordinary rules of etiquette were observed, etc., and generally to supervise the arrangements. The Revised Version margin &quot;steward&quot; is possible if the &quot;governor of the feast&quot; meant the &quot;head waiter&quot; (Merx renders &quot;head servant of the feast&quot;), and not one of the guests appointed for the purpose. But the context is in favor of the view that the person in question was one of the prominent guests--an intimate friend or relative of the host.See RULER, 2, (2).T. Lewis</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">roo&#x27;-ma (rumah; Codex Vaticanus Rhouma; Codex Alexandrinus Rhuma): To this place belonged Pedaiah whose daughter Zebudah (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;Zebidah&quot;) entered the harem of Josiah, king of Judah, and became the mother of Jehoiakim (2Ki 23:36). Josephus (Ant., X, v, 2) calls the place Abouma, but this is an obvious clerical error for Arouma. This suggests a possible identification with Arumah (Jud 9:41), which lay not far from Shechem. Another possible identification is with the Rumah mentioned by Josephus (BJ, III, vii, 21) in Galilee (compare Neubauer, Geog. du Talmud, 203), which may be identical with the modern Khirbet Rumeh, about 3 miles North of Seffuriyeh. Some, however, would identify Rumah with Dumah of Jos 15:52, where the substitution of &quot;r&quot; for &quot;d&quot; is supported by the Septuagint (Rheuma), possibly represented by the modern Domeh, about 13 miles Southeast of Beit Jibrin. This of course was in the territory of Judah, and no question of jus connubium is involved, such as might arise in the case of a Galilean site.W. Ewing</p>

It was one of those portions of the peace and trespass offering which were not eaten by the priest or the sacrificer, but which with other choice portions were waved before the Lord and wholly burnt on the altar as a sweet savor unto Yahweh.</p>

This plant, the finest of the sedges, flourishes plentifully in Upper Egypt; in Palestine there is a great mass of it growing in the marsh to the North of Lake Huleh, and it also occurs on the Lake of Galilee and the Jordan. Light boats of plaited papyrus have been used on the Nile from ancient times and are mentioned by many writers (compare Ex 2:3; Isa 18:2).(2) (&#x27;aghmon, &quot;rope,&quot; margin &quot;Hebrew `a rope of rushes,&#x27; &quot; the King James Version &quot;hook&quot; (Job 41:2): &quot;(burning) rushes,&quot; the King James Version &quot;caldron&quot; (Job 41:20); &quot;rush,&quot; the King James Version &quot;bulrush&quot; (Isa 58:5); &quot;rush&quot; in Isa 9:14; 19:15, used of the humble and lowly folk as contrasted with the &quot;palm branch,&quot; the highest class): The word &#x27;aghmon comes from &#x27;agham, meaning a marsh (see POOL), being transferred from the place of the things growing there.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">rust (chel&#x27;ah; brosis): Strictly speaking rust is the red oxide of iron formed by the corrosion of that metal, but by extension it has come to mean corrosion produced on any metal. Chel&#x27;ah is translated &quot;rust&quot; in Eze 24:11,12. This rendering is probably based on 24:11. Copper caldrons are still used in Bible lands. Such vessels must be constantly watched when on the fire to guard against the possibility of their becoming dry. If this should happen the contents, whatever they may be, and the vessel itself will be injured. The copper of the caldron oxidizes and scales off in black or brownish scales, or rust. ios, was used in Greek to denote the corroding of metals. In Jas 5:3 occurs, &quot;Your gold and your silver are rusted; and their rust .... shall eat your flesh as fire.&quot; The writers must have had in mind the actions of chemicals upon these metals which formed some such compound as the caustic silver nitrate.Brosis, literally, &quot;eating,&quot; which occurs in Mt 6:19,20, may refer to the diseases which attack such vegetation as wheat, grapes, cucumbers, etc. In no country is the saying &quot;where moth and rust consume&quot; (Mt 6:19) more true than in Syria. Any metal subject to corrosion seems to rust faster in that country than anywhere else. There are also many rusting fungi which the people have not learned to destroy and which do much damage to the crops.See also SCUM.James A. Patch</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">rooth (ruth; Rhouth): The name Ru is found in the Old Testament only in the book which is so entitled. It is a contraction for re&#x27;uth perhaps signifying &quot;comrade,&quot; &quot;companion&quot; (feminine; compare Ex 11:2, &quot;every woman of her neighbor&quot;). OHL, 946, explains the word as an abstract noun = &quot;friendship.&quot; The Book of Ru details the history of the one decisive episode owing to which Ru became an ancestress of David and of the royal house of Judah. From this point of view its peculiar interest lies in the close friendship or alliance between Israel and Moab, which rendered such a connection possible. Not improbably also there is an allusion to this in the name itself.1. History:The history lies in the period of the Judges (Ru 1:1), at the close of a great famine in the land of Israel. Elimelech, a native of Bethlehem, had, with his wife Naomi and two sons, taken refuge in Moab from the famine. There, after an interval of time which is not more precisely defined, he died (Ru 1:3), and his two sons, having married women of Moab, in the course of a further ten years also died, and left Orpah and Ru widows (Ru 1:5). Naomi then decided to return to Palestine, and her two daughters-in-law accompanied her on her way (Ru 1:7). Orpah, however, turned back and only Ru remained with Naomi, journeying with her to Bethlehem, where they arrived &quot;in the beginning of barley harvest&quot; (Ru 1:22). The piety and fidelity of Ru are thus early exhibited in the course of the narrative, in that she refused to abandon her mother-in-law, although thrice exhorted to do so by Naomi herself, on account of her own great age and the better prospects for Ru in her own country. Orpah yielded to persuasion, and returned to Moab; but Ru remained with Naomi.At Bethlehem Ru employed herself in gleaning in the field during the harvest and was noticed by Boaz, the owner of the field, a near kinsman of her father-in-law Elimelech. Boaz gave her permission to glean as long as the harvest continued; and told her that he had heard of her filial conduct toward her mother-in-law. Moreover, he directed the reapers to make intentional provision for her by dropping in her way grain from their bundles (Ru 2:15 f). She was thus able to return to Naomi in the evening with a whole ephah of barley (Ru 2:17). In answer to questioning she explained that her success in gleaning was due to the good-will of Boaz, and the orders that he had given. She remained accordingly and gleaned with his maidens throughout the barley and wheat harvest, making her home with her mother-in-law (Ru 2:23). Naomi was anxious for the remarriage of Ruth, both for her sake and to secure compliance with the usage and law of Israel; and sent her to Boaz to recall to him his duty as near kinsman of her late husband Elimelech (Ru 3:1 f). Boaz acknowledged the claim and promised to take Ru in marriage, failing fulfillment of the legal duty of another whose relationship was nearer than that of Boaz himself (Ru 3:8-13). Naomi was confident t...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">1. Order in the Canon:The place which the Book of Ru occupies in the order of the books of the English Bible is not that of the Hebrew Canon. There it is one of the five meghilloth or Rolls, which were ordered to be read in the synagogue on 5 special occasions or festivals during the year.In printed editions of the Old Testament the megilloth are usually arranged in the order: Cant, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiates, Esther. Ru occupied the second position because the book was appointed to be read at the Feast of Weeks which was the second of the 5 special days. In Hebrew manuscripts, however, the order varies considerably. In Spanish manuscripts generally, and in one at least of the German school cited by Dr. Ginsburg (Introduction to the Hebrew Bible, London, 1897, 4), Ru precedes Cant; and in the former Ecclesiastes is placed before Lamentations. The meghilloth constitute the second portion of the kethubhim or Haigographa, the third great division of the books of the Hebrew Scriptures. The Talmud, however, dissociates Ru altogether from the remaining meghilloth, and places it first among the Hagiographa, before the Book of Psalms. By the Greek translators the book was removed from the position which it held in the Hebrew Canon, and because it described events contemporaneous with the Judges, was attached as a kind of appendix to the latter work. This sequence was adopted in the Vulgate, and so has passed into all modern Bibles.2. Authorship and Purpose:The book is written without name of author, and there is no direct indication of its date. Its aim is to record an event of interest and importance in the family history of David, and incidentally to illustrate ancient custom and marriage law. There is no ground for supposing, as has been suggested, that the writer had a polemical purpose in view, and desired to show that the strict and stern action taken by Ezra and Nehemiah after the return in forbidding mixed marriages was not justifled by precedent. The narrative is simple and direct, and the preservation of the tradition which it records of the descent of Israel&#x27;s royal house from a Moabite ancestress was probably due in the first instance to oral communication for some considerable time before it was committed to writing. The Book of 1Sa also indicates a close relation between David and Moab, when during the period of his outlawry the future king confided his father and mother to the care of the king of Moab (1Sa 22:3 f), and so far supports the truth of the tradition which is embodied in the Book of Ruth.3. Date of Composition:With regard to the date at which the narrative was committed to writing, it is evident from the position of the Book of Ru in the Hebrew Canon that the date of its composition is subsequent to the close of the great period of the &quot;earlier prophets.&quot; Otherwise it would have found a natural place, as was assigned to it in the Greek Bible, together with the Book of Judges and other historical writings, in the second divi...</p>
