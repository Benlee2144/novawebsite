Family:Probably eldest son of Amram (Ex 6:20), and according to the uniform genealogical lists (Ex 6:16-20; 1Ch 6:1-3), the fourth from Levi. This however is not certainly fixed, since there are frequent omissions from the Hebrew lists of names which are not prominent in the line of descent. For the corresponding period from Levi to Aaron the Judah list has six names (Ru 4:18-20; 1Ch 2). Levi and his family were zealous, even to violence (Ge 34:25; Ex 32:26), for the national honor and religion, and Aaron no doubt inherited his full portion of this spirit. His mother&#x27;s name was Jochebed, who was also of the Levitical family (Ex 6:20). Miriam, his sister, was several years older, since she was set to watch the novel cradle of the infant brother Moses, at whose birth Aaron was three years old (Ex 7:7).2. Becomes Moses&#x27; Assistant:When Moses fled from Egypt, Aaron remained to share the hardships of his people, and possibly to render them some service; for we are told that Moses entreated of God his brother&#x27;s cooperation in his mission to Pharaoh and to Israel, and that Aaron went out to meet his returning brother, as the time of deliverance drew near (Ex 4:27). While Moses, whose great gifts lay along other lines, was slow of speech (Ex 4:10), Aaron was a ready spokesman, and became his brother&#x27;s representative, being called his &quot;mouth&quot; (Ex 4:16) and his &quot;prophet&quot; (Ex 7:1). After their meeting in the wilderness the two brothers returned together to Egypt on the hazardous mission to which Yahweh had called them (Ex 4:27-31). At first they appealed to their own nation, recalling the ancient promises and declaring the imminent deliverance, Aaron being the spokesman. But the heart of the people, hopeless by reason of the hard bondage and heavy with the care of material things, did not incline to them. The two brothers then forced the issue by appealing directly to Pharaoh himself, Aaron still speaking for his brother (Ex 6:10-13). He also performed, at Moses&#x27; direction, the miracles which confounded Pharaoh and his magicians. With Hur, he held up Moses hands, in order that the `rod of God might be lifted up,&#x27; during the fight with Amalek (Ex 17:10,12).3. An Elder:Aaron next comes into prominence when at Sinai he is one of the elders and representatives of his tribe to approach nearer to the Mount than the people in general were allowed to do, and to see the manifested glory of God (Ex 24:1,9,10). A few days later, when Moses, attended by his &quot;minister&quot; Joshua, went up into the mountain, Aaron exercised some kind of headship over the people in his absence. Despairing of seeing again their leader, who had disappeared into the mystery of com...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(Nu 17 and He 9:4): Immediately after the incidents connected with the rebellion of Korah, Dathan and Abiram against the leadership of Moses and the priestly primacy of Aaron (Nu 16), it became necessary to indicate and emphasize the Divine appointment of Aaron. Therefore, at the command of Yahweh, Moses directs that twelve almond rods, one for each tribe with the prince&#x27;s name engraved thereon, be placed within the Tent of the Testimony. When Moses entered the tent the following day, he found that Aaron&#x27;s rod had budded, blossomed and borne fruit, &quot;the three stages of vegetable life being thus simultaneously visible.&quot; When the miraculous sign was seen by the people, they accepted it as final; nor was there ever again any question of Aaron&#x27;s priestly right. The rod was kept &quot;before the testimony&quot; in the sanctuary ever after as a token of the Divine will (Nu 17:10). The writer of Hebrews, probably following a later Jewish tradition, mentions the rod as kept in the Holy of Holies within the ark (He 9:4; compare 1Ki 8:9). See PRIEST, III.Edward Mack</p>

It is equivalent to the phrases &quot;sons of Aaron,&quot; &quot;house of Aaron,&quot; frequently used in the Old Testament. According to the books of Jos and Chronicles the &quot;sons of Aaron,&quot; were distinguished from the other Levites from the time of Joshua (e.g. Jos 21:4,10,13; 1Ch 6:54).</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(&#x27;abh, the Hebrew and Aramaic word for &quot;father&quot;): It is a very common word in the Old Testament; this article notes only certain uses of it. It is used both in the singular and in the plural to denote a grandfather or more remote ancestors (e.g. Jer 35:16,15). The father of a people or tribe is its founder, not, as is frequently assumed, its progenitor. In this sense Abraham is father to the Israelites (see, for example, Ge 17:11-14,27), Isaac and Jacob and the heads of families being fathers in the same modified sense. The cases of Ishmael, Moab, etc., are similar. The traditional originator of a craft is the father of those who practice the craft (e.g. Ge 4:20,21,22). Sennacherib uses the term &quot;my fathers&quot; of his predecessors on the throne of Assyria, though these were not his ancestors (2Ki 19:12). The term is used to express worth and affection irrespective of blood relation (e.g. 2Ki 13:14). A ruler or leader is spoken of as a father. God is father. A frequent use of the word is that in the composition of proper names, e.g. Abinadab, &quot;my father is noble.&quot; See ABI.The Aramaic word in its definite form is used three times in the New Testament (Mr 4:6), the phrase being in each case &quot;Abba Father,&quot; addressed to God. In this phrase the word &quot;Father&quot; is added, apparently, not as a mere translation, nor to indicate that Abba is thought of as a proper name of Deity, but as a term of pleading and of endearment.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-bad&#x27;-on (&#x27;abhaddon, &quot;ruin,&quot; &quot;perdition,&quot; &quot;destruction&quot;): Though &quot;destruction&quot; is commonly used in translating &#x27;abhaddon, the stem idea is intransitive rather than passive--the idea of perishing, going to ruin, being in a ruined state, rather than that of being ruined, being destroyed.The word occurs six times in the Old Testament, always as a place name in the sense in which Sheol is a place name. It denotes, in certain aspects, the world of the dead as constructed in the Hebrew imagination. It is a common mistake to understand such expressions in a too mechanical way. Like ourselves, the men of the earlier ages had to use picture language when they spoke of the conditions that existed after death, however their picturing of the matter may have differed from ours. In three instances Abaddon is parallel with Sheol (Job 26:6; Pr 15:11; 27:20). In one instance it is parallel with death, in one with the grave and in the remaining instance the parallel phrase is &quot;root out all mine increase&quot; (Job 28:22; Ps 88:11; Job 31:12). In this last passage the place idea comes nearer to vanishing in an abstract conception than in the other passages.Abaddon belongs to the realm of the mysterious. Only God understands it (Job 26:6; Pr 15:11). It is the world of the dead in its utterly dismal, destructive, dreadful aspect, not in those more cheerful aspects in which activities are conceived of as in progress there. In Abaddon there are no declarations of God&#x27;s lovingkindness (Ps 88:11).In a slight degree the Old Testament presentations personalize Abaddon. It is a synonym for insatiableness (Pr 27:20). It has possibilities of information mediate between those of &quot;all living&quot; and those of God (Job 28:22).In the New Testament the word occurs once (Re 9:11), the personalization becoming sharp. Abaddon is here not the world of the dead, but the angel who reigns over it. The Greek equivalent of his name is given as Apollyon. Under this name Bunyan presents him in the Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress, and Christendom has doubtless been more interested in this presentation of the matter than in any other.In some treatments Abaddon is connected with the evil spirit Asmodeus of Tobit (e.g. 3:8), and with the destroyer mentioned in The Wisdom of Solomon (18:25; compare 22), and through these with a large body of rabbinical folklore; but these efforts are simply groundless.

Both forms of the name may have been in use, as the interchange of an aspirated b (bh = v) and m is not without parallel (compare Evil-merodach = Amilmarduk).The Abanah is identified with the Chrysorrhoas (&quot;golden stream&quot;) of the Greeks, the modern Nahr Barada (the &quot;cold&quot;), which rises in the Anti-Lebanon, one of its sources, the Ain Barada, being near the village of Zebedani, and flows in a southerly and then southeasterly direction toward Damascus. A few miles southeast of Suk Wady Barada (the ancient Abila; see ABILENE) the volume of the stream is more than doubled by a torrent of clear, cold water from the beautifully situated spring `Ain Fijeh (Greek pege, &quot;fountain&quot;), after which it flows through a picturesque gorge till it reaches Damascus, whose many fountains and gardens it supplies liberally with water. In the neighborhood of Damascus a number of streams branch off from the parent river, and spread out like an opening fan on the surrounding plain. The Barada, along with the streams which it feeds, loses itself in the marshes of the Meadow Lakes about 18 miles East of the city.The water of the Barada, though not perfectly wholesome in the city itself, is for the most part clear and cool; its course is picturesque, and its value to Damascus, as the source alike of fertility and of charm, is inestimable.C.

It is the same stem that appears in the familiar phrase &quot;beyond Jordan,&quot; used to denote the region East of the Jordan, and Hellenized in the name Peraea. This fact affords the most natural explanation of the phrases `the mountains of the Abarim&#x27; (Nu 33:47,48); `this mountain-country of the Abarim&#x27; (Nu 27:12; De 32:49); Iye-abarim, which means &quot;Heaps of the Abarim,&quot; or &quot;Mounds of the Abarim&quot; (Nu 21:11; 33:44). In Nu 33:45 this station is called simply Iyim, &quot;Mounds.&quot; It is to be distinguished from the place of the same name in southern Judah (Jos 15:29). The name Abarim, without the article, occurs in Jer (Jer 22:20 the Revised Version (British and American), where the King James Version translates &quot;the passages&quot;), where it seems to be the name of a region, on the same footing with the names Lebanon and Bashan, doubtless the region referred to in Nu and Deuteronomy. There is no reason for changing the vowels in Eze 39:11, in order to make that another occurrence of the same name.When the people of Abraham lived in Canaan, before they went to Egypt to sojourn, they spoke of the region east of the Jordan as &quot;beyond Jordan.&quot; Looking across the Jordan and the Dead Sea they designated the mountain country they saw there as &quot;the Beyond mountains.&quot; They continued to use these geographical terms when they came out of Egypt. We have no means of knowing to how extensive a region they applied the name. The passages speak of the mountain country of Abarim where Moses died, including Nebo, as situated back from the river Jordan in its lowest reaches; and of the Mounds of the Abarim as farther to the southeast, so that the Israelites passed them when making their detour around the agricultural parts of Edom, before they crossed the Arnon. Whether the name Abarim should be applied to the parts of the eastern hill country farther to the north is a question on which we lack evidence.Willis J. Beecher</p>

The word is always employed to indicate what should be done to or by him who nurtures a spirit and exhibits a demeanor contrary to the laudable humility which is a natural fruit of religion. Such a person is warned that the most extravagant audacity will not daunt Yahweh nor abate His vengeance (Isa 31:4), and good men are exhorted to employ their powers to bring him low (Job 40:11; Eze 21:26).

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ab&#x27;-don (`abhdon, perhaps &quot;service&quot;; Abdon):(1) A judge of Israel for eight years (Jud 12:13-15). The account says that he was the son of Hillel the Pirathonite, and that he was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim. No mention is made of great public services rendered by him, but it is said that he had seventy well-mounted sons and grandsons. So far as we can judge, he was placed in office as a wealthy elderly man, and performed the routine duties acceptably. Very likely his two next predecessors Ibzan and Elon were men of the same type. An effort has been made to identify Abdon with the Bedan mentioned in 1Sa 12:11, but the identification is precarious.A certain importance attaches to Abdon from the fact that he is the last judge mentioned in the continuous account (Jud 2:6-13:1) in the Book of Jgs. After the account of him follows the statement that Israel was delivered into the hands of the Philistines forty years, and with that statement the continuous account closes and the series of personal stories begins--the stories of Samson, of Micah and his Levite, of the Benjamite civil war, followed in our English Bibles by the stories of Ru and of the childhood of Samuel. With the close of this last story (1Sa 4:18) the narrative of public affairs is resumed, at a point when Israel is making a desperate effort, at the close of the forty years of Eli, to throw off the Philistine yoke. A large part of one&#x27;s views of the history of the period of the Judges will depend on the way in which he combines these events. My own view is that the forty years of Jud 13:1 and of 1Sa 4:18 are the same; that at the death of Abdon the Philistines asserted themselves as overlords of Israel; that it was a part of their policy to suppress nationality in Israel; that they abolished the office of judge, and changed the high-priesthood to another family, making Eli high priest; that Eli was sufficiently competent so that many of the functions of national judge drifted into his hands. It should be noted that the regaining of independence was signalized by the reestablishment of the office of judge, with Samuel as incumbent (1Sa 7:6 and context). This view takes into the account that the narrative concerning Samson is detachable, like the narratives that follow, Samson belonging to an earlier period. See SAMSON.(2) The son of Jeiel and his wife Maacah (1Ch 8:30; 9:36). Jeiel is described as the &quot;father of Gibeon,&quot; perhaps the founder of the Israelirish community there. This Abdon is described as brother to Ner, the grandfather of King Saul.(3) One of the messengers sent by King Josiah to Huldah the prophetess (2Ch 34:20); called Achbor in 2Ki 22:12.(4) One of many men of Benjamin mentioned as dwelling in Jerusalem (1Ch 8:23), possibly in Nehemiah&#x27;s time, though the date is not clear.Willis J.

The name, according to this view, would mean &quot;servant of Nebo.&quot; Inasmuch as `abhedh is a translation of the Babylonian `arad, it seems ore probable that nego also must be a translation of some Babylonian word. The goddess Ishtar is by the Babylonians called &quot;the morning star&quot; and &quot;the perfect light&quot; (nigittu gitmaltu). The morning star is called by the Arameans nogah, &quot;the shining one,&quot; a word derived from the root negah, the equivalent of the Babylonian nagu, &quot;to shine.&quot; Abed-nego, according to this interpretation, would be the translation of Arad-Ishtar, a not uncommon name among the Assyrians and Babylonians. Canon Johns gives this as the name of more than thirty Assyrians, who are mentioned on the tablets cited by him in Vol. III of his great work entitled Assyrian Deeds and Documents. It means &quot;servant of Ishtar.&quot;Abed-nego was one of the three companions of Daniel, and was the name imposed upon the Hebrew Azariah by Nebuchadnezzar (Da 1:7). Having refused, along with his friends, to eat the provisions of the king&#x27;s table, he was fed and flourished upon pulse and water. Having successfully passed his examinations and escaped the death with which the wise men of Babylon were threatened, he was appointed at the request of Daniel along with his companions over the affairs of the province of Babylon (Da 2). Having refused to bow down to the image which Nebuehadnezzar had set up, he was cast into the burning fiery furnace, and after his triumphant delivery he was caused by the king to prosper in the province of Babylon (Da 3). The three friends are referred to by name in 1 Macc 2:59, and by implication in He 11:33,34.R. Dick Wilson</p>

Some translation &quot;a breath,&quot; &quot;vapor,&quot; &quot;transitoriness,&quot; which are suggestive of his brief existence and tragic end; others take it to be a variant of Jabal, yabhal, &quot;shepherd&quot; or &quot;herdman,&quot; Ge 4:20. Compare Assyrian ablu and Babylonian abil, &quot;son&quot;): The second son of Adam and Eve. The absence of the verb harah (Ge 4:2; compare Ge 4:1) has been taken to imply, perhaps truly, that Cain and Abel were twins.1. A Shepherd:&quot;Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground,&quot; thus representing the two fundamental pursuits of civilized life, the two earliest subdivisions of the human race. On the Hebrew tradition of the superiority of the pastoral over agricultural and city life, see The Expositor T, V, 351 ff. The narrative may possibly bear witness to the primitive idea that pastoral life was more pleasing to Yahweh than husbandry.2. A Worshipper:&quot;In process of time,&quot; the two brothers came in a solemn manner to sacrifice unto Yahweh, in order to express their gratitude to Him whose tenants they were in the land (Ge 4:3,4. See SACRIFICE).How Yahweh signified His acceptance of the one offering and rejection of the other, we are not told. That it was due to the difference in the material of the sacrifice or in their manner of offering was probably the belief among the early Israelites, who regarded animal offerings as superior to cereal offerings. Both kinds, however, were fully in accord with Hebrew law and custom. It has been suggested that the Septuagint rendering of Ge 4:7 makes Cain&#x27;s offense a ritual one, the offering not being &quot;correctly&quot; made or rightly divided, and hence rejected as irregular. &quot;If thou makest a proper offering, but dost not cut in pieces rightly, art thou not in fault? Be still!&quot; The Septuagint evidently took the rebuke to turn upon Cain&#x27;s neglect to prepare his offering according to strict ceremonial requirements. dieles (Septuagint in the place cited.), however, implies nathach (nattach), and would only apply to animal sacrifices. Compare Ex 29:17; Le 8:20; Jud 19:29; 1Ki 18:23; and see COUCH.3. A Righteous Man:The true reason for the Divine preference is doubtless to be found in the disposition of the brothers (see CAIN). Well-doing consisted not in the outward offering (Ge 4:7) but in the right state of mind and feeling. The acceptability depends on the inner motives and moral characters of the offerers. &quot;By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent (abundant, pleiona) sacrifice than Cain&quot; (Heb 11:4). The &quot;more abundant sacrifice,&quot; Westcott thinks, &quot;suggests the deeper gratitude of Abel, and shows a fuller sense of the claims of God&quot; to the best. Cain&#x27;s &quot;works (the collective expression of his inner life) were evil, and his brother&#x27;s righteous&quot; (1Joh 3:12). &quot;It would be an outrage if the gods looked to gifts and sacrifices and not to the soul&quot; (Alcibiades II.149E.150A).

In 2Sa 20:15 (Hebrew) it is Abel-beth-hammaacah (Maacah with the article). In 20:14 it appears as Beth-maacah, and in 20:14 and 18 as Abel.In 2Sa it is spoken of as the city, far to the north, where Joab besieged Sheba, the son of Bichri. In 2Ki it is mentioned, along with Ijon and other places, as a city in Naphtali captured by Tiglathpileser, king of Assyria. The capture appears also in the records of Tiglath-pileser. In 1Ki it is mentioned with Ijon and Da and &quot;all the land of Naphtali&quot; as being smitten by Benhadad of Damascus in the time of Baasha. In the account in Chronicles parallel to this last (2Ch 16:4) the cities mentioned are Ijon, Dan, Abel- maim. Abel-maim is either another name for Abel-beth-maacah, or the name of another place in the same vicinity.The prevailing identification of Abel-beth-maacah is with Abil, a few miles West of Dan, on a height overlooking the Jordan near its sources.

When Gideon and his 300 broke their pitchers in the camp of Midian, the Midianites in their first panic fled down the valley of Jezreel and the Jordan &quot;toward Zererah&quot; (Jud 7:22). Zererah (Zeredah) is Zarethan (2Ch 4:17; compare 1Ki 7:46), separated from Succoth by the clay ground where Solomon made castings for the temple. The wing of the Midianites whom Gideon pursued crossed the Jordan at Succoth (Jud 8:4 ff). This would indicate that Abel-meholah was thought of as a tract of country with a &quot;border,&quot; West of the Jordan, some miles South of Beth-shean, in the territory either of Issachar or West Manasseh.Abel-meholah is also mentioned in connection with the jurisdiction of Baana, one of Solomon&#x27;s twelve commissary officers (1Ki 4:12) as below Jezreel, with Beth-shean and Zarethan in the same list. Jerome and Eusebius speak of Abel-meholah as a tract of country and a town in the Jordan valley, about ten Roman miles South of Beth-shean. At just that point the name seems to be perpetuated in that of the Wady Malib, and Abel-meholah is commonly located near where that Wady, or the neighboring Wady Helweh, comes down into the Jordan valley.Presumably Adriel the Meholathite (1Sa 18:19; 2Sa 21:8) was a resident of Abel-meholah.

The name is a pun. The Canaanite residents saw the &#x27;ebhel, &quot;the mourning,&quot; and therefore that place was called &#x27;abhel mitsrayim.It is remarkable that the funeral should have taken this circuitous route, instead of going directly from Egypt to Hebron. Possibly a reason may be found as we obtain additional details in Egyptian history. The explanations which consist in changing the text, or in substituting the North Arabian Mutsri for Mitsrayim, are unsatisfactory. Willis J. Beecher</p>

The name always has the article, and the best expression of it in English would be &quot;the Acacias.&quot; `The valley of the Acacias&#x27; (Joe 3:18 (4:18)) is, apparently, a different locality.For many weeks before crossing the Jordan, Israel was encamped in the vicinity of the Jordan valley, North of the Dead Sea, East of the river. The notices in the Bible, supplemented by those in Josephus and Eusebius and Jerome, indicate that the camping region was many miles in extent, the southern limit being Beth-jeshimoth, toward the Dead Sea, while Abel of the Acacias was the northern limit and the headquarters. The headquarters are often spoken of as East of the Jordan at Jericho (e.g. Nu 22:1; 26:3,63). During the stay there occurred the Balaam incident (Nu 22-24), and the harlotry with Moab and Midian (Nu 25) and the war with Midian (Nu 31), in both of which Phinehas distinguished himself. It was from the Acacias that Joshua sent out the spies, and that Israel afterward moved down to the river for the crossing. Micah aptly calls upon Yahweh&#x27;s people to remember all that happened to them from the time when they reached the Acacias to the time when Yahweh had brought them safely across the river to Gilgal.Josephus is correct in saying that Abel of the Acacias is the place from which the Deuteronomic law purports to have been given. In his time the name survived as Abila, a not very important town situated there. He says that it was &quot;sixty furlongs from Abila to the Jordan,&quot; that is a little more than seven English miles (Ant., IV, viii, 1 and V, i, 1; BJ, IV, vii, 6). There seems to be a consensus for locating the site at Kefrein, near where the wady of that name comes down into the Jordan valley.Willis J. Beecher</p>

A name common to several kings (toparchs) of Edessa, Mesopotamia. One of these, Abgar, a son of Uchomo, the seventeenth (14th?) of twenty kings, according to the legend (Historia Ecclesiastica, i.13) sent a letter to Jesus, professing belief in His Messiahship and asking Him to come and heal him from an incurable disease (leprosy?), inviting Him at the same time to take refuge from His enemies in his city, &quot;which is enough for us both.&quot; Jesus answering the letter blessed him, because he had believed on Him without having seen Him, and promised to send one of His disciples after He had risen from the dead.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a&#x27;-bi, in the composition of names (&#x27;abhi, &quot;father&quot;): The Hebrew words &#x27;abh, &quot;father,&quot; and &#x27;ach, &quot;brother,&quot; are used in the forming of names, both at the beginning and at the end of words, e.g. Abram (&quot;exalted one&quot;), Joah (&quot;Yahweh is brother&quot;), Ahab (&quot;father&#x27;s brother&quot;). At the beginning of a word, however, the modified forms &#x27;abhi and &#x27;achi are the ones commonly used, e.g. Ahimelech (&quot;king&#x27;s brother&quot;) and Abimelech (by the same analogy &quot;king&#x27;s father&quot;).These forms have characteristics which complicate the question of their use in proper names. Especially since the publication in 1896 of Studies in Hebrew Proper Names, by G. Buchanan Gray, the attention of scholars has been called to this matter, without the reaching of any perfect consensus of opinion.The word &#x27;abhi may be a nominative with an archaic ending (&quot;father&quot;), or in the construct state (&quot;father- of&quot;), or the form with the suffix (&quot;my father&quot;). Hence a proper name constructed with it may supposedly be either a clause or a sentence; if it is a sentence, either of the two words may be either subject or predicate. That is to say, the name Abimelech may supposedly mean either &quot;father of a king,&quot; or &quot;a king is father,&quot; or &quot;a father is king,&quot; or &quot;my father is king,&quot; or &quot;a king is my father.&quot; Further, the clause &quot;father of a king&quot; may have as many variations of meaning as there are varieties of the grammatical genitive. Further still, it is claimed that either the word father or the word king may, in a name, be a designation of a deity. This gives a very large number of supposable meanings from which, in any case, to select the intended meaning.The older scholarship regarded all these names as construct clauses. For example, Abidan is &quot;father of a judge.&quot; It explained different instances as being different varieties of the genitive construction; for instance, Abihail, &quot;father of might,&quot; means mighty father. The woman&#x27;s name Abigail, &quot;father of exultation,&quot; denotes one whose father is exultant. Abishai, &quot;father of Jesse,&quot; denotes one to whom Jesse is father, and so with Abihud, &quot;father of Judah,&quot; Abiel, &quot;father of God,&quot; Abijah, &quot;father of Yahweh.&quot; See the cases in detail in Gesenius&#x27; Lexicon.The more recent scholarship regards most or all of the instances as sentences. In some cases it regards the second element in a name as a verb or adjective instead of a noun; but that is not important, inasmuch as in Hebrew the genitive construction might persist, even with the verb or adjective. But in the five instances last given the explanation, &quot;my father is exultation,&quot; &quot;is Jesse,&quot; &quot;is Judah,&quot; &quot;is God,&quot; &quot;is Yahweh,&quot; certainly gives the meaning in a more natural way than by explaining these names as construct clauses.There is sharp conflict over the question whether we ought to regard the suffix pronoun as present in these names--whether the five instances should not rather be translated Yahweh is father, God is father, Judah is father, Jesse is father, exultation is father. The question is raised whet...</p>

In Chronicles the name is &#x27;ebh-yacaph, which seems to be a mere variant spelling. The Samaritan version has the same form in Exodus. The list in Exodus terminates with Abiasaph, who is to be regarded as the contemporary of Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron. The two lists in 1Ch 6 lead up to the prophet Samuel and the singing companies which David is said to have organized. The list in 1Ch 9 leads up to the Korahite porters of the time of Nehemiah. Apparently all the lists intentionally omit names, just names enough being given in each to indicate the line. Willis J. Beecher</p>

The pious Abiathar was still conscious that he had a Father, even after the butchery of his human relatives):1. The Biblical Account:The Scriptures represent that Abiathar was descended from Phinehas the son of Eli, and through him from Ithamar the son of Aaron; that he was the son of Ahimelech the head priest at Nob who, with his associates, was put to death by King Saul for alleged conspiracy with David; that he had two sons, Ahimelech and Jonathan, the former of whom was, in Abiathar&#x27;s lifetime, prominent in the priestly service (1Sa 21:1-9; 22:7 ff; 2Sa 8:17; 15:27 ff; 1Ch 18:16; 24:3,6,31).See AHIMELECH; AHITUB.Abiathar escaped from the massacre of the priests at Nob, and fled to David, carrying the ephod with him. This was a great accession to David&#x27;s strength. Public feeling in Israel was outraged by the slaughter of the priests, and turned strongly against Saul. The heir of the priesthood, and in his care the holy ephod, were now with David, and the fact gave to his cause prestige, and a certain character of legitimacy. David also felt bitterly his having been the unwilling cause of the death of Abiathar&#x27;s relatives, and this made his heart warm toward his friend. Presumably, also, there was a deep religious sympathy between them.Abiathar seems to have been at once recognized as David&#x27;s priest, the medium of consultation with Yahweh through the ephod (1Sa 22:20-23; 23:6,9; 30:7,8). He was at the head of the priesthood, along with Zadok (1Ch 15:11), when David, after his conquests (1Ch 13:5; compare 2Sa 6), brought the ark to Jerusalem. The two men are mentioned together as high priests eight times in the narrative of the rebellion of Absalom (2Sa 15:24 ff), and are so mentioned in the last list of David&#x27;s heads of departments (2Sa 20:25). Abiathar joined with Adonijah in his attempt to seize the throne (1Ki 1:7-42), and was for this deposed from the priesthood, though he was treated with consideration on account of his early comradeship with David (1Ki 2:26,27). Possibly he remained high priest emeritus, as Zadok and Abiathar still appear as priests in the lists of the heads of departments for Solomon&#x27;s reign (1Ki 4:4). Particularly apt is the passage in Ps 55:12-14, if one regards it as referring to the relations of David and Abiathar in the time of Adonijah.There are two additional facts which, in view of the close relations between David and Abiathar, must be regarded as significant. One is that Zadok, Abiathar&#x27;s junior, is uniformly mentioned first, in all the many passages in which the two are mentioned together, and is treated as the one who is especially responsible. Turn to the narrative, and see how marked this is. The other similarly significant fact is that in c...</p>

The year thus indicated was practically the same with the old Babylonian year, and presumably came in with Abraham. The Pentateuchal laws do not introduce it, though they define it, perhaps to distinguish it from the Egyptian wandering year.See CALENDAR.Willis J. Beecher</p>

As he was great uncle to Zelophehad&#x27;s daughters, who brought a case before Moses (Nu 36), he must have been an old man at the time of the conquest. He was the son of Gilead the son of Machir, in the sense of being a more remote descendant, for Machir had sons before the death of Joseph (Ge 50:23). The Machir that possessed Gilead and Bashan because he was &quot;a man of war&quot; was the Manassite family of Machir, with Jair as its great general (Jos 17:1; 13:30,31, Nu 32:39-41, De 3:12-15). To Abiezer and other sons of Gilead territory was assigned West of the Jordan.In later generations the name survived as that of the family to which Gideon belonged, and perhaps also of the region which they occupied (Jud 6:34; 8:2). They are also called Abiezrites (Jud 6:11,24, 8:32). The region was West of Shechem, with Ophrah for its principal city.(2) One of David&#x27;s mighty men, &quot;the Anathothite&quot; (2Sa 23:27; 1Ch 11:28), who was also one of David s month-by-month captains, his month being the ninth (1Ch 27:12).Willis J.

Nabal grazed his flocks in or along the Southern Wilderness, where David and his men protected them from marauding tribes, so that not a sheep was lost. When Nabal was sheep-shearing and feasting at Carmel (in Judea), David sent messengers requesting provisions for himself and men. But Nabal, who was a churlish fellow, answered the messengers insultingly and sent them away empty-handed. David, angered by such mean ingratitude, gathered his 400 warriors and set out to destroy Nabal and all he had (1Sa 25:22). Meanwhile Abigail, a woman &quot;of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance&quot; (1Sa 25:3), heard of the rebuff given the men of David by her husband; and fearing what vengeance David in his wrath might work, she gathered a considerable present of food (1Sa 25:18), and hastened to meet the approaching soldiers. Her beautiful and prudent words, as also her fair face, so won David that he desisted from his vengeful purpose and accepted her gift (1Sa 25:32-35). When Abigail told Nabal of his narrow escape, he was stricken with fear, and died ten days afterward. Shortly after this David took Abigail to be his wife, although about the same time, probably a little before, he had also taken Ahinoam (1Sa 25:43); and these two were with him in Gath (1Sa 27:3). After David became king in Hebron, Abigail bore him his second son, Chileab (2Sa 3:3) or Daniel, as he is called in 1Ch 3:1.(2) Sister of David and mother of Amasa, at one time commander of David&#x27;s army (1Ch 2:16,17; Abigal 2Sa 17:25). In the first passage she is called David&#x27;s sister, along with Zeruiah; while in the second she is called the &quot;daughter of Nahash.&quot; Several explanations of this connection with Nahash have been suggested, any one of which would be sufficient to remove contradiction:(1) That Nahash was another name of Jesse, as in Isa 14:29, mish-shoresh nachash yetse&#x27; (Qimchi);(2) That Nahash was the wife of Jesse and by him mother of Abigail, which is least probable;(3) That Nahash, the father of Abigail and Zeruiah, having died, his widow became the wife of Jesse, and bore sons to him;(4) That the text of 2Sa 17:25 has been corrupted, &quot;daughter of Nahash&quot; having crept into the text. At all events she was the sister of David by the same mother.Edward Mack</p>

This being true, she was the wife of Jerimath, a son of David, and daughter of Eliab, David&#x27;s eldest brother. It is interesting to note this frequent intermarriage in the Davidic house;(5) Father of Queen Esther, who became wife of Xerxes (Biblical Ahasuerus) king of Persia, after the removal of the former queen, Vashti, (Es 2:15; 9:29).

Compare &quot;Zacharias of the course of Abijah&quot; (Lu 1:5).(4) A son of Jeroboam I of Israel (1Ki 14:1-18). The narrative describes his sickness and his mother&#x27;s visit to the prophet Ahijah. He is spoken of as the one member of the house of Jeroboam in whom there was &quot;found some good thing toward Yahweh.&quot; With his death the hope of the dynasty perished.(5) The son and successor of Rehoboam king of Judah (1Ch 3:10; 2Ch 11:20-14:1). As to the variant name Abijam (1Ki 14:31; 15:1,7,8) see ABIJAM.The statements concerning Abijah&#x27;s mother afford great opportunity for a person who is interested in finding discrepancies in the Bible narrative. She is said to have been Maacah the daughter of Absalom (1Ki 15:2; 2Ch 11:20,21,22). As more than 50 years elapsed between the adolescence of Absalom and the accession of Rehoboam, the suggestion at once emerges that she may have been Absalom&#x27;s daughter in the sense of being his granddaughter. But Maacha the daughter of Absalom was the mother of Asa, Abijam&#x27;s son and successor (1Ki 15:10,13; 2Ch 15:16). Further we are explicitly told that Absalom had three sons and one daughter (2Sa 14:27). It is inferred that the three sons died young, inasmuch as Absalom before his death built him a monument because he had no son (2Sa 18:18). The daughter was distinguished for her beauty, but her name was Tamar, not Maacah. Finally, the narrative tells us that the name of Abijah&#x27;s mother was &quot;Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah&quot; (2Ch 13:2).It is less difficult to combine all these statements into a consistent account than it would be to combine some pairs of them if taken by themselves. When all put together they make a luminous narrative, needing no help from conjectural theories of discrepant sources or textual errors. It is natural to understand that Tamar the daughter of Absalom married Uriel of Gibeah; that their daughter was Maacah, named for her great-grandmother (2Sa 3:3; 1Ch 3:2); that Micaiah is a variant of Maacah, as Abijah is of Abijam. Maacah married Rehoboam, the parties being second cousins on the father&#x27;s side; if they had been first cousins perhaps they would not have married. Very likely Solomon, through the marriage, hoped to conciliate an influential party in Israel which still held the name of Absalom in esteem; perhaps also he hoped to supplement the moderate abilities of Rehoboam by the great abilities of his wife. She was a brilliant woman, and Rehoboam&#x27;s favorite (2Ch 11:21). On Abijah&#x27;s accession she held at court the influential position of king&#x27;s mother; and she was so strong that she...</p>

The name given in Kings (1Ki 14:31; 15:1,7,8) to the son of Rehoboam who succeeded him as king of Judah. See ABIJAH.The name has puzzled scholars. Some have proposed, by adding one letter, to change it into &quot;father of his people.&quot; Others have observed that the Greek rendering in Kings is Abeiou. Either the Hebrew copy used by the Greek translator read &#x27;abhiyahu, Abijah, or else the translator substituted the form of the name which was to him more familiar. A few existing copies of the Hebrew have the reading Abijah, and Mt 1:7 presupposes that as the Old Testament reading. So they infer that Abijam in Ki is an erroneous reading for Abijah. This seems at present to be the prevailing view, and it is plausible. It would be more convincing, however, if the name occurred but once in the passage in Kings, instead of occurring five times. It is improbable that a scribe would repeat the same error five times within a few sentences, while a translator, if he changed the name once, would of course change it the other four times.Exploration has revealed the fact that the whole region near the eastern end of the Mediterranean was known as &quot;the west.&quot; &quot;Father of the west&quot; is not an inapt name for Rehoboam to give to the boy who, he expects, will inherit the kingdom of Solomon and David. The effect of the secession of the ten tribes was to make that name a burlesque, and one does not wonder that it was superseded by Abijah, &quot;My father is Yahweh.&quot;Willis J. Beecher</p>

The district derived its name from Abila, its chief town, which was situated, according to the Itinerarium Antonini, 18 Roman miles from Damascus on the way to Heliopolis (Baalbec). This places it in the neighborhood of the village of Suk Wady Barada (see ABANAH), near which there are considerable ancient remains, with an inscription in Greek stating that a &quot;freedman of Lysanias the tetrarch&quot; made wall and built a temple, and another in Latin recording the repair of the road &quot;at the expense of the Abilenians.&quot; The memory of the ancient name probably survives in the Moslem legend which places the tomb of Abel in a neighboring height where there are ruins of a temple. Josephus calls this Abila, he Lusaniou, literally, &quot;the Abilene of Lysanius,&quot; thus distinguishing it from other towns of the same name, and as late as the time of Ptolemy (circa 170 AD) the name of Lysanias was associated with it.The territory of Abilene was part of the Iturean Kingdom, which was broken up when its king, Lysanias, was put to death by M. Antonius, circa 35 BC. The circumstances in which Abilene became distinct tetrarchy are altogether obscure, and nothing further is known of the tetrarch Lysanias (Ant., XIX, v, 1; XX, ii, 1). In 37 AD the tetrarchy, along with other territories, was granted to Agrippa I, after whose death in 44 AD it was administered by procurators until 53 AD, when Claudius conferred it again, along with neighboring territories, upon Agrippa II. On Agrippa&#x27;s death, toward the close of the 1st century, his kingdom was incorporated in the province of Syria. See LYSANIAS.C. H. Thomson</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-bim&#x27;-e-lek (&#x27;abhimelekh, &quot;father of a king&quot;): A name borne by five Old Testament persons.(1) The name of two kings of Philistia; the first was a contemporary of Abraham, the second, probably son of the former, was king in the days of Isaac. It is quite possible that Abimelech was the royal title rather than the personal name, since in the title of Ps 34 we find it applied to the king of Gath, elsewhere known by his personal name, Achish (1Sa 27:2,3). Shortly after the destruction of Sodom Abraham journeyed with his herds and flocks into the extreme Southeast country of Palestine (Ge 20). While sojourning at Gerar, the city of Abimelech, king of the Philistine country, he made believe that Sarah was his sister (Ge 20:2), and Abimelech took her, intending to make her one of his wives. But God rebuked him in a dream, besides sending barrenness on the women of his household (Ge 20:3,17). After Abimelech had reproved Abraham most justly for the deception, he dealt generously with him, loading him with presents and granting him the liberty of the land (Ge 20:14,15). When contention had arisen between the servants of the two men over the wells of water the two men made a covenant at a well, which took its name, Beersheba, from this fact of covenantmaking (Ge 21:31,32).(2) Nearly a century later than the events connected with the first Abimelech, as outlined above, a second Abimelech, king of the Philistines, is mentioned in relations with Isaac (Ge 26), who in time of grievous famine went down from his home, probably at Hebron, to Gerar. Fearing for his life because of his beautiful wife, Rebekah, he called her his sister, just as Abraham had done with reference to Sarah. Neither Abimelech nor any of his people took Rebekah to wife--quite a variation from the Abrahamic incident; but when the falsehood was detected, he upbraided Isaac for what might have happened, continuing nevertheless to treat him most graciously. Isaac continued to dwell in the vicinity of Gerar, until contention between his herdsmen and those of Abimelech became too violent; then he moved away by stages, reopening the wells digged (dug) by his father (Ge 26:18-22). Finally, a covenant was made between Abimelech and Isaac at Beersheba, just ,as had been made between Abraham and the first Abimelech (Ge 26:26-33). The two kings of Philistia were probably father and son.(3) The title of Ps 34 mentions another Abimelech, who in all probability is the same as Achish king of Gath (1Sa 21:10-22:1); with whom David sought refuge when fleeing from Saul, and with whom he was dwelling at the time of the Philistine invasion of Israel, which cost Saul his kingdom and his life (1Sa 27). It appears from this that Abimelech was the royal title, and not the personal name of the Philistine kings.(4) A son of Gideon (Jud 9) who aspired to be king after the death of his father, and did rule three years (Jud 9:22). He first won the support of the members of his mother&#x27;s family and their recommendation ...</p>

To account for the ambiguity note that gibh`ah means hill, and that the place-name Gibeah ordinarily has the definite article. It is natural to think that Abinadab was himself a man of Kiriath-jearim, though the account does not explicitly say so. The record is that the men of Kiriath-jearim were summoned to take charge of the ark at a time when no one else dared to have it (1Sa 6:20,21); and the implication seems to be that they had no option to refuse. Possibly this was due to their being Gibeonites, and hereditary &quot;bondmen&quot; of &quot;the house of my God&quot; (Jos 9:17,23). However this may be, they &quot;sanctified&quot; Abinadab&#x27;s son Eleazar to have charge of the ark. According to the Hebrew and some of the Greek copies, the ark was in Gibeah in the middle of the reign of King Saul (1Sa 14:18).About a century later, according to the Bible numbers, David went with great pomp to Kiriath-jearim, otherwise known as Baalah or Baale-judah, to bring the ark from Kiriath-jearim, out of the house of Abinadab in the hill (or, in Gibeah), and place it in Jerusalem (1Ch 13; 2Sa 6). The new cart was driven by two descendants of Abinadab. There may or may not have been another Abinadab then living, the head of the house.(2) The second of the eight sons of Jesse, one of the three who were in Saul&#x27;s army when Goliath gave his challenge (1Sa 16:8; 17:13; 1Ch 2:13).(3) One of the sons of King Saul (1Ch 8:33; 9:39; 10:2; 1Sa 31:2). He died in the battle of Gilboa, along with his father and brothers.(4) In 1Ki 4:11 the King James Version has &quot;the son of Abinadab,&quot; where the Revised Version (British and American) has BEN-ABINADAB, which see.Willis J.

In company with his brother Dathan and Korah the Levite and others, he disputed the authority of Moses and Aaron in the wilderness (Nu 16-17; 26; De 11:6; Ps 106:17). Two hundred and fifty followers of Korah perished by fire at the doorway of the tent of meeting. Dathan and Abiram refused to come to the tent of meeting, at the summons of Moses; and the earth opened where their tents were, and swallowed them and their families and their goods. See KORAH.(2) The firstborn son of Hiel the Bethelite, who rebuilt Jericho in the time of Ahab (1Ki 16:34; compare Jos 6:26). This incident has recently acquired a new interest owing to discoveries made at Gezer and Megiddo concerning foundation sacrifices as in ancient times offered in Palestine. One should not be too positive in making statements concerning this, but the following is a possible interpretation of the record. The curse pronounced by Joshua on the man who should rebuild Jericho was of a piece with the other details, Jericho being treated exceptionally, as a city placed under the ban. The language of Joshua&#x27;s curse is capable of being translated: `Cursed be the man before Yahweh who shall .... build .... Jericho; (who) shall lay its foundation in his firstborn, and set up its gates in his youngest.&#x27; According to this interpretation the death of the builder&#x27;s eldest and youngest sons is not spoken of as the penalty involved in the curse, but as an existing horrible custom, mentioned in order to give solemnity to the diction of the curse. The writer in Kings cites the language of the curse by Joshua. The context in which he mentions the affair suggests that he regards Hiel&#x27;s conduct as exceptionally flagrant in its wickedness. Hiel, in defiance of Yahweh, not only built the city, but in building it revived the horrible old Canaanite custom, making his first-born son a foundation sacrifice, and his youngest son a sacrifice at the completion of the work.Willis J.

She was chosen for the service with great care on account of her youth and beauty and physical vigor. She ministered to the king, that is, waited on him as personal attendant and nurse. She also &quot;cherished&quot; him in his feebleness--gave to him through physical contact the advantage of her superabundant vitality. This was a mode of medical treatment recommended by the servants of the king, and it appears to have been not wholly unsuccessful. She had an intimate knowledge of the condition of David, and was present at the interview of Bathsheba with David which resulted in the placing of Solomon on the throne. If that act had been questioned she would have been a most important witness. By reason of this and of her personal charms, she might become a strong helper to any rival of Solomon who should intrigue to supplant him. Adonijah sought Abishag in marriage. On the basis of this and of such other evidence as may supposably have been in his possession, Solomon put Adonijah to death as an intriguer.Willis J. Beecher</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ab&#x27;-i-shi, a-bi&#x27;-shi (&#x27;abhishai, in Ch &#x27;abhshai; meaning is doubtful, probably &quot;my father is Jesse,&quot; BDB): Son of Zeruiah, David&#x27;s sister, and one of the three famous brothers, of whom Joab and Asahel were the other two (2Sa 2:18). He was chief of the second group of three among David&#x27;s &quot;mighty men&quot; (2Sa 23:18).He first appears with David, who was in the Wilderness of Ziph, to escape Saul. When David called for a volunteer to go down into Saul&#x27;s camp by night, Abishai responded, and counseled the killing of Saul when they came upon the sleeping king (1Sa 26:6-9). In the skirmish between the men of Ishbosheth and the men of David at Gibeon, in which Asahel was killed by Abner, Abishai was present (2Sa 2:18,24). He was with and aided Joab in the cruel and indefensible murder of Abner, in revenge for their brother Asahel (2Sa 3:30).In David&#x27;s campaign against the allied Ammonites and Syrians, Abishai led the attack upon the Ammonites, while Joab met the Syrians; the battle was a great victory for Israel (2Sa 10:10-14). He was always faithful to David, and remained with him, as he fled from Absalom. When Shimei, of the house of Saul, cursed the fleeing king, Abishai characteristically wished to kill him at once (2Sa 16:8,9); and when the king returned victorious Abishai advised the rejection of Shimei&#x27;s penitence, and his immediate execution (2Sa 19:21).In the battle with Absalom&#x27;s army at Mahanaim Abishai led one division of David&#x27;s army, Joab and Ittai commanding the other two (2Sa 18:2). With Joab he put down the revolt against David of Sheba, a man of Benjamin (2Sa 20:6,10), at which Joab treacherously slew Amasa his cousin and rival, as he had likewise murdered Abner, Abishai no doubt being party to the crime. In a battle with the Philistines late in his life, David was faint, being now an old man, and was in danger of death at the hands of the Philistine giant Ishbihenob when Abishai came to his rescue and killed the giant (2Sa 21:17). In the list of David&#x27;s heroes (2Sa 23) Abishai&#x27;s right to leadership of the &quot;second three&quot; is based upon his overthrowing three hundred men with his spear (2Sa 23:18). He does not appear in the struggle of Adonijah against Solomon, in which Joab was the leader, and therefore is supposed to have died before that time.He was an impetuous, courageous man, but less cunning than his more famous brother Joab, although just as cruel and relentless toward rival or foe. David understood and feared their hardness and cruelty. Abishai&#x27;s best trait was his unswerving loyalty to his kinsman, David.Edward Mack</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ab-lu&#x27;-shun: The rite of ablution for religious purification seems to have been practiced in some form in all lands and at all times. The priests of Egypt punctiliously practiced it (Herodotus ii.37). The Greeks were warned &quot;never with unwashed hands to pour out the black wine at morn to Zeus&quot; (Hesiod, Opera et Dies v.722; compare Homer, Iliad vi.266; Od. iv.759). The Romans also observed it (Virgil, Aeneid ii.217); as did and do Orientals in general (compare Koran, Sura 5:8, etc.). Ablutions for actual or ritual purification form quite a feature of the Jewish life and ceremonial. No one was allowed to enter a holy place or to approach God by prayer or sacrifice without having first performed the rite of ablution, or &quot;sanctification,&quot; as it was sometimes called (Ex 19:10; 1Sa 16:5; 2Ch 29:5; compare Josephus, Ant, XIV, xi, 5).Three kinds of washing are recognized in Biblical and rabbinical law:(1) washing of the hands,(2) washing of the hands and feet, and(3) immersion of the whole body in water. (1 and 2 = Greek nipto; 3 = Greek louo).Something more than an echo of a universal practice is found in the Scriptures. The rabbis claimed to find support for ceremonial hand-washing in Le 15:11. David&#x27;s words, &quot;I will wash my hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O Yahweh&quot; (Ps 26:6; compare Ps 73:13), are regarded by them as warranting the inference that ablution of the hands was prerequisite to any holy act. This is the form of ablution, accordingly, which is most universally and scrupulously practiced by Jews. Before any meal of which bread forms a part, as before prayer, or any act of worship, the hands must be solemnly washed in pure water; as also after any unclean bodily function, or contact with any unclean thing. Such handwashings probably arose naturally from the fact that the ancients ate with their fingers, and so were first for physical cleansing only; but they came to be ceremonial and singularly binding. The Talmud abundantly shows that eating with unwashed hands came to be reckoned a matter of highest importance-- &quot;tantamount to committing an act of unchastity, or other gross crime.&quot; Akiba, when in prison, went without water given him to quench his thirst, rather than neglect the rite of ablution (`Er. 216). Only in extreme cases, according to the Mishna, as on a battlefield, might people dispense with it. Simeon, the Essene, &quot;the Saint&quot; (Toseph. Kelim i.6), on entering the holy place without having washed his hands, claiming that he was holier than the high priest because of his ascetic life, was excommunicated, as undermining the authority of the Elders (compare `Eduy. 5 6).Washing of the hands and feet is prescribed by the Law only for those about to perform priestly functions (compare Koran, Sura 5 8, in contrast: &quot;When ye prepare yourselves for prayer, wash your faces and hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads and your feet to the ankles&quot;; Hughes, Dict. of Islam). For example, whenever Moses or Aaron or any subordin...</p>

He was Saul&#x27;s cousin; Ner the father of Abner and Kish the father of Saul being brothers, the sons of Abiel (1Sa 14:50 f). In 1Ch 8:33; 9:39 the text appears to be faulty; read: And Ner begat Abner, and Kish begat Saul. According to 1Ch 27:21 Abner had a son by the name of Jaasiel. Abner was to Saul what Joab was to David. Despite the many wars waged by Saul, we hear little of Abner during Saul&#x27;s lifetime. Not even in the account&#x27; of the battle of Gilboa is mention made of him. Yet both his high office and his kinship to the king must have brought the two men in close contact. On festive occasions it was the custom of Abner to sit at table by the king&#x27;s side (1Sa 20:25). It was Abner who introduced the young David fresh from his triumph over Goliath to the king&#x27;s court (so according to the account in 1Sa 17:57). We find Abner accompanying the king in his pursuit of David (1Sa 26:5 ff). Abner is rebuked by David for his negligence in keeping watch over his master (ibid., 15).Upon the death of Saul, Abner took up the cause of the young heir to the throne, Ishbosheth, whom he forthwith removed from the neighborhood of David to Mahanaim in the East-Jordanic country. There he proclaimed him king over all Israel. By the pool of Gibeon he and his men met Joab and the servants of David. Twelve men on each side engaged in combat which ended disastrously for Abner who fled. He was pursued by Asahel, Joab&#x27;s brother, whom Abner slew. Though Joab and his brother Abishai sought to avenge their brother&#x27;s death on the spot, a truce was effected; Abner was permitted to go his way after three hundred and threescore of his men had fallen. Joab naturally watched his opportunity. Abner and his master soon had a quarrel over Saul&#x27;s concubine, Rizpah, with whom Abner was intimate. It was certainly an act of treason which Ishbosheth was bound to resent. The disgruntled general made overtures to David; he won over the tribe of Benjamin. With twenty men of them he came to Hebron and arranged with the king of Judah that he would bring over to his side all Israel. He was scarcely gone when Joab learned of the affair; without the knowledge of David he recalled him to Hebron where he slew him, &quot;for the blood of Asahel his brother.&quot; David mourned sincerely the death of Abner. &quot;Know ye not,&quot; he addressed his servants, &quot;that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?&quot; He followed the bier in person. Of the royal lament over Abner a fragment is quoted:&quot;Should Abner die as a fool dieth? Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: As a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall.&quot;(See 2Sa 3:6-38.) The death of Abner, while it thus cannot in any wise be laid at the door of David, nevertheless served his purposes well. The backbo...</p>

Christ has taken out of it its sting (1Co 15:55 f) and all its hurtful power (Heb 2:14); has shown it to be under His control (Re 1:18), brought to light the incorruptible life beyond, and declared the ultimate destruction of death (1Co 15:26; compare Re 20:14). The Greek (katargeitai) indicates that the process of destruction was then going on.M. O. Evans</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-bom-i-na&#x27;-shun (piggul, to`ebhah, sheqets (shiqquts)): Three distinct Hebrew words are rendered in the English Bible by &quot;abomination,&quot; or &quot;abominable thing,&quot; referring (except in Ge 43:32; 46:34) to things or practices abhorrent to Yahweh, and opposed to the ritual or moral requirements of His religion. It would be well if these words could be distinguished in translation, as they denote different degrees of abhorrence or loathsomeness.The word most used for this idea by the Hebrews and indicating the highest degree of abomination is to`ebhah, meaning primarily that which offends the religious sense of a people. When it is said, for example, &quot;The Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians,&quot; this is the word used; the significance being that the Hebrews were repugnant to the Egyptians as foreigners, as of an inferior caste, and especially as shepherds (Ge 46:34). The feeling of the Egyptians for the Greeks was likewise one of repugnance. Herodotus (ii.41) says the Egyptians would not kiss a Greek on the mouth, or use his dish, or taste meat cut with the knife of a Greek.Among the objects described in the Old Testament as &quot;abominations&quot; in this sense are heathen gods, such as Ashtoreth (Astarte), Chemosh, Milcom, the &quot;abominations&quot; of the Zidonians (Phoenicians), Moabites, and Ammonites, respectively (2Ki 23:13), and everything connected with the worship of such gods. When Pharaoh, remonstrating against the departure of the children of Israel, exhorted them to offer sacrifices to their God in Egypt, Moses said: &quot;Shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians (i.e. the animals worshipped by them which were taboo, to`ebhah, to the Israelites) before their eyes, and will they not stone us?&quot; (Ex 8:26).It is to be noted that, not only the heathen idol itself, but anything offered to or associated with the idol, all the paraphernalia of the forbidden cult, was called an &quot;abomination,&quot; for it &quot;is an abomination to Yahweh thy God&quot; (De 7:25,26). The Deuteronomic writer here adds, in terms quite significant of the point of view and the spirit of the whole law: `Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thy house and thus become a thing set apart (cherem = tabooed) like unto it; thou shalt utterly detest it and utterly abhor it, for it is a thing set apart&#x27; (tabooed). To`ebhah is even used as synonymous with &quot;idol&quot; or heathen deity, as in Isa 44:19; De 32:16; 2Ki 23:13; and especially Ex 8:22 ff.Everything akin to magic or divination is likewise an abomination to`ebhah; as are sexual transgressions (De 22:5; 23:18; 24:4), especially incest and other unnatural offenses: &quot;For all these abominations have the men of the land done, that were before you&quot; (Le 18:27; compare Eze 8:15). It is to be noted, however, that the word takes on in the later usage a higher ethical and spiritual meaning: as where &quot;divers measures, a great and a small,&quot; are forbidden (De 25:14-16); and in Proverbs where &quot;lying lips&quot; (P...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">des-o-la&#x27;-shun: The Hebrew root for abomination is shaqats, &quot;to be filthy,&quot; &quot;to loathe,&quot; &quot;to abhor,&quot; from which is derived shiqquts, &quot;filthy,&quot; especially &quot;idolatrous.&quot; This word is used to describe specific forms of idolatrous worship that were specially abhorrent, as of the Ammonites (1Ki 11:5,7); of the Moabites (1Ki 11:7; 2Ki 23:13). When Daniel undertook to specify an abomination so surpassingly disgusting to the sense of morality and decency, and so aggressive against everything that was godly as to drive all from its presence and leave its abode desolate, he chose this as the strongest among the several synonyms, adding the qualification &quot;that maketh desolate&quot; (Da 11:31; 12:11), Septuagint bdel-ug-ma er-e-mo-se-os. The same noun, though in the plural, occurs in De 29:17; 2Ki 23:24; Isa 66:3; Jer 4:1; 7:30; 13:27; 32:34; Eze 20:7,8,30; Da 9:27; Ho 9:10; Zec 9:7. The New Testament equivalent of the noun is bdel-ug-ma = &quot;detestable,&quot; i.e. (specially) &quot;idolatrous.&quot; Alluding to Daniel, Christ spoke of the &quot;abomination of desolation&quot; (Mt 24:15; Mr 13:14).1. The Historical Background:Since the invasion of the Assyrians and Chaldeans, the Jewish people, both of the Northern and of the Southern kingdom, had been without political independence. From the Chaldeans the rulership of Judea had been transferred to the Persians, and from the Persians, after an interval of 200 years, to Alexander the Great. From the beginning of the Persian sovereignty, the Jews had been permitted to organize anew their religious and political commonwealth, thus establishing a state under the rulership of priests, for the high priest was not only the highest functionary of the cult, but also the chief magistrate in so far as these prerogatives were not exercised by the king of the conquering nation. Ezra had given a new significance to the Torah by having it read to the whole congregation of Israel and by his vigorous enforcement of the law of separation from the Gentiles. His emphasis of the law introduced the period of legalism and finical interpretation of the letter which called forth some of the bitterest invectives of our Saviour. Specialists of the law known as &quot;scribes&quot; devoted themselves to its study and subtle interpretation, and the pious beheld the highest moral accomplishment in the extremely conscientious observance of every precept. But in opposition to this class, there were those who, influenced by the Hellenistic culture, introduced by the conquests of Alexander the Great, were inclined to a more &quot;liberal&quot; policy. Thus, two opposing parties were developed: the Hellenistic, and the party of the Pious, or the Chasidim, chacidhim (Hasidaeans, 1 Macc 2:42; 7:13), who held fast to the strict ideal of the scribes. The former gradually came into ascendancy. Judea was rapidly becoming Hellenistic in all phases of its political, social and religious life, and the &quot;Pious&quot; were dwindling to a small minority sect. This was the situation when Antiochus Epiphanes set ou...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">Le 11:13-19: &quot;And these ye shall have in abomination among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the gier-eagle, and the osprey, and the kite, and the falcon after its kind, every raven after its kind, and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-mew, and the hawk after its kind, and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the vulture, and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.&quot; De 14:12-18 gives the glede in addition.Each of these birds is treated in order in this work. There are two reasons why Moses pronounced them an abomination for food. Either they had rank, offensive, tough flesh, or they were connected with religious superstition. The eagle, gier-eagle, osprey, kite, glede, falcon, raven, night-hawk, sea-mew, hawk, little owl, cormorant, great owl, horned owl, pelican and vulture were offensive because they were birds of prey or ate carrion or fish until their flesh partook of the odor of their food. Young ostriches have sweet, tender flesh and the eggs are edible also. In putting these birds among the abominations Moses must have been thinking of grown specimens. (Ostriches live to a remarkable age and on account of the distances they cover, and their speed in locomotion, their muscles become almost as hard as bone.)There is a trace of his early Egyptian training when he placed the stork and the heron on this list. These birds, and the crane as well, abounded in all countries known at that time and were used for food according to the superstitions of different nations. These three were closely related to the ibis which was sacred in Egypt and it is probable that they were protected by Moses for this reason, since they were eaten by other nations at that time and cranes are used for food today by natives of our southeastern coast states and are to be found in the markets of our western coast. The veneration for the stork that exists throughout the civilized world today had its origin in Palestine. Noting the devotion of mated pairs and their tender care for the young the Hebrews named the bird chacidhah, which means kindness. Carried down the history of ages with additions by other nations, this undoubtedly accounts for the story now universal, that the stork delivers newly-born children to their homes; so the bird is loved and protected.One ancient Roman writer, Cornelius Nepos, recorded that in his time both crane and storks were eaten; storks were liked the better. Later, Pliny wrote that no one would touch a stork, but everyone was fond of crane. In Thessaly it was a capital crime to kill a stork. This change from regarding the stork as a delicacy to its protection by a death penalty merely indicates the hold the characteristics of the bird had taken on people as it became better known, and also the spread of the regard in which it was held throughout Palestine. The hoopoe (which see) was offensive to Moses on ac...</p>

In the Old Testament they most frequently stand for some form of the stem rabh, signifying &quot;to cast together,&quot; &quot;to increase.&quot; In Pr 8:24 the primary idea is &quot;to be heavy&quot; (root: kabhadh); in De 33:19 and Job 22:11 it is &quot;to overflow&quot; shapha`; in Job 36:31 it is &quot;to plait together,&quot; &quot;to augment,&quot; &quot;to multiply&quot; (makhbir from ka- bhar); in Isa 47:9 it is &quot;strength&quot; `otsmah; in 1Ki 18:41 it is &quot;tumult,&quot; &quot;crowd&quot; hamon; in Ec 5:12 it is &quot;to fill to satiety&quot; (Revised Version (British and American) &quot;fulness&quot;); in Isa 15:7 it is &quot;excellence&quot; yithrah and in Isa 66:11 &quot;a full breast&quot; ziz; in Jer 33:6 it is &quot;copiousness&quot; (`athereth from `athar). In several passages (e.g. Eze 16:49; Ps 105:30; Isa 56:12) the Revised Version (British and American) gives other and better renderings than the King James Version. In the New Testament perissos, perisseuo, perisseia, etc., are the usual words for &quot;abundant,&quot; &quot;abound,&quot; &quot;abundance,&quot; etc. (the adjective signifies &quot;exceeding some number or measure&quot;). A slight formal difference of conception may be noted in pleonazo, which suggests that the abundance has resulted from augmentation. In Ro 5:20 the two words stand in the closest connection: `Where sin abounded (by its increase) grace abounded more exceedingly (was rich beyond measure).&#x27; In Mr 12:44; Lu 21:4; 2Co 8:20; 12:7; Re 18:3 the Revised Version (British and American) gives improved renderings instead of &quot;abundance,&quot; and in Titus 3:6 and 2Pe 1:11 instead of &quot;abundantly.&quot;J.

Two other persons are named &#x27;abhiram. The identity of this name with &#x27;abhram cannot be doubted in view of the variation between &#x27;abhiner and &#x27;abhner, &#x27;abhishalom and &#x27;abhshalom, etc. Abraham also appears in the list at Karnak of places conquered by Sheshonk I: &#x27;brm (no. 72) represents &#x27;abram, with which Spiegelberg (Aegypt. Randglossen zum Altes Testament, 14) proposes to connect the preceding name (so that the whole would read &quot;the field of Abram.&quot;) Outside of Palestine this name (Abiramu) has come to light just where from the Biblical tradition we should expect to find it, namely, in Babylonia (e.g. in a contract of the reign of Apil-Sin, second predecessor of Hammurabi; also for the aunt (!) of Esarhaddon 680-669 BC). Ungnad has recently found it, among documents from Dilbat dating from the Hammurabi dynasty, in the forms A-ba-am-ra-ma, A-ba-am-ra-am, as well as A-ba-ra-ma.2. Etymology:Until this latest discovery of the apparently full, historical form of the Babylonian equivalent, the best that could be done with the etymology was to make the first constituent &quot;father of&quot; (construct -i rather than suffix -i), and the second constituent &quot;Ram,&quot; a proper name or an abbreviation of a name. (Yet observe above its use in Assyria for a woman; compare ABISHAG; ABIGAIL). Some were inclined rather to concede that the second element was a mystery, like the second element in the majority of names beginning with &#x27;abh and &#x27;ach, &quot;father&quot; and &quot;brother.&quot; But the full cuneiform writing of the name, with the case-ending am, indicates that the noun &quot;father&quot; is in the accusative, governed by the verb which furnishes the second component, and that this verb therefore is probably ramu (= Hebrew racham) &quot;to love,&quot; etc.; so that the name would mean something like &quot;he loves the (his) father.&quot; (So Ungnad, also Ranke in Gressmann&#x27;s article &quot;Sage und Geschichte in den Patriarchenerzahlungen,&quot; ZATW (1910), 3.) Analogy proves that this is in the Babylonian fashion of the period, and that judging from the various writings of this and similar names, its pronunciation was not far from &#x27;abh-ram.3.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">booz&#x27;-um (kolpos Abraam; kolpoi Abraam): Figurative. The expression occurs in Lu 16:22,23, in the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus, to denote the place of repose to which Lazarus was carried after his death. The figure is suggested by the practice of the guest at a feast reclining on the breast of his neighbor. Thus, John leaned on the breast of Jesus at supper (Joh 21:20). The rabbis divided the state after death (Sheol) into a place for the righteous and a place for the wicked (see ESCHATOLOGY OF THE OLD TESTAMENT; SHEOL); but it is doubtful whether the figure of Jesus quite corresponds with this idea. &quot;Abraham&#x27;s bosom&quot; is not spoken of as in &quot;Hades,&quot; but rather as distinguished from it (Lu 16:23)--a place of blessedness by itself. There Abraham receives, as at a feast, the truly faithful, and admits them to closest intimacy. It may be regarded as equivalent to the &quot;Paradise&quot; of Lu 23:43.

It was the salutation which the Egyptians addressed to Joseph, when he was made second to Pharaoh, and appeared in his official chariot.(1) The explanations based upon Hebrew derivation are unsatisfactory, whether as the King James Version &quot;bow the knee,&quot; from barakh (hiphil imperative) or marginal &quot;tender father,&quot; or &quot;father of a king&quot; of the Targum. The form as Hiphil Imperative instead of habhrekh, is indefensible, while the other two derivations are fanciful.(2) The surmises of Egyptologists are almost without number, and none are conclusive. Skinner in his Commentary on Genesis selects &quot;attention!&quot; after Spiegelberg, as best. Speaker&#x27;s Commentary suggests &quot;rejoice thou&quot; from ab-nek. BDB gives preference to the Coptic a-bor-k, &quot;prostrate thyself.&quot;(3) The most satisfying parallel is the Assyrian abarakku, meaning &quot;grand vizier&quot; or &quot;friend of a king,&quot; as suggested by Fried.

A General Favorite:Absalom was born at Hebron (2Sa 3:3), and moved at an early age, with the transfer of the capital, to Jerusalem, where he spent most of his life. He was a great favorite of his father and of the people as well. His charming manners, his personal beauty, his insinuating ways, together with his love of pomp and royal pretensions, captivated the hearts of the people from the beginning. He lived in great style, drove in a magnificent chariot and had fifty men run before him. Such magnificence produced the desired effect upon the hearts of the young aristocrats of the royal city (2Sa 15:1 ff).2. In Exile:When Amnon, his half-brother, ravished his sister Tamar, and David shut his eyes to the grave crime and neglected to administer proper punishment, Absalom became justly enraged, and quietly nourished his anger, but after the lapse of two years carried out a successful plan to avenge his sister&#x27;s wrongs. He made a great feast for the king&#x27;s sons at Baalhazor, to which, among others, Amnon came, only to meet his death at the hands of Absalom&#x27;s servants (2Sa 13:1 ff). To avoid punishment he now fled to the court of his maternal grandfather in Geshur, where he remained three years, or until David, his father, had relented and condoned the murderous act of his impetuous, plotting son. At the end of three years (2Sa 13:38) we find Absalom once more in Jerusalem. It was, however, two years later before he was admitted to the royal presence (2Sa 14:28).3. Rebels against His Father:Absalom, again reinstated, lost no opportunity to regain lost prestige, and having his mind made up to succeed his father upon the throne, he forgot the son in the politician. Full of insinuations and rich in promises, especially to the disgruntled and to those having grievances, imaginary or real, it was but natural that he should have a following. His purpose was clear, namely, to alienate as many as possible from the king, and thus neutralize his influence in the selection of a successor, for he fully realized that the court party, under the influence of Bathsheba, was intent upon having Solomon as the next ruler. By much flattery Absalom stole the hearts of many men in Israel (2Sa 15:6). How long a period elapsed between his return from Geshur and his open rebellion against his father David is a question which cannot be answered with any degree of certainty. Most authorities regard the forty years of 2Sa 15:7 as an error and following the Syriac and some editions of the Septuagint, suggest four as the correct text. Whether forty or four, he obtained permission from the king to visit Hebron, the ancient capital, on pretense of paying a vow made by him while at Geshur in case of his safe return to Jerusalem. With two hundred men he repairs to Hebron. Previous to the feast ...</p>

The Roman church regards this as the act of a properly ordained priest, by which, in the sacrament of Penance, he frees from sin one who has confessed and made promise of satisfaction. Protestants regard the promise as given not to any order within the church, but to the congregation of believers, exercising its prerogative through the Christian ministry, as its ordinary executive. They differ as to whether the act be only declarative or collative. Luther regarded it as both declarative and collative, since the Word always brings that which it offers. The absolution differs from the general promise of the gospel by individualizing the promise. What the gospel, as read and preached, declares in general, the absolution applies personally.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">abs&#x27;-ti-nens: Abstinence as a form of asceticism reaches back into remote antiquity, and is found among most ancient peoples. It may be defined as a self-discipline which consists in the habitual renunciation, in whole or in part, of the enjoyments of the flesh, with a view to the cultivation of the life of the spirit. In its most extreme forms, it bids men to stifle and suppress their physical wants, rather than to subordinate them in the interest of a higher end or purpose, the underlying idea being that the body is the foe of the spirit, and that the progressive extirpation of the natural desires and inclinations by means of fasting, celibacy, voluntary poverty, etc., is &quot;the way of perfection.&quot;This article will be concerned chiefly with abstinence from food, as dealt with in the Bible. (For other aspects of the subject, see TEMPERANCE; CLEAN; UNCLEANNESS; MEAT, etc.). Thus limited, abstinence may be either public or private, partial or entire.1. Public Fasts:Only one such fast is spoken of as having been instituted and commanded by the Law of Moses, that of the Day of Atonement. This is called &quot;the Fast&quot; in Ac 27:9 (compare Ant, XIV, iv, 3; Philo, Vit Mos, II, 4; Schurer, HJP, I, i, 322).Four annual fasts were later observed by the Jews in commemoration of the dark days of Jerusalem--the day of the beginning of Nebuchadrezzar&#x27;s siege in the tenth month, the day of the capture of the city in the fourth month, the day of its destruction in the fifth month and the day of Gedaliah&#x27;s murder in the seventh month. These are all referred to in Zec 8:19. See FAST.It might reasonably be thought that such solemn anniversaries, once instituted, would have been kept up with sincerity by the Jews, at least for many years. But Isaiah illustrates how soon even the most outraged feelings of piety or patriotism may grow cold and formal. `Wherefore have we fasted and thou seest not?&#x27; the exiled Jews cry in their captivity. `We have humbled our souls, and thou takest no notice.&#x27; Yahweh&#x27;s swift answer follows: `Because your fasting is a mere form! Behold, in the day of your fast ye find your own pleasure and oppress all your laborers&#x27; (compare Isa 58:3; Expositor&#x27;s Bible, at the place). That is to say, so formal has your fasting grown that your ordinary selfish, cruel life goes on just the same. Then Yahweh makes inquest: &quot;Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is not this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? Then shalt thou call, and Yahweh will answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here I am&quot; (Isa 58:5-9). The passage, as George Adam Smith says, fills the earliest, if not the highest place in the glorious succession of Scriptures exalting practical love, to which belong Isa 61; Mt 25; 1Co 13.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-bis&#x27;, (he abussos): In classical Greek the word is always an adjective, and is used(1) literally, &quot;very deep,&quot; &quot;bottomless&quot;;(2) figuratively, &quot;unfathomable,&quot; &quot;boundless.&quot; &quot;Abyss&quot; does not occur in the King James Version but the Revised Version (British and American) so transliterates abussos in each case. The the King James Version renders the Greek by &quot;the deep&quot; in two passages (Lu 8:31; Ro 10:7). In Revelation the King James Version renders by &quot;the bottomless pit&quot; (Re 9:1,2,11; 11:7; 17:8; 20:1,3). In the Septuagint abussos is the rendering of the Hebrew word tehom. According to primitive Semitic cosmogony the earth was supposed to rest on a vast body of water which was the source of all springs of water and rivers (Ge 1:2; De 8:7; Ps 24:2; 136:6). This subterranean ocean is sometimes described as &quot;the water under the earth&quot; (Ex 20:4; De 5:8). According to Job 41:32 tehom is the home of the leviathan in which he plows his hoary path of foam. The Septuagint never uses abussos as a rendering of sheol (= Sheol = Hades) and probably tehom never meant the &quot;abode of the dead&quot; which was the ordinary meaning of Sheol. In Ps 71:20 tehom is used figuratively, and denotes &quot;many and sore troubles&quot; through which the psalmist has passed (compare Jon 2:5). But in the New Testament the word abussos means the &quot;abode of demons.&quot; In Lu 8:31 the King James Version renders &quot;into the deep&quot; (Weymouth and The Twentieth Century New Testament = &quot;into the bottomless pit&quot;). The demons do not wish to be sent to their place of punishment before their destined time. Mark simply says &quot;out of the country&quot; (Lu 5:10). In Ro 10:7 the word is equivalent to Hades, the abode of the dead. In Revelation (where the King James Version renders invariably &quot;the bottomless pit&quot;) abussos denotes the abode of evil spirits, but not the place of final punishment; it is therefore to be distinguished from the &quot;lake of fire and brimstone&quot; where the beast and the false prophet are, and into which the Devil is to be finally cast (Re 19:20; 20:10).See also ASTRONOMY, sec.

Only through Him have we &quot;access by faith into this grace wherein we stand&quot; (Ro 5:2); &quot;Through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father&quot; (Eph 2:18 the King James Version); &quot;in whom we have .... access in confidence, through our faith in him&quot; (Eph 3:12).The goal of redemption is life in God, &quot;unto the Father.&quot; The means of redemption is the cross of Christ, &quot;in whom we have our redemption through his blood&quot; (Eph 1:7). The agent in redemption is the Holy Spirit, &quot;by one Spirit,&quot; &quot;sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise&quot; (Eph 1:13). The human instrumentality, faith. The whole process of approach to, and abiding fellowship with, God is summed up in this brief sentence Access to the Father, through Christ, by the Spirit, by faith.Dwight M. Pratt</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ak&#x27;-o (`akko; [`Akcho]; Ake Ptolemais; Modern Arabic `Akka, English Acre; the King James Version Accho): A town on the Syrian coast a few miles north of Carmel, on a small promontory on the north side of a broad bay that lies between it and the modern town of Haifa. This bay furnishes the best anchorage for ships of any on this coast except that of George, at Beirut, and Alexandretta at the extreme north. As the situation commanded the approach from the sea to the rich plateau of Esdraelon and also the coast route from the north, the city was regarded in ancient times of great importance and at various periods of history was the scene of severe struggles for its possession. It fell within the bounds assigned to the Israelites, particularly to the tribe of Asher, but they were never able to take it (Jos 19:24-31; Jud 1:31).It was, like Tyre and Sidon, too strong for them to attack and it became indeed a fortress of unusual strength, so that it many a siege, often baffling its assailants. In the period of the Crusades it was the most famous stronghold on the coast, and in very early times it was a place of importance and appears in the Tell el-Amarna Letters as a possession of the Egyptian kings. Its governor wrote to his suzerain professing loyalty when the northern towns were falling away (Am Tab 17 BM, 95 B). The Egyptian suzerainty over the coast, which was established by Thothmes III about 1480 BC, was apparently lost in the 14th century, as is indicated in Tell el-Amarna Letters, but was regained under Seti I and his more famous son Rameses II in the 13th, to be again lost in the 12th when the Phoenician towns seem to have established their independence. Sidon however surpassed her sisters in power and exercised a sort of hegemony over the Phoenician towns, at least in the south, and Acco was included in it (Rawl. Phoenica, 407-8).But when Assyria came upon the scene it had to submit to this power, although it revolted whenever Assyria became weak, as appears from the mention of its subjugation by Sennacherib (ib 449), and by Ashurbanipal (ib 458). The latter &quot;quieted&quot; it by a wholesale massacre and then carried into captivity the remaining inhabitants. Upon the downfall of Assyria it passed, together with other Phoenician towns, under the dominion of Babylon and then of Persia, but we have no records of its annals during that period; but it followed the fortunes of the more important cities, Tyre and Sidon. In the Seleucid period (BC 312-65) the town became of importance in the contests between the Seleucids and the Ptolemies. The latter occupied it during the struggles that succeeded the death of Alexander and made it their stronghold on the coast and changed the name to PTOLEMAIS, by which it was known in the Greek and Roman period as we see in the accounts of the Greek and Roman writers and in Josephus, as well as in New Testament (1 Macc 5:22; 10:39; 12:48; Ac 21:7).The old name still continued locally and reasserted itself in later time...</p>

The Outcome of Revelation5. The Question as to Christ&#x27;s MethodLITERATUREI. Introductory.1. Three Uses of the Term: The term &quot;accommodation&quot; is used in three senses which demand careful discrimination and are worthy of separate treatment:(1) the use or application of a Scripture reference in a sense other than the obvious and literal one which lay in the mind and intent of the writer;(2) theory that a passage, according to its original intent, may have more than one meaning or application;(3) the general principle of adaptation on the part of God in His self-revelation to man&#x27;s mental and spiritual capacity.2. The Importance of the Subject: Important issues are involved in the discussion of this subject in each of the three divisions thus naturally presented to us in the various uses of the term. These issues culminate in the supremely important principles which underlie the question of God&#x27;s adaptation of His revelation to men.II. Accommodated Application of Scripture Passages.1. Interpretation a Science: It is obvious that the nature of thought and of language is such as to constitute for all human writings, among which the Bible, as a document to be understood, must be placed, a science of interpretation with a definite body of laws which cannot be violated or set aside without confusion and error. This excludes the indeterminate and arbitrary exegesis of any passage It must be interpreted with precision and in accordance with recognized laws of interpretation. The first and most fundamental of these laws is that a passage is to be interpreted in accordance with the intent of the writer in so far as that can be ascertained. The obvious, literal and original meaning always has the right of way. All arbitrary twisting of a passage in order to obtain from it new and remote meanings not justified by the context is unscientific and misleading.2. Scientific Accommodation: There is, however, a scientific and legitimate use of the principle of accommodation. For example, it is impossible to determine beforehand that a writer&#x27;s specific application of a general principle is the only one of which it is capable. A bald and literal statement of fact may involve a general principle which is capable of broad and effective application in other spheres than that originally contemplated. It is perfectly legitimate to detach a writer&#x27;s statement from its context of secondary and incidental detail and give it a harmonious setting of wider application. It will be seen from this that legitimate accommodation involv...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-koun-ta-bil&#x27;-i-ti.1. Scriptural Principles:The general teaching of Scripture on this subject is summarized in Ro 14:12: &quot;So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.&quot; But this implies, on the one hand, the existence of a Moral Ruler of the universe, whose will is revealed, and, on the other the possession by the creature of knowledge and free will In Ro 4:15 it is expressly laid down that, `where no law is, neither is there transgression&#x27;; but, lest this might seem to exclude from accountability those to whom the law of Moses was not given, it is shown that even heathen had the law to some extent revealed in conscience; so that they are &quot;without excuse&quot; (Ro 1:20). &quot;For as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law: and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law&quot; (Ro 2:12). So says Paul in a passage which is one of the profoundest discussions on the subject of accountability, and with his sentiment agrees exactly the word of our Lord on the same subject, in Lu 12:47,48: &quot;And that servant, who knew his lord&#x27;s will, and made not ready, nor did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes; but he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes And to whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required: and to whom they commit much, of him will they ask the more.&quot;There is a gradual development of accountability accompanying the growth of a human being from infancy to maturity; and there is a similar development in the race, as knowledge grows from less to more. In the full light of the gospel human beings are far more responsible than they were in earlier stages of intellectual and spiritual development, and the doom to which they will be exposed on the day of account will be heavy in proportion to their privileges. This may seem to put too great a premium on ignorance; and a real difficulty arises when we say that, the more of moral sensitiveness there is, the greater is the guilt; because as is well known, moral sensitiveness can be lost through persistent disregard of conscience; from which it might seem to follow that the way to diminish guilt was to silence the voice of conscience. There must, however, be a difference between the responsibility of a conscience that has never been enlightened and that of one which, having once been enlightened, has lost, through neglect or recklessness, the goodness once possessed. In the practice of the law, for example, it is often claimed that a crime committed under the influence of intoxication should be condoned; yet everyone must feel how different this is from innocence, and that, before a higher tribunal, the culprit will be held to be twice guilty--first, of the sin of drunkenness and then of the crime.2.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-kurs&#x27;-ed, a-kurst&#x27;: In the Book of Jos (Jos 6:17,18; 7:1,11,12,13,15) and 1Ch 2:7 &quot;accursed&quot; (or &quot;accursed thing&quot; or &quot;thing accursed&quot;) is the King James Version rendering of the Hebrew word, cherem. The the Revised Version (British and American) consistently uses &quot;devoted&quot; or &quot;devoted thing,&quot; which the King James Version also adopts in Le 27:21,28,29 and in Nu 18:14. &quot;Cursed thing&quot; is the rendering in two passages (De 7:26; 13:17); and in one passage (Eze 44:29 the King James Version) &quot;dedicated thing&quot; is used. In four places the King James Version renders the word by &quot;curse&quot; (Jos 6:18, Isa 34:5, 43:28, Mal 3:18, 4:6) whilst in, another passage (Zec 14:11) &quot;utter destruction&quot; is adopted in translation. These various renderings are due to the fact that the word cherem sometimes means the act of devoting or banning or the condition or state resulting therefrom and sometimes the object devoted or banned. We occasionally find periphrastic renderings, e.g. 1Sa 15:21: &quot;the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed,&quot; the King James Version (literally, &quot;the chief part of the ban&quot;); 1Ki 20:42: &quot;a man whom I appointed to utter destruction,&quot; the King James Version (literally, &quot;a man of my ban&quot; (or &quot;banning&quot;)). The root-word meant &quot;to separate,&quot; &quot;shut off.&quot; The Arabic charim denoted the precincts of the temple at Mecca, and also the women&#x27;s apartment (whence the word &quot;harem&quot;).In Hebrew the word always suggested &quot;separating&quot; or &quot;devoting to God.&quot; Just as qadhosh, meant &quot;holy&quot; or &quot;consecrated to the service&quot; of Yahweh, and so not liable to be used for ordinary or secular purposes, so the stem of cherem meant &quot;devoting&quot; to Yahweh anything which would, if spared, corrupt or contaminate the religious life of Israel, with the further idea of destroying (things) or exterminating (persons) as the surest way of avoiding such contamination. Everything that might paganize or affect the unique character of the religion of Israel was banned, e.g. idols (De 7:26); idolatrous persons (Ex 22:20); idolatrous cities (De 13:13-18). All Canaanite towns-- where the cult of Baal flourished--were to be banned (De 20:16-18). The ban did not always apply to the gold and silver of looted cities (Jos 6:24). Such valuable articles were to be placed in the &quot;treasury of the house of Yahweh.&quot; This probably indicates a slackening of the rigid custom which involved the total destruction of the spoil. According to Nu 18:14, &quot;everything devoted in Israel&quot; belonged to Aaron, and Eze 44:29 the King James Version ordained that &quot;every dedicated thing&quot; should belong to the priests (compare Ezr 10:8). In the New Testament &quot;accursed&quot; is the King James Version rendering of ANATHEMA (which see).Thomas Lewis</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-kuz&#x27;-er: This word, not found in the Old Testament, is the rendering of two Greek words:(1) kategoros, that is, a prosecutor, or plaintiff in a lawsuit, or one who speaks in a derogatory way of another (Ac 23:30,35; 25:16,18; Re 12:10);(2) diabolos, meaning adversary or enemy. This word is rendered &quot;accuser&quot; in the King James Version and &quot;slanderer&quot; in the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version (2Ti 3:3; Titus 2:3). According to the rabbinic teaching Satan, or the devil, was regarded as hostile to God and man, and that it was a part of his work to accuse the latter of disloyalty and sin before the tribunal of the former (see Job 1:6 ff; Zec 3:1 f; Re 12:10).W.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-ka&#x27;-ya (Achaia): The smallest country in the Peloponnesus lying along the southern shore of the Corinthian Gulf, north of Arcadia and east of Elis. The original inhabitants were Ionians, but these were crowded out later by the Acheans, who came from the East. According to Herodotus, the former founded twelve cities, many of which retain their original names to this day. These cities were on the coast and formed a confederation of smaller communities, which in the last century of the independent history of Greece attained to great importance (Achaean League). In Roman times the term Achaia was used to include the whole of Greece, exclusive of Thessaly. Today Achaia forms with Elis one district, and contains a population of nearly a quarter of a million. The old Achean League was renewed in 280 BC, but became more important in 251, when Aratus of Sicyon was chosen commander-in-chief. This great man increased the power of the League and gave it an excellent constitution, which our own great practical politicians, Hamilton and Madison, consulted, adopting many of its prominent devices, when they set about framing the Constitution of the United States. In 146 BC Corinth was destroyed and the League broken up (see 1 Macc 15:23); and the whole of Greece, under the name of Achaia, was transformed into a Roman province, which was divided into two separate provinces, Macedonia and Achaia, in 27 BC.In Ac 18:12 we are told that the Jews in Corinth made insurrection against Paul when Gallio was deputy of Achaia, and in 18:27 that Apollos was making preparations to set out for Achaia In Ro 16:5, &quot;Achaia&quot; should read &quot;ASIA&quot; as in the Revised Version (British and American). In Ac 20:2 &quot;Greece&quot; means Achaia, but the oft- mentioned &quot;Macedonia and Achaia&quot; generally means the whole of Greece (Ac 19:21; Ro 15:26; 1Th 1:8). Paul commends the churches of Achaia for their liberality (2Co 9:13).LITERATURE.See Gerhard, Ueber den Volksstamm der A.

The stem `akhan is not used in Hebrew except in this name. The stem `akhar has sufficient use to define it. It denotes trouble of the most serious kind--Jacob&#x27;s trouble when his sons had brought him into blood feud with his Canaanite neighbors, or Jephthah&#x27;s trouble when his vow required him to sacrifice his daughter (Ge 34:30; Jud 11:35). In Pr 11:17,29; 15:6,27) the word is used with intensity to describe the results of cruelty, disloyalty, greed, wickedness. The record especially speaks of Achan&#x27;s conduct as the troubling of Israel (1Ch 2:7; Jos 6:18; 7:24). In an outburst of temper Jonathan speaks of Saul as having troubled the land (1Sa 14:29). Elijah and Ahab accuse each the other of being the troubler of Israel (1Ki 18:17,18). The stem also appears in the two proper names ACHOR and OCHRAN (which see).The crime of Achan was a serious one. Quite apart from all questions of supposable superstition, or even religion, the cherem concerning Jericho had been proclaimed, and to disobey the proclamation was disobedience to military orders in an army that was facing the enemy. It is commonly held that Achan&#x27;s family were put to death with him, though they were innocent; but the record is not explicit on these points. One whose habits of thought lead him to expect features of primitive savagery in such a case as this will be sure to find what he expects; a person of different habits will not be sure that the record says that any greater cruelty was practiced on the family of Achan than that of compelling them to be present at the execution. Those who hold that the Deuteronomic legislation comes in any sense from Moses should not be in haste to think that its precepts were violated by Joshua in the case of Achan (see De 24:16). The record says that the execution took place in the arable valley of Achor, up from the Jordan valley. See ACHOR.Willis J. Beecher</p>

His father&#x27;s name is given as Maoch (1Sa 27:2), and Maacah (1Ki 2:39). David sought the protection of Achish when he first fled from Saul, and just after his visit to Nob (1Sa 21:10-15). Fearing rough treatment or betrayal by Achish, he feigned madness. But this made him unwelcome, whereupon he fled to the Cave of Adullam (1Sa 22:1). Later in his fugitive period David returned to Gath to be hospitably received by Achish (1Sa 27:1 ff), who gave him the town of Ziklag for his home. A year later, when the Philistines invaded the land of Israel, in the campaign which ended so disastrously for Saul (1Sa 31), Achish wished David to participate (1Sa 28:1-2), but the lords of the Philistines objected so strenuously, when they found him and his men with the forces of Achish, that Achish was compelled to send them back. Achish must have been a young man at this time, for he was still ruling forty years later at the beginning of Solomon&#x27;s reign (1Ki 2:39). He is mentioned as Abimelech in the title of Ps 34.

Location:This, the ancient capital of Media, stood (lat 34 degrees 50&#x27; North--long. 48 degrees 32&#x27; East) near the modern Hamadan, 160 miles West-Southwest of Tehran, almost 6,000 feet above the sea, circa 1 1/2 miles from the foot of Mt. Orontes (Alvand).2. History:It was founded or rebuilt by Deiokes (Dayaukku) about 700 BC on the site of Ellippi an ancient city of the Manda, and captured by Cyrus 549 BC who brought Croesus there as captive (Herodotus i.153). It was the capital of the 10th Nome under Darius I. Cyrus and other Persian kings used to spend the two summer months there yearly, owing to the comparative coolness of the climate. Herodotus describes it as a magnificent city fortified with seven concentric walls (i.98). Its citadel (biretha&#x27;, Ezr 6:2, wrongly rendered &quot;palace&quot; in the Revised Version (British and American)) is mentioned by Arrian, who says that, when Alexander took the city in 324 BC, he there stored his enormous booty. In it the royal archives were kept. It stood on a hill, where later was built a temple of Mithra. Polybius (x.27) speaks of the great strength of the citadel.Though the city was unwalled in his time, he can hardly find words to express his admiration for it, especially for the magnificent royal palace, nearly 7 stadia in circumference, built of precious kinds of wood sheathed in plates of grid and silver. In the city was the shrine of Aine (Nanaea, Anahita?). Alexander is said to have destroyed a temple of AEsculapius (Mithra?) there. Diodorus tells us the city was 250 stadia in circumference. On Mt. Alvand (10,728 feet) there have been found inscriptions of Xerxes. Doubtless Ecbatana was one of the &quot;cities of the Medes&quot; to which Israel was carried captive (2Ki 17:6). It should be noted that Greek writers mention several other Ecbatanas. One of these, afterward called Gazaca (Takhti Sulaiman, a little South of Lake Urmi, lat. 36 degrees 28&#x27; North, long. 47 degrees 9&#x27; East) was capital of Atropatene. It was almost destroyed by the Mughuls in the 12th century. Sir H. Rawlinson identifies the Ecbatana of Tobit and Herodotus with this northern city. The southern and far more important Ecbatana which we have described is certainly that of 2 Macc 9:3. It was Cyrus&#x27; Median capital, and is doubtless that of Ezr 6:2. Classical writers spoke erroneously of Ecbatana (for Ecbatana) as moderns too often do of Hamadan for Hamadan.3. Present Condition:Hamadan has perhaps never fully recovered from the fearful massacre made there in 1220 AD by the Mongols, but its population is about 50,000, including a considerable number of descendants of the Israelites of the Dispers...</p>

See ACHAN): The place where Achan was executed in the time of Joshua (Jos 7:24,26). In all the five places where it is mentioned it is described as the `emek, the arable valley of Achor. There is no ground in the record for the current idea that it must have been a locality with horrid and dismal physical features. It was on a higher level than the camp of Israel in the Jordan valley, and on a lower level than Debir--a different Debir from that of Jos 15:15. In a general way, as indicated by the points mentioned in the border of Judah, it was north of Betharabah, and south of Debir (Jos 7:24; 15:7). Many identify it with the Wady Kelt which descends through a deep ravine from the Judean hills and runs between steep banks south of the modern Jericho to Jordan, the stream after rams becoming a foaming torrent. Possibly the name may have been applied to a region of considerable extent. In Isa 65:10 it is a region on the east side of the mountain ridge which is in some sense balanced with Sharon on the west side. By implication the thing depicted seems to be these rich agricultural localities so far recovered from desolation as to be good grounds for cattle and sheep. Hosea recognizes the comforting aspect of the dreadful affair in the valley of Achor; it was a doorway of hope to pardoned Israel (Ho 2:15 (17)), and he hopes for like acceptance for the Israel of his own day.Willis J.

It is also called Chezib (kezibh (Ge 38:5)), where Judah was at the time of the birth of his son Shelah. In 1Ch 4:22 it is called Cozeba, the King James Version &quot;Chozeba&quot; (kozebha&#x27;), clearly seen to be the same as Achzib, from the places with which it is grouped.(2) It has been identified with the modern `Ayin-Kezbeh in the valley of Elah, and north of Adullam.Edward Mack(3) Mod Zib Septuagint variously: Jos 19:29, Codex Vaticanus, Echozob, Codex Alexandrinus, Achzeiph; Jud 1:31, Codex Vaticanus, Aschazei, Codex Alexandrinus, Aschendei, Greek Ecdippa: A small town some miles north of Acre on the coast. It is mentioned in Jos 19:29 as falling within the possessions of the tribe of Asher, but they never occupied it, as they did not the neighboring Acre (Acco). The Phoenician inhabitants of the coast were too strongly entrenched to be driven out by a people who had no fleet. The cities on the coast doubtless aided one another, and Sidon had become rich and powerful before this and could succor such a small town in case of attack. Achzib was a coast town, nine miles north of Acco, now known as Ez-Zib. It appears in the Assyrian inscriptions as Aksibi and Sennacherib enumerates it among the Phoenician towns that he took at the same times as Acco (702 BC). It was never important and is now an insignificant village among the sand dunes of the coast. It was the bordertown of Galilee on the west, what lay beyond being unholy ground.H. Porter</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a&#x27;-ker (tsemedh): A term of land-measurement used twice in the English versions of the Bible (Isa 5:10; 1Sa 14:14), and said to be the only term in square measure found in the Old Testament. The English word &quot;acre&quot; originally signified field. Then it came to denote the measure of land that an ox team could plow in a day, and upon the basis of a maximum acre of this kind the standard acre of 160 square rods (with variations in different regions) was fixed. The Hebrew word translated acre denotes a yoke of animals, in the sense of a team, a span, a pair; it is never used to denote the yoke by which the team are coupled together. The phrase `ten yokes of vineyard&#x27; (Isa 5:10) may naturally mean vineyard covering as much land as a team would plow in ten days, though other plausible meanings can also be suggested. In 1Sa 14:14 the same word is used in describing the limits of space within which Jonathan and his armor-bearer slew twenty Philistines. The translation of the Revised Version (British and American), &quot;within as it were half a furrow&#x27;s length in an acre of land,&quot; means, strictly, that they were slain along a line from two to twenty rods in length. The word rendered &quot;furrow,&quot; used only here and in Ps 129:3, is in Brown&#x27;s Hebrew Lexicon defined as &quot;plowing-ground.&quot; This gives the rendering &quot;as it were in half a plowing-stint, a yoke of ground,&quot; the last two phrases defining each the other, so that the meaning is substantially that of the paraphrase in the King James Version. There is here an alleged obscurity and uncertainty in the text, but it is not such as to affect either the translation or the nature of the event.Willis J. Beecher</p>

          <h3 style="font-family:var(--font-heading);color:var(--leather-dark);margin:0 0 0.5rem;">ACROSTIC</h3>
          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-kros&#x27;-tik: The acrostic, understood as a short poem in which the first letters of the lines form a word, or name, or sentence, has not yet been proved to occur in ancient Hebrew literature. The supposed examples found by some scholars in Ps 2:1-4 and Ps 110:1-4 are not generally recognized. Still less can be said in favor of the suggestion that in Es 1:20 four words read from left to right form by their initials an acrostic on the name YHWH (compare Konig, Einleitung 293). In Byzantine hymn-poetry the term acrostichis with which our word &quot;acrostic&quot; is connected was also used of alphabetical poems, that is poems the lines or groups of lines in which have their initials arranged in the order of the alphabet. Acrostics of this kind are found in pre-Christian Hebrew literature as well as elsewhere in ancient oriental literature. There are twelve clear instances in the Old Testament: Psalms 25; 34; 37; 111 f; 119; 145; Pr 31:10-31, and La 1-4. There is probably an example in Psalms 9 and 10, and possibly another in Nab 1:2-10. Outside the Canon, Sirach 51:13-30 exhibits clear traces of alphabetic arrangement. Each of these fifteen poems must briefly be discussed.Pss 9 and 10, which are treated as one psalm in Septuagint and Vulg, give fairly clear indications of original alphabetic structure even in the Massoretic Text. The initials of 9:1,3,5 are respectively &#x27;aleph, beth, gimel; of 9:9,11,13,15,17 waw, zayin, cheth, Teth and yodh. Ps 10:1 begins with lamedh and 10:12,14,15,17 with qoph, resh, shin and taw. Four lines seem to have been allotted to each letter in the original form of the poem. In Ps 25 all the letters are represented except waw and qoph. In 25:18 we find resh instead of the latter as well as in its place in 25:19. In 25:2 the alphabetical letter is the initial of the second word. The last verse is again supernumerary. There are mostly two lines to a letter. In Ps 34 all the letters are represented except waw, 34:6 beginning not with it, as was to be expected, but with zayin. The last verse is again a supernumerary. Since here and in 25:22 the first word is a form of padhah it has been suggested that there may have been here a sort of acrostic on the writer&#x27;s name Pedahel pedhah&#x27;el, but there is no evidence that a psalmist so named ever existed. There are two lines to a letter. In Ps 37 all the letters are represented except `ayin which seems however from Septuagint to have been present in the earliest text. As a rule four lines are assigned to each letter. In Psalms 111 f are found two quite regular examples with a line to each letter. Ps 119 offers another regular example, but with 16 lines to a letter, each alternate line beginning with its letter. Vs 1-8, for instance, each begin with &#x27;aleph. In Ps 145 are found all the letters but nun. As we find in Septuagint between 145:13 and 14, that is where the nun couplet ought to be:&quot;Faithful is the Lord in his words And holy in his works,&quot;which may represent a Hebrew couplet beginning w...</p>

Title.It is possible, indeed probable, that the book originally had no title. The manuscripts give the title in several forms. Aleph (in the inscription) has merely &quot;Acts&quot; (Praxeis). So Tischendorf, while Origen, Didymus, Eusebius quote from &quot;The Acts.&quot; But BD Aleph (in subscription) have &quot;Ac of Apostles&quot; or &quot;The Ac of the Apostles&quot; (Praxeis Apostolon). So Westcott and Hort, Nestle (compare Athanasius and Euthalius). Only slightly different is the title in 31,61, and many other cursives (Praxeis ton Apostolon, &quot;Ac of the Apostles&quot;). So Griesbach, Scholz. Several fathers (Clement of Alex, Origen, Dionysius of Alex, Cyril of Jerusalem, Chrysostom) quote it as &quot;The Ac of the Apostles&quot; (Hai Praxeis ton Apostolon). Finally A2 EGH give it in the form &quot;Ac of the Holy Apostles&quot; (Praxeis ton Hagion Apostolon). The Memphitic version has &quot;The Ac of the Holy Apostles.&quot; Clearly, then, there was no single title that commanded general acceptance.II. Text.(1) The chief documents. These are the Primary Uncials (Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Alexandrinus, Codex Vaticanus, Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus, Codex Bezae), Codex Laudianus (E) which is a bilingual Uncial confined to Acts, later Uncials like Codex Modena, Codex Regius, Codex the Priestly Code (P), the Cursives, the Vulgate, the Peshitta and the Harclean Syriac and quotations from the Fathers. We miss the Curetonian and Syriac Sinaiticus, and have only fragmentary testimony from the Old Latin.  (2) The modern editions of Ac present the types of text (Textus Receptus; the Revised Version (British and American); the critical text like that of Westcott and Hort, The New Testament in Greek or Nestle or Weiss or von Soden). These three types do not correspond with the four classes of text (Syrian, Western, Alexandrian, Neutral) outlined by Hort in his Introduction to the New Testament in Greek (1882). These four classes are broadly represented in the documents which give us Acts. But no modern editor of the Greek New Testament has given us the Western or the Alexandrian type of text, though Bornemann, as will presently be shown, argues for the originality of the Western type in Acts. But the Textus Receptus of the New Testament (Stephanus&#x27; 3rd edition in 1550) was the basis of the King James Version of 1611. This edition of the Greek New Testament made use of a very few manuscripts, and all of them late, except Codex Bezae, which was considered too eccentric to follow. Practically, then, the King James Version represents the Syriac type of text which may have been edited in Antioch in the 4th century. Various minor errors may have crept in since that date, but substantially the Syriac recension is the text of the King James Version today. ...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(Adam): The name of Adam occurs nine times (in five different passages) in the New Testament, though several of these are purely incidental.I. Gospels.In Lu 3:38 the ancestry of Jesus Christ is traced up to Adam, &quot;Adam, the son of God,&quot; thereby testifying to the acceptance of the Old Testament genealogies of Gen. This is the only place in the Gospels in which Adam is actually named, though there is an allusion to him in Mt 19:4-6 ( = Mr 10:6-8), referring to Ge 1:27, 2:24.II. Epistles.Adam is used by Paul as the founder of the race and the cause of the introduction of sin in order to point the comparison and contrast with Christ as the Head of the new race and the cause of righteousness.1. Ro 5:12-21:The passage is the logical center of the epistle, the central point to which everything that precedes has converged, and out of which everything which follows will flow. The great ideas of Sin, Death, and Judgment are here shown to be involved in the connection of the human race with Adam. But over against this there is the blessed fact of union with Christ, and in this union righteousness and life. The double headship of mankind in Adam and Christ shows the significance of the work of redemption for the entire race. Mankind is ranged under two heads, Adam and Christ. There are two men, two acts and two results. In this teaching we have the spiritual and theological illustration of the great modern principle of solidarity. There is a solidarity of evil and a solidarity of good, but the latter far surpasses the former in the quality of the obedience of Christ as compared with Adam, and the facts of the work of Christ for justification and life. The section is thus no mere episode, or illustration, but that which gives organic life to the entire epistle. Although sin and death are ours in Adam righteousness and life are ours in Christ, and these latter two are infinitely the greater (Ro 5:11); whatever we have lost in Adam we have more than gained in Christ. As all the evils of the race sprang from one man, so all the blessings of redemption come from One Person, and there is such a connection between the Person and the race that all men can possess what the One has done.In Ro 5:12-19 Paul institutes a series of comparisons and contrasts between Adam and Christ; the two persons, the two works and the two consequences. The fullness of the apostle&#x27;s meaning must be carefully observed. Not only does he teach that what we have derived from the first Adam is met by what is derived from Christ, but the transcendence of the work of the latter is regarded as almost infinite in extent. &quot;The full meaning of Paul, however, is not grasped until we perceive that the benefits received from Christ, the Second Adam, are in inverse ratio to the disaster entailed by the first Adam. It is the surplus of this grace that in Paul&#x27;s presentation is commonly overlooked&quot; (Mabie, The Divine Reason of the Cross 116).2. 1Co 15:22:The contrast instituted here between Adam and Chri...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(Evolutionary Interpretation): NOTE: It ought to be superfluous to say that the unfolding or development of the human personality here identified with evolution is something far higher, deeper, and other than anything that can be fathered upon Darwin or Herbert Spencer. Evolution (unfolding) is the great process or movement; natural selection and survival of the fittest name only guesses at some of its methods. &#x27;adham, &quot;man,&quot; Ge 1:26, or &quot;a man,&quot; Ge 2:5; ha-&#x27;adham, &quot;the man&quot;; mostly with the article as a generic term, and not used as the proper name of a patriarch until 5:3, after which the name first given to both man and woman (5:2) is used of the man alone: The being in whom is embodied the Scripture idea of the first created man and ancestor of mankind. The account, which belongs mostly to the oldest stratum of the Genesis story (Jahwist) merits careful attention, because evolutionary science, history, and new theology have all quarreled with or rejected it on various grounds, without providing the smallest approach to a satisfactory substitute.I. What the Writer Meant to Describe.It is important first of all, if we can, to get at what the author meant to describe, and how it is related, if at all, to literal and factual statement.1. Derivation and Use of the Name:Scholars have exercised themselves much, but with little arrival at certainty, over the derivation of the name; a matter which, as it is concerned with one of the commonest words of the language, is of no great moment as compared with the writer&#x27;s own understanding of it. The most plausible conjecture, perhaps, is that which connects it with the Assyrian adamu, &quot;to make,&quot; or &quot;produce,&quot; hence, &quot;the produced one,&quot; &quot;the creature.&quot; The author of Ge 2:7 seems to associate it, rather by word-play than derivation, with ha-&#x27;adhamah, &quot;the ground&quot; or &quot;soil,&quot; as the source from which man&#x27;s body was taken (compare 3:19,23) The name &#x27;adhamah itself seems to be closely connected with the name Edom (&#x27;edhom, Ge 25:30), meaning &quot;red&quot;; but whether from the redness of the soil, or the ruddiness of the man, or merely the incident recorded in Ge 25:30, is uncertain. Without doubt the writer of Ge 2; 3 had in mind man&#x27;s earthly origin, and understood the name accordingly.2. Outline of the Genesis Narrative:The account of the creation is twice given, and from two very different points of view. In the first account, Ge 1:26- 31, man is represented as created on the sixth of the day along with the animals, a species Genesis in the animal world; but differing from them in bearing the image and likeness of God, in having dominion over all created things, and in having grains and fruits for food, while they have herbs. The writer&#x27;s object in all this seems to be as much to identify man with the animal creation as to differentiate him from it. In the second account, 2:4-3:24, man&#x27;s identity with the animals ignored or at least minimized (compare 2:20), while the object is to determine his status in a spiritual ...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ad&#x27;-am, (&#x27;adham; Septuagint Adam).1. Usage and Etymology:The Hebrew word occurs some 560 times in the Old Testament with the meaning &quot;man,&quot; &quot;mankind.&quot; Outside Ge 1-5 the only case where it is unquestionably a proper name is 1Ch 1:1. Ambiguous are De 32:8, the King James Version &quot;sons of Adam,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;children of men&quot;; Job 31:33 the King James Version &quot;as&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;like Adam,&quot; but margin &quot;after the manner of men&quot;; Ho 6:7 the King James Version &quot;like men,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;like Adam,&quot; and vice versa in the margin. In Ge 1 the word occurs only twice, 1:26,27. In Ge 2-4 it is found 26 times, and in 5:1,3,4,5. In the last four cases and in 4:25 it is obviously intended as a proper name; but the versions show considerable uncertainty as to the rendering in the other cases. Most modern interpreters would restore a vowel point to the Hebrew text in 2:20; 3:17,21, thus introducing the definite article, and read uniformly &quot;the man&quot; up to 4:25, where the absence of the article may be taken as an indication that &quot;the man&quot; of the previous narrative is to be identified with &quot;Adam,&quot; the head of the genealogy found in 5:1 ff. Several conjectures have been put forth as to the root-meaning of the Hebrew word:(1) creature;(2) ruddy one;(3) earthborn. Less probable are(4) pleasant--to sight--and(5) social gregarious.2. Adam in the Narrative of Genesis:Many argue from the context that the language of Ge 1:26,27 is general, that it is the creation of the human species, not of any particular individual or individuals, that is in the described. But(1) the context does not even descend to a species, but arranges created things according to the most general possible classification: light and darkness; firmament and waters; land and seas; plants; sun, moon, stars; swimming and flying creatures; land animals. No possible parallel to this classification remains in the case of mankind.(2) In the narrative of Ge 1 the recurrence of identical expressions is almost rigidly uniform, but in the case of man the unique statement occurs (verse 27), &quot;Male and female created he them.&quot; Although Dillmann is here in the minority among interpreters, it would be difficult to show that he is wrong in interpreting this as referring to one male and one female, the first pair. In this case we have a point of contact and of agreement with the narrative of chapter 2.Man, created in God&#x27;s image, is given dominion over every animal, is allowed every herb and fruit tree for his sustenance, and is bidden multiply and fill the earth. In Ge 2:4-5:5 the first man is made of the dust, becomes a living creature by the breath of God, is placed in the garden of Eden to till it, gives names to the animals, receives as his counterpart and helper a woman formed from part of his own body, and at the woman&#x27;s behest eats of the forbidden fruit of &quot;the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.&quot; With her he is then driv...</p>

The Talmud speaks of a Book of Adam, which is now lost, but which probably furnished some of the material which appears in early Christian writings. The Vita Adami was translated from the Ethiopic by Dillmann (1853), and into English by Malan (The Book of Adam and Eve, London, 1882). The Testament of Adam is a portion of the Vita Adami (published by Renan in 1853) and so probably is the Diatheke ton Protoplaston (Fabricius, II, 83). See APOCALYPTIC LITERATURE; APOCRYPHA.M. O.

The name probably survives at the Damieh Ford, near the mouth of the Jabbok twenty miles above Jericho. An Arabian historian asserts that about 1265 AD the Jordan was here blocked by a land slide. The inner gorge of the Jordan is here narrow with high banks which would facilitate such an obstruction as permitted the waters to &quot;pile up&quot; above to Adam and run out below, permitting Joshua&#x27;s host to cross on dry land (SWP, II, 15; Wright, SCOTH, 130-34).George Frederick Wright</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ad&#x27;-a-mant (shamir (Eze 3:9; Zec 7:12)): In the passages cited and in Jer 17:1, where it is rendered &quot;diamond&quot; the word shamir evidently refers to a hard stone. The word adamant (&quot;unconquerable&quot;) is used in the early Greek writers for a hard metal, perhaps steel, later for a metal-like gold and later for the diamond. The Hebrew shamir, the Greek adamas (from which word &quot;diamond&quot; as well as &quot;adamant&quot; is derived) and the English adamant occur regularly in figurative expressions. All three are equally indefinite. Adamant may therefore be considered a good translation for shamir, though the Septuagint does not use adamas in the passages cited. There is a possible etymological identification of shamir with the Greek smyris (smeris or smiris), emery, a granular form of corundum well known to the ancients and used by them for polishing and engraving precious stones. Corundum in all its forms, including the sapphire and ruby, is in the scale of hardness next to the diamond. In English Versions of the Bible Isa 5:6; 7:23-25; 9:18; 10:17; 27:4; 32:13, shamir is translated &quot;brier&quot;. See also STONES, PRECIOUS.Alfred Ely Day</p>

In the King James Version, Adami and Nekeb are given as separate names, and it is an open question which view of the matter is correct. Most of the Greek texts give the names as two. The Vulgate has &quot;Adami quae est Neceb.&quot; The Jerusalem Talmud gives two names, though instead of Hannekeb or Nekeb it has Siyadathah (Meg 1 1, or Neubauer&#x27;s Geog du Talmud, 225). In the list of places conquered by Thothmes III of Egypt occurs the name NQBU (Tomkins, Rec of Past, new series, V, 47), which seems to be the same with Neqeb.The list of names for the border of Naphtali (Jos 19:33,34) has no name in common with the list of cities (Jos 19:35-38) unless Adami and Adamah are the same. The PE Survey maps locate Adamah at Damieh, about seven miles northwest of the exit of the Jordan from the Lake of Galilee, and Adami at Khurbet Adamah, five or six miles south of the exit. Conder, Tomkins and others place Adami at Damieh, and identify Nekeb by its Talmudic name in the neighboring ruin Seiyadeh. Conder says (art. &quot;Nekeb,&quot; HDB) that the &quot;pass&quot; implied in the name Nekeb &quot;is probably one leading from the eastern precipices near Tiberias.&quot;Willis J. Beecher</p>

Somewhat later Adiabene was absorbed into the Roman Empire and became one of the six provinces which formed the larger province of Assyria, though Pliny and Ammianus sometimes call the large province by the name Adiabene.Willis J.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a&#x27;-din (`adhin, &quot;adorned&quot;): The name of a family, &quot;the sons of Adin&quot; (Ezr 2:15; 8:6; Ne 7:20; 10:16; 1 Esdras 5:14; 8:32), mentioned among the returning exiles. The list in Ezr 2 is placed in the midst of the narrative concerning Zerubbabel, but its title and Its contents show that it also includes the later Jewish immigrants into Palestine. The list in Ne 7 is a duplicate of that in Ezr, but with variations; most of the variations are naturally accounted for by supposing that one copy was made later than the other and was brought up to date. In Ezr and 1 Esdras the number of the sons of Adin is said to be 454; in Ne it is 655. The 50 males, led by Ebed the son of Jonathan, who came with Ezr, may or may not have been included in the numbers just mentioned. Among the names of those who sealed the covenant along with Ne are 44 that are placed under the caption &quot;the chiefs of the people&quot; (Ne 10:14-26), and nearly half of these are the family names of the list in Ezr 2 and Ne 7. It is natural to infer that in these cases a family sealed the covenant collectively through some representative. In that case the Adin here mentioned is the same that is mentioned in the other places. See also ADINU.Willis J. Beecher</p>

This very exact rendering makes it evident even to an English reader that the text is imperfect. Ginsburg offers a corrected form taken substantially from the parallel passage in 1Ch 11:11: &quot;Jashobeam a son of a Hachmonite, chief of the captains; he lifted up his spear.&quot; This is plausible, and is very generally accepted, and eliminates the names Adino and Eznite, which do not occur elsewhere in the Bible. Some of the facts are against this. The Septuagint has the names Adino and Eznite. The Latin finds no proper names in the passage, but so translates the words as to presuppose the Hebrew text as we have it. It may be a case for suspended judgment.The texts concerning David&#x27;s mighty men are fragmentary both in Samuel and in Chronicles. If they were more complete they would perhaps make it clear that the three seniors were comrades of David at Pas-dammim, Ephes- dammim (1Ch 11:13; 1Sa 17:1); and that we have in them additional details concerning that battle. The record says that on the death of Goliath the Philistines fled and the Israelites pursued (1Sa 17:52 ff), but it is not improbable that during the retreat portions of the Philistine force rallied, so that there was strenuous fighting.Willis J.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ad-ju-ra&#x27;-shun: The act of requiring or taking a solemn oath. In a time of military peril Saul adjured the people (&#x27;alah, &quot;to take oath&quot;) and they took oath by saying &quot;Amen&quot; (1Sa 14:24). When Joshua pronounced a ban on Jericho (Jos 6:26) he completed it with an oath (shabha`, &quot;to cause to swear&quot;). Often used in the sense of a solemn charge without the administration of an oath (1Ki 22:16; 2Ch 18:15; So 2:7; 5:8,9; 1Th 5:27). With reference to the withholding of testimony, see Le 5:1 and Pr 29:24. The high priest sought to put Jesus under oath (exorkizo, &quot;to force to an oath,&quot; Mt 26:63). Adjure also means to solemnly implore (horkizo) as when the man with an unclean spirit appealed to Jesus: &quot;I adjure thee by God, torment me not&quot; (Mr 5:7); or seven sons of Sceva, exorcists, sought in the name of Jesus to expel demons (Ac 19:13).(1) The exacting of an oath has, from time immemorial, been a customary procedure in conferring civil and ecclesiastical office and in taking legal testimony. Though often allowed to become painfully trivial and a travesty on its inherent solemnity, the taking of an official oath or the swearing of witnesses is still considered essential to the moral integrity of government, secular or spiritual. False sweating, under solemn oath, constitutes the guilt and heinousness of perjury. The universality of oath-taking is humanity&#x27;s tribute, whether pagan or Christian, to the sacredness of truth.(2) Civilized nations administer oaths under three heads: political, ecclesiastical, legal. The sovereign of England receives the crown only as he or she responds affirmatively to the solemn adjuration of the archbishop or bishop: &quot;Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern,&quot; etc., closing with the affirmation, &quot;So help me God.&quot; A fundamental conviction of civilized nations was expressed by Lycurgus: &quot;An oath is the bond that keeps the state together.&quot; It is the most solemn appeal to the inviolability of the human conscience, and the sacredness of a vow as witnessed both by God and men.

The record gives no details concerning Chileab, the son of David and Abigail. Leaving him out, Adonijah was the oldest living son of David, after the death of Amnon and Absalom.In treating the record it has been needlessly obscured by neglecting or distorting the time data. It says that the rebellion of Absalom broke out &quot;at an end of forty years&quot; (2Sa 15:7). The natural meaning is not forty years after the last-mentioned preceding date, but at the close of the fortieth calendar year of the reign of David. Since David reigned 40 1/2 years (2Sa 5:4,5), the close of his fortieth calendar year was the beginning of has last year. That the date intended was at the beginning of a vernal year is confirmed by the references to the season (2Sa 17:19,28). Instead of giving this number Josephus says that 4 years had elapsed since the last preceding date, which is very likely correct.Many considerations show that the outbreak cannot have occurred much earlier than the fortieth year of David; for Amnon and Absalom were born after David&#x27;s reign began, and were men with establishments of their own before Amnon&#x27;s offense against Tamar, and after that the record, if we accept the numeral of Josephus, accounts for 2 plus 3 plus 2 plus 4, that is, for 11 years (2Sa 13:23,38; 14:28; Ant, VII, ix, 1). In the year following David&#x27;s fortieth year there was ample room for the rebellions of Absalom and of Sheba, the illness of David, the attempt of Adonijah, and the beginning of the reign of Solomon. All things confirm the number forty as giving the date of the outbreak. The common assumption that the forty is to be reduced to four, on the basis of the number in Josephus, is contrary to the evidence.On this view of the chronology all the events fall into line. David&#x27;s idea of making Solomon king was connected with his temple-building idea. This is implied in Kings, and presented somewhat in full in Chronicles. The preparations described in Chronicles (1Ch 22-29) seem to have culminated in David&#x27;s fortieth year (1Ch 26:31). David&#x27;s policy was not altogether popular with the nation. His assembly (1Ch 28:1) is mostly made up of sarim and other appointed officials, the hereditary Israelite &quot;princes&quot; and &quot;elders&quot; being conspicuous by their absence. The outbreak under Absalom was mainly a matter of skillful manipulation; the hearts of the people were really with David. And yet the party of Absalom was distinctly a legitimist party. It believed in the succession of the eldest son, and it objected to many things in the temple-building policy. Joab and Abiathar and others sympathized with this party, but they remained with David out of personal loyalty to him.The Absalom campaign began early in the calendar year. The...</p>

Near the close of the reign of David, and at the opening of the reign of Rehoboam, the same office was held by Adoram (2Sa 20:24; 1Ki 12:18).The name Adoram seems to be a contraction of Adoniram, and doubtless the same person held the office in all the three reigns. The name also appears as Hadoram (2Ch 10:18). In the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) the office is variantly described as &quot;over the tribute,&quot; which is misleading, and &quot;over the levy,&quot; which is correct, though obscure. In the American Standard Revised Version it is uniformly &quot;over the men subject to taskwork.&quot; Adoniram was at the head of the department of forced labor for the government. The record is to the effect that peoples conquered by Israel, except the Canaanites, were to be spared, subject to the obligation to forced labor on the public works (De 20:11); that this law was actually extended to the Canaanites (Jos 16:10; 17:13; Jud 1:28 ff); that David, in his preparations for the temple, organized and handed over to Solomon a service of forced labor (1Ch 22:2,15, etc.); that under Solomon this service was elaborately maintained (1Ki 5:13 ff; 9:15 ff; 2Ch 8:7 ff).It was not for the temple only, but for all Solomon&#x27;s numerous building enterprises. In theory men of Israelite blood were free from this burden, but practically they found it a burden and a grievance. At the accession of Rehoboam they protested against it (1Ki 12; 2Ch 10). Nothing in the account is more indicative of Rehoboam&#x27;s utter lack of good judgment than his sending his veteran superintendent of the forced labor department to confer with the people. The murder of Adoniram, and the ignominious flight of Rehoboam, were natural consequences.Willis J. Beecher</p>

In the Old Testament 2. Greek 3. RomanII. PAUL&#x27;S DOCTRINE1. In Galatians as Liberty 2. In Romans as Deliverance from DebtIII. THE CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE1. In Relation to Justification 2. In Relation to Sanctification 3. In Relation to RegenerationIV. AS GOD&#x27;S ACT1. Divine Fatherhood 2. Its Cosmic Range  This term appears first in New Testament, and only in the epistles of Paul (Ga 4:5; Ro 8:15,23; 9:4; Eph 1:5) who may have coined it out of a familiar Greek phrase of identical meaning. It indicated generally the legal process by which a man might bring into his family, and endow with the status and privileges of a son, one who was not by nature his son or of his kindred.I. The General Legal Idea.The custom prevailed among Greeks, Romans and other ancient peoples, but it does not appear in Jewish law.1. In the Old Testament:Three cases of adoption are mentioned: of Moses (Ex 2:10), Genubath (1Ki 11:20) and Esther (Es 2:7,15), but it is remarkable that they all occur outside of Palestine--in Egypt and Persia, where the practice of adoption prevailed. Likewise the idea appears in the New Testament only in the epistles of Paul, which were addressed to churches outside Palestine. The motive and initiative of adoption always lay with the adoptive father, who thus supplied his lack of natural offspring and satisfied the claims of affection and religion, and the desire to exercise paternal authority or to perpetuate his family. The process and conditions of adoption varied with different peoples. Among oriental nations it was extended to slaves (as Moses) who thereby gained their freedom, but in Greece and Rome it was, with rare exceptions, limited to citizens.2. Greek:In Greece a man might during his lifetime, or by will, to take effect after his death, adopt any male citizen into the privileges of his son, but with the invariable condition that the adopted son accepted the legal obligations and religious duties of a real son.3. Roman:In Rome the unique nature of paternal authority (patria potestas), by which a son was held in his father&#x27;s power, almost as a slave was owned by his master, gave a peculiar character to the process of adoption. For the adoption of a person free from paternal authority (sui juris), the process and effect were practically the same in Rome as in Greece (adrogatio). In a more specific sense, adoption proper (adoptio) was the process by which a person was transferred from his natural father&#x27;s power into that of his adoptive father, and it consisted in a fictitious sale of the son, and his surrender by the natural to the adoptive father.II. Paul&#x27;s Doctrine.As a Roman citizen the apostle would naturally know of the Roman custom, but in the cosmopolitan city of Tarsus, and again on his travels, he would become equally familiar with the corresponding customs of other nations. He employed the idea metaphorically much in the manner of Christ&#x27;s parables, and, as ...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ad-o-ra&#x27;-shun: Though this word never occurs in English Versions, it represents aspects of worship which are very prominent in the Bible.I. Etymology.The word is derived from Latin adorare =(1) &quot;to speak to,&quot;(2) &quot;to beseech,&quot; &quot;entreat,&quot;(3) &quot;to do homage,&quot; &quot;to worship&quot;; from the Latin, os (oris), mouth.Some have supposed that the root os points to the Roman practice of applying the hand to the mouth, i.e. kissing the hand to (a person or thing), as a token of homage.II. Meaning.Adoration is intense admiration culminating in reverence and worship, together with the outward acts and attitudes which accompany such reverence. It thus includes both the subjective sentiments, or feelings of the soul, in the presence of some superior object or person, and the appropriate physical expressions of such sentiments in outward acts of homage or of worship. In its widest sense it includes reverence to beings other than God, especially to monarchs, who in oriental countries were regarded with feelings of awe. But it finds its highest expression in religion. Adoration is perhaps the highest type of worship, involving the reverent and rapt contemplation of the Divine perfections and prerogatives, the acknowledgment of them in words of praise, together with the visible symbols and postures that express the adoring attitude of the creature in the presence of his Creator. It is the expression of the soul&#x27;s mystical realization of God&#x27;s presence in His transcendent greatness, holiness and lovingkindness. As a form of prayer, adoration is to be distinguished from other forms, such as petition, thanksgiving, confession and intercession.III. Outward Postures.In the Old Testament and New Testament, these are similar to those which prevailed in all oriental countries, as amply illustrated by the monuments of Egypt and Assyria, and by the customs still in use among the nations of the East. The chief attitudes referred to in the Bible are the following:1. Prostration:Among the Orientals, especially Persians, prostration (i.e. falling upon the knees, then gradually inclining the body, until the forehead touched the ground) was common as an expression of profound reverence and humility before a superior or a benefactor. It was practiced in the worship of Yahweh (Ge 17:3; Nu 16:45; Mt 26:39, Jesus in Gethsemane; Re 1:17), and of idols (2Ki 5:18; Da 3:5,6), but was by no means confined to religious exercises. It was the formal method of supplicating or doing obeisance to a superior (eg 1Sa 25:23 f; 2Ki 4:37; Es 8:3; Mr 5:22; Joh 11:32).2. Kneeling:A substitute for prostration was kneeling, a common attitude in worship, frequently mentioned in Old Testament and New Testament (eg 1Ki 8:54; Ezr 9:5; Ps 95:6; Isa 45:23; Lu 22:41, Christ in Gethsemane; Ac 7:60; Eph 3:14). The same attitude was sometimes adopted in paying homage to a fellow-creature, as in 2Ki 1:13. &quot;Sitting&quot; as an attitude of prayer (only 2Sa 7:18 parallel 1Ch 17:16) was probably a form of kneeling, as in Mahometan w...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-dorn&#x27; (kosmeo): Has as its primary meaning &quot;to arrange,&quot; &quot;to put In order,&quot; &quot;to decorate.&quot; It is used with reference to the manner in which Christian women were urged to dress. This was a vital question in the early church, and both Paul and Peter give advice on the subject (1Ti 2:9; 1Pe 3:3).See DRESS.Figurative: In Mt 12:44 the King James Version the word is translated &quot;garnish&quot; and is used in a figurative sense. It describes accurately the condition of the Jewish nation. Even though they have swept out idolatry and have adorned the life with much ceremony and endless religious prescriptions yet the evil spirit can say, &quot;I will return to my house.&quot; This same thing has repeatedly been done by individuals and nations when reforms have been instituted, but Christ was not enthroned and the heart or nation was still dominated by evil. It is used also in a figurative sense with reference to the graces of the Christian life. When we remember how very highly Orientals esteem the adornment of the body, its use here becomes very forceful. It is this that makes Ps 45:13 of special significance as to the beauty and glory of the church as she is presented to God. See also Pr 1:9; 4:9; Isa 61:10; 1Pe 3:4,5. Consecration to God, the indwelling of His Spirit, righteousness, a meek and quiet spirit--these are the true adornments of the life. All these passages carry with them the idea of joy, the satisfaction that should be ours in these possessions.Jacob W. Kapp</p>

In the Babylonian pantheon Anu, the god of heaven, is one of the three chief gods, and Adar, otherwise known as Ninib, is a solar god. Concerning the statements in this verse in Kings, archaeologists differ in some important points, and it is a case in which a suspended judgment may be becoming in one who is not an expert. But at least a portion of the alleged difficulties have arisen from failures to get the point of view of the Israelite narrator. He is writing from a time considerably later than the establishment of the institutions of which he speaks--late enough to render the phrase &quot;unto this day&quot; suitable (2Ki 17:34), late enough so that words and usages may have undergone modification. He is describing a mixture of religions which he evidently regards as deserving of contempt and ridicule, even apart from the falsity of the religions included in it. This mixture he describes as containing ingredients of three kinds--first, the imported religions of the imported peoples; second, the local high-place religions (2Ki 17:32, etc.), and third, the Yahweh religion of Northern Israel (not that of Jerusalem). It is not likely that he thought that they practiced any cult in its purity. They contaminated the religion of Yahweh by introducing Canaanitish usages into it, and they are likely to have done the same with the ancestral religions which they brought with them. The proper names may be correct as representing Palestine usage, even if they differ somewhat from the proper Babylonian usage. The writer says that they &quot;burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech,&quot; but this does not necessarily prove that he thought that they brought this practice from Babylonia; his idea may be that they corrupted even their own false cult by introducing into it this horrible Canaanitish rite. In considering the bearings of the evidence of the monuments on the case, considerations of this kind should not be neglected.(2) The name of a son of Sennacherib king of Assyria--one of the two who slew him and escaped, indirectly leading to the accession of Esar-haddon (2Ki 19:37; Isa 37:38). Mention of the incident is found on the monuments, and traces of the name appear in the writings of Abydenus and Poly-histor.Willis J. Beecher</p>

The only reference in the New Testament to it is in Ac 27:2 which says that Paul, while being taken a prisoner from Caesarea to Rome, embarked upon a ship belonging to Adramyttium.The city, with a good harbor, stood at the head of the Gulf of Adramyttium facing the island of Lesbos, and at the base of Mt. Ida. Its early history is obscure. While some authors fancy that it was the Pedasus of Homer, others suppose that it was founded by Adramys, the brother of the wealthy Croesus; probably a small Athenian colony existed there long before the time of Adramys. When Pergamus became the capital of Asia, Adramyttium grew to be a city of considerable importance, and the metropolis of the Northwest part of the province. There the assizes were held. The coins which the peasants pick up in the surrounding fields, and which are frequently aids in determining the location and history of the cities of Asia Minor, were struck at Adramyttium as late as the 3rd century AD, and sometimes in connection with Ephesus. Upon them the effigies of Castor and Pollux appear, showing that Adramyttium was the seat of worship of these deities.The ancient city with its harbor has entirely disappeared, but on a hill, somewhat farther inland, is a village of about one thousand houses bearing the name Edremid, a corruption of the ancient name Adramys. The miserable wooden huts occupied by Greek fishermen and by Turks are surrounded by vineyards and olive trees, hence the chief trade is in olive oil, raisins and timber. In ancient times Adramyttium was noted for a special ointment which was prepared there (Pliny, NH, xiii.2.5).E. J. Banks</p>

The Adriatic Sea is a name derived from the old Etruscan city Atria, situated near the mouth of the Po (Livy v.33.7; Strabo v.214). At first the name Adria was only applied to the most northern part of the sea. But after the development of the Syracusan colonies on the Italian and Illyrian coasts the application of the term was gradually extended southward, so as to reach Mons Garganus (the Abruzzi), and later the Strait of Hydruntum (Ptolemy iii.1.1; Polybios vii.19.2). But finally the name embraced the Ionian Sea as well, and we find it employed to denote the Gulf of Tarentum (Servius Aen xi.540), the Sicilian Sea (Pausanias v. 25), and even the waters between Crete and Malta (Orosius i.2.90). Procopius considers Malta as lying at the western extremity of the Adriatic Sea (i.14). After leaving Crete the vessel in which the apostle Paul was sailing under military escort was &quot;driven to and fro in the sea of Adria&quot; fourteen days (Ac 27:27) before it approached the shore of Malta. We may compare this with the shipwreck of Josephus in &quot;the middle of the Adria&quot; where he was picked up by a ship sailing from Cyrene to Puteoli (Josephus, Vita, 3).George H. Allen</p>

In the list of 31 kings whom Joshua smote, Adullam follows Hormah, Arad, Libnah, and precedes Makkedah. Among the 14 Judahite cities of the first group in &quot;the lowland&quot; Adullam is mentioned between Jarmuth and Socoh. In the list of 15 cities fortified by Rehoboam it appears between Socoh and Gath. Micah gives what may be a list of cities concerned in some Assyrian approach to Jerusalem; it begins with Gath, includes Lachish, and ends with Mareshah and Adullam. And Adullam is still in the same company in the list in Nehemiah of the cities &quot;and their villages&quot; where the men of Judah then dwelt. In the time of the patriarchs it was a place to which men &quot;went down&quot; from the central mountain ridge (Ge 38:1). Judas Maccabeus found it still existing as a city (2 Macc 12:38). Common opinion identifies Adullam with the ruin `Aid-el-Ma, 13 miles West-Southwest from Bethlehem (see HGHL, 229 ff). This is in spite of the testimony of the Onomasticon, which, it is alleged, confuses Adullam with Eglon. Presumably the city gave its name to the cave of Adullam, the cave being near the city.(2) The cave of Adullam, David&#x27;s headquarters during a part of the time when he was a fugitive from Saul (1Sa 22:1; 2Sa 23:13; 1Ch 11:15). Sufficient care has not been exercised in reading the Bible statements on this subject. To begin with, Hebrew syntax permits of the use of the word &quot;cave&quot; collectively; it may denote a group or a region of caves; it is not shut up to the meaning that there was one immense cave in which David and his 400 men all found accommodations at once. All reasonings based on this notion are futile.Further, by the most natural syntax of 2Sa 23:13-17 (duplicated with unimportant variations in 1Ch 11:15-19), that passage describes two different events, and does not connect the cave of Adullam with the second of these. &quot;And three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim. And David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem. And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water,&quot; etc. Concerning these three seniors among David&#x27;s &quot;mighty men&quot; it is narrated, first, that they were David&#x27;s comrades in a certain battle, a battle which the Chronicler identifies with Pas-dammim, where David slew Goliath; second, that they joined David at the cave of Adullam, presumably during the time when he was hiding from Saul; third, that at a later time, when the Philistines were in the valley of Rephaim (compare 2Sa 5:18), and David was &quot;in the stronghold&quot; (Josephus says &quot;at Jerusalem,&quot; Ant, VII, xii, 4), these men broke through the Philistine lines and brought him water from the ho...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-dul&#x27;-ter-i: In Scripture designates sexual intercourse of a man, whether married or unmarried, with a married woman.1. Its Punishment:It is categorically prohibited in the Decalogue (seventh commandment, Ex 20:14; De 5:18): &quot;Thou shalt not commit adultery.&quot; In more specific language we read: &quot;And thou shalt not he carnally with thy neighbor&#x27;s wife, to defile thyself with her&quot; (Le 18:20). The penalty is death for both guilty parties: &quot;And the man that committeth adultery with another man&#x27;s wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor&#x27;s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death&quot; (Le 20:10). The manner of death is not particularized; according to the rabbis (Siphra&#x27; at the place; Sanhedhrin 52b) it is strangulation. It would seem that in the days of Jesus the manner of death was interpreted to mean stoning (&quot;Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such,&quot; Joh 8:5, said of the woman taken in adultery). Nevertheless, it may be said that in the case in question the woman may have been a virgin betrothed unto a husband, the law (in De 22:23 f) providing that such a person together with her paramour be stoned to death (contrast De 22:22, where a woman married to a husband is spoken of and the manner of death is again left general). Eze 16:40 (compare 23:47) equally mentions stoning as the penalty of the adulteress; but it couples to her sin also that of shedding blood; hence, the rabbinic interpretation is not necessarily disputed by the prophet. Of course it may also be assumed that a difference of custom may have obtained at different times and that the progress was in the line of leniency, strangulation being regarded as a more humane form of execution than stoning.2. Trial by Ordeal:The guilty persons become amenable to the death penalty only when taken &quot;in the very act&quot; (Joh 8:4). The difficulty of obtaining direct legal evidence is adverted to by the rabbis (see Makkoth 7a). In the case of a mere suspicion on the part of the husband, not substantiated by legal evidence, the woman is compelled by the law (Nu 5:11-30) to submit to an ordeal, or God&#x27;s judgment, which consists in her drinking the water of bitterness, that is, water from the holy basin mingled with dust from the floor of the sanctuary and with the washed-off ink of a writing containing the oath which the woman has been made to repeat. The water is named bitter with reference to its effects in the case of the woman&#x27;s guilt; on the other hand, when no ill effects follow, the woman is proved innocent and the husband&#x27;s jealousy unsubstantiated. According to the Mishna (SoTah 9) this ordeal of the woman suspected of adultery was abolished by Johanan ben Zaccai (after 70 AD), on the ground that the men of his generation were not above the suspicion of impurity.See article BITTER, BITTERNESS.3. A Heinous Crime:Adultery was regarded as a heinous crime (Job 31:11). The prophets and teachers in Israel repeatedly upbraid the men and women of their generati...</p>

It is identified with the gorge part of the road from Jericho up to Jerusalem. Its present name is Tala`at-ed-Dumm, &quot;ascent of blood.&quot; The stone is marked by &quot;curious red streaks,&quot; a phenomenon which probably accounts for both the ancient and the modern names, and for other similar names which have been applied to the locality. It is the scene of our Saviour&#x27;s story of the Good Samaritan, and tradition of course locates the inn to which the Samaritan brought the wounded man (see HGHL, 265).Willis J. Beecher</p>

In thirty-two cases the word corresponds to the noun tsar, or the verb tsarar. This noun is the ordinary word for &quot;foe&quot; or &quot;adversary.&quot; In twelve passages the Hebrew word, of which &quot;adversary&quot; is the translation, is saTan = noun or saTan = verb. This stem means &quot;to oppose,&quot; or &quot;thwart&quot; anyone in his purpose or claims.The angel of Yahweh was saTan to Balaam (Nu 22:22). The word often denotes a political adversary (1Ki 11:14,23,25). In four cases (namely, Prologue to Job; Zec 3:1,2; 1Ch 21:1; Ps 109:6) the King James Version retains Satan as the rendering. But it is only in 1 Chronicles that the word is used without the article, that is, strictly as a proper name. The Septuagint gives diabolos, as the rendering, and both in Job and Zechariah, Satan is portrayed as the &quot;false accuser.&quot; In two cases &quot;adversary&quot; represents two Hebrew expressions which mean the &quot;opponent in a suit&quot; or &quot;controversy&quot; (Job 31:35; Isa 50:8).In the New Testament &quot;adversary&quot; represents:(1) antikeimenoi, the participle of a verb which means &quot;to be set over against,&quot; &quot;to be opposed&quot; (Lu 13:17; Php 2:8).(2) antidikos, &quot;opponent in a lawsuit,&quot; &quot;prosecutor&quot; (Mt 5:25; Lu 12:58; 18:3; 1Pe 5:8).According to the last passage the devil is the &quot;accuser&quot; or &quot;prosecutor&quot; of believers, but according to another writer they have an &quot;advocate&quot; or &quot;counselor for the defense&quot; with the Father (1Jo 2:1). In one passage (Heb 10:27) &quot;adversary&quot; represents a Greek word, hupenantios, which means &quot;set over against,&quot; &quot;contrary to&quot;--a word used in classical Greek and in the Septuagint.Thomas Lewis</p>

Christ in heaven intercedes for Christians who sin upon earth. The next verse declares that He is the &quot;propitiation for our sins&quot; and it is His propitiatory work which lies at the basis of His intercession. The margins of the Revised Version (British and American) and the American Standard Revised Version give as alternative readings Comforter, Helper, Greek Paraclete.

In the Gnostic philosophy it has a special meaning and is there used to solve the problem of the world order. In the infinite separation between God and the world, it was taught, there must of necessity be mediating powers. These powers are the eons and are the successive emanations from God from eternity. They are spiritual, existing as distinct entities. They constituted the Divine fullness or the Divine Pleroma. The name was applied to these beings for two reasons: because they were thought to partake of the eternal existence of God and because they were supposed to govern the various ages. The idea of the eons in various forms may be found in nearly all oriental philosophy that attempted to deal with the problem of the world order.

The same Greek word (zeloo) is translated &quot;desire earnestly&quot; in the Revised Version (British and American) (1Co 12:31; 14:1,39). &quot;Affect&quot; has a similar meaning in Ecclesiasticus 13:11.(3) In the passive, it occurs in the sense of &quot;to be disposed,&quot; in a neutral sense, with an adverb to characterize the nature of the disposition: Ac 14:2, &quot;evil affected against the brethren&quot; So also 2 Macc 4:21; 13:26.&quot;Affection&quot; occurs in the following senses:(1) In the literal sense: the state of having one&#x27;s feelings acted upon or affected in some way; bent or disposition of mind, in a neutral sense (the nature of the affection, whether good or bad, needing further description in the context). So Col 3:2, &quot;Set your affection (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;mind&quot;) on things above&quot;; Col 3:5, &quot;inordinate affection&quot; (here &quot;affection&quot; by itself is neutral; the addition of the adjective makes it equivalent to &quot;passion&quot; in an evil sense, as in the Revised Version (British and American)).(2) In a good sense: tender feeling, warm attachment, good will; the word in itself carrying a good meaning apart from the context. 1Ch 29:3, &quot;because I have set my affection on the house of my God&quot;; Ro 1:31; 2Ti 3:3, &quot;without natural affection&quot;, 2Co 6:12 &quot;Ye are straitened in your own affections&quot; (lit. &quot;bowels,&quot; regarded as the seat of kindly feelings, compare Eng &quot;heart&quot;) So 2Co 7:15.(3) In an evil sense in the plural = passions. Ga 5:24, the flesh, with the affections (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;passions&quot;) and &quot;lusts&quot;; Ro 1:26, &quot;God gave them unto vile affections&quot; (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;passions&quot;).&quot;Affectioned&quot; occurs once, in a neutral sense: Ro 12:10, &quot;affectioned (i.e. &quot;disposed&quot;) one to another&quot; In 1Th 2:8, we have &quot;affectionately,&quot; in a good sense.D.

The Hebrew does not employ affirmative particles, but gives a positive reply by either repeating the word in question or by substituting the first person in the reply for the second person in the question, or by employing the formula: &quot;Thou hast said&quot; or &quot;Thou hast rightly said.&quot; The Saviour used this idiom (su eipas) when answering Judas and Caiaphas (Mt 26:25,64). A peculiar elegance occasionally attaches to the interpretation of the Scriptures because of their use of an affirmative and a negative together, rendering the sense more emphatic; sometimes the negative occurs first, as in Ps 118:17: &quot;I shall not die, but live&quot;; sometimes the affirmative precedes, as in Isa 88:1: &quot;Thou shalt die, and not bye&quot; Joh 1:20 is made peculiarly emphatic because of the negative placed between two affirmatives: &quot;And he confessed, and denied not; and he confessed, I am not the Christ.&quot;Frank E.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-flik&#x27;-shun: Represents no fewer than 11 Hebrew words in the Old Testament, and 3 Greek words in the New Testament, of which the most common are (oni), (thlipsis). It is used(1) actively = that which causes or tends to cause bodily pain or mental distress, as &quot;the bread of affliction&quot; (De 16:3; 2Ch 18:26); often in plural, as &quot;Many are the afflictions of the righteous&quot; (Ps 34:19);(2) passively = the state of being in pain or trouble, as &quot;to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction&quot; (Jas 1:27).The following are the chief forms of affliction referred to:(1) Individual affliction, especially sickness, poverty, the oppression of the weak by the strong and rich, perverted justice.(2) National. A great place is given in the Old Testament to affliction as a national experience, due to calamities, such as war, invasion, conquest by foreign peoples, exile. These form the background of much of the prophetic writings, and largely determine their tone and character.(3) In the New Testament the chief form of affliction is that due to the fierce antagonism manifested to the religion of Jesus, resulting in persecution.I. The Source of Affliction.1. God:The Hebrew mind did not dwell on secondary causes, but attributed everything, even afflictions, directly to the great First Cause and Author of all things: &quot;Shall evil befall a city, and Yahweh hath not done it?&quot; (Am 3:6); &quot;I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil (i.e. calamity); I am Yahweh, that doeth all these things&quot; (Isa 45:7) Thus, all things, including calamity, were referred to the Divine operation. The Hebrew when afflicted did not doubt the universal sovereignty of God; yet, while assuming this sovereignty, he was sometimes tempted to accuse Him of indifference, neglect or forgetfulness. Compare Job passim; Isa 40:27; 49:14; Eze 8:12; 9:9.2. Evil Agents:Yet there are traces of a dualism which assigns a certain vague limit to God&#x27;s absolute sovereignty, by referring affliction to an evil agency acting in quasi-independence of God. There could, however, never be more than a tendency in this direction, for a strict dualism was incompatible with the standpoint of Jewish monotheism. Thus Saul&#x27;s mental affliction is attributed to an &quot;evil spirit,&quot; which is yet said to be &quot;from Yahweh&quot; (1Sa 16:14; 18:10; 19:9); and the fall of Ahab is said by Micaiah to be due to the &quot;lying spirit&quot; which enticed him to his doom, in obedience to God&#x27;s command (1Ki 22:20-22). In the prologue of Job, Job&#x27;s calamities are ascribed to the Satan, but even he receives his word of command from God, and is responsible to Him, like the other &quot;sons of God&quot; who surround the heavenly throne. He is thus &quot;included in the Divine will and in the circle of Divine providence&quot; (Schultz). After the prologue, the Satan is left out of account, and Job&#x27;s misfortunes are attributed directly to the Divine causality. In later Judaism, the tendency to trace the origin of evil, physical and moral, to wicked spirits...</p>

It has been disputed whether in this word ana has the reiterative force (&quot;again,&quot; &quot;anew&quot;). In classical Greek anastauroo has always the simple sense of &quot;to crucify,&quot; (ie. &quot;to rinse up on a cross,&quot; ana being merely &quot;up&quot;). So some would render it here (eg. Cremer, Lexicon of New Testament Greek). Against this it is argued(1) that the classical writers had no occasion for the idea of crucifying anew (compare Winer, De verb. Comp., etc., Pt III, 9 ff, Leipzig, 1843);(2) that in many compounds ana signifies both &quot;up&quot; and &quot;again,&quot; as in anablepo, which means &quot;to recover sight&quot; as well as &quot;to look up&quot;;(3) that the rendering &quot;crucify afresh&quot; suits the context;(4) that the Greek expositors (eg. Chrysostom) take it so without questioning. (So also Bleek, Lunemann, Alford, Westcott; compare the Vulgate&#x27;s rursum crucifigentes.)D. Miall Edwards</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">af&#x27;-ri-ka: The name of this tract, as a continent, does not occur in the Bible, and it was only in later days known as one of the quarters of the world, under the name of Libya--that portion opposite the coast of Greece and West of Egypt.1. Africa as Known to the Ancients:Naturally the most considerable part of Africa known to the Hebrews was Egypt itself, but Libya is regarded as being referred to under the names of Lehabim and Lubim (Ludim) (Ge 10:13; 2Ch 12:3)--words indicating, as often with the Semites, not the country itself, but its inhabitants. Other portions of Africa known to the Hebrews were Cush or Ethiopia, and Put, whose inhabitants they regarded as belonging to the Hamitic stock. Canaan, also Cushite and therefore Hamitic, naturally did not belong to the African continent, showing that the divisions of then known world into &quot;quarters&quot; (Europe, Asia, Africa) had not taken place when the Table of the Nations (Ge 10:1 ff) was drawn up--indeed, these division were not apparently thought of until many centuries later. The Casluhim and the Naphtuhim (Ge 10:13,14) were in all probability African peoples, though their position is in general regarded as uncertain. For the Hebrews, to all appearance, the southernmost point of Africa was Cush or Ethiopia, called by the Assyrians and Babylonians Kusu and Meluhha (Meroe), which included the district now known as the Sudan, or Black region. The sons of Cush, and also those of his firstborn, Sheba, were all Arabian tribes, nominally under the domain of Mizraim or Egypt, and on this account classed with the descendants of Ham.2. The Cushites and the Negroes:It will thus be seen that the Negro districts were practically unknown to the ancient Hebrews, though men and women of Negro race must have come within their ken. It seems doubtful, therefore, whether there be, in the Bible, any reference to that race, either collectively or individually, the word Cushite standing, not for Negro, but for Ethiopian. This term is applied to Moses&#x27; (first) wife (Nu 12:1), and it will probably be generally admitted, that the great Hebrew lawgiver is not likely to have espoused a Negro woman. The Ethiopian eunuch converted by Philip the Evangelist (Ac 8:26 ff) was an official of Meroe, and an educated man, for he could read the Old Testament in the Greek(Septuagint) version. Commerce must have revealed to the Hebrews the whereabouts of the various peoples of Africa with whom they came into contact, and they acquired a personal knowledge of Egypt when the 12 tribes were in bondage there. During this period, it may be supposed, they saw from time to time visitors from the South--people who are not mentioned in the sacred books of the Old Testament because the Hebrews, as a nation, never came into contact with them. Apart from Egypt, the history of the portion of Africa known to the Hebrews was a chequered one, as it came successively under Egypt, Phoenicia, Greek and Roman civilization.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ag&#x27;-a-bus (Agabos): A Christian prophet of Jerusalem, twice mentioned in Acts.(1) In Ac 11:27 f, we find him at Antioch foretelling &quot;a great famine over all the world,&quot; &quot;which,&quot; adds the historian, &quot;came to pass in the days of Claudius.&quot; This visit of Agabus to Antioch took place in the winter of 43-44 AD, and was the means of urging the Antiochian Christians to send relief to the brethren in Judea by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. Two points should be noted.(a) The gift of prophet&#x27;s here takes the form of prediction. The prophet&#x27;s chief function was to reveal moral and spiritual truth, to &quot;forth-tell&quot; rather than to &quot;foretell&quot;; but the interpretation of God&#x27;s message sometimes took the form of predicting events.(b) The phrase &quot;over all the world&quot; (practically synonymous with the Roman Empire) must be regarded as a rhetorical exaggeration if strictly interpreted as pointing to a general and simultaneous famine. But there is ample evidence of severe periodical famines in various localities in the reign of Claudius (eg. Suet Claud. 18; Tac. Ann. xii.43), and of a great dearth in Judea under the procurators Cuspius Fadus and Tiberius Alexander, 44-48 AD (Ant., XX, ii, 6; v, 2), which probably reached its climax circa 46 AD.(2) In Ac 21:10 f we find Agabus at Caesarea warning Paul, by a vivid symbolic action (after the manner of Old Testament prophets; compare Jer 13:1 ff; Eze 3; 4) of the imprisonment and suffering he would undergo if he proceeded to Jerusalem.(3) In late tradition Agabus is included in lists of the seventy disciples of Christ.D.

It is used of two of these kings:(1) A king of Amalek, mentioned by Balaam (Nu 24:7) in his blessing of Israel;(2) A later king, in the days of King Saul (1Sa 15). Saul was sent with his army to destroy the Amalekites, who had so violently opposed Israel in the Wilderness. He disregarded the Divine command, sparing the best of the spoil, and saving Agag the king alive (1Sa 15:8,9).

Jewish tradition always assigned the arch-enemies of Israel membership in the house of Amalek, the hereditary foe of the nation. Compare Ant, XI, vi, 5. The word Agag has properly been taken by Delitzsch as related to the Assyrian agagu, &quot;to be powerful,&quot; &quot;vehement,&quot; &quot;angry.&quot; In the Greek parts of Esther, Haman is termed a Macedonian (Es 1:2-6; 1:6-10). The name Haman is probably of Elamitic origin. Oppert&#x27;s attempt to connect the term &quot;Agagite&quot; with &quot;Agaz,&quot; a Median tribe mentioned by Sargon, has found no supporters.

Sometimes also applied to what breaks an established order as &quot;customs&quot; (Ac 28:17), &quot;nature&quot; (Ro 1:26).

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ag&#x27;-a-pe (agape).1. The Name and the Thing:The name Agape or &quot;love-feast,&quot; as an expression denoting the brotherly common meals of the early church, though of constant use and in the post-canonical literature from the time of Ignatius onward, is found in the New Testament only in Jude 1:12 and in 2Pe 2:13 according to a very doubtful reading. For the existence of the Christian common meal, however, we have abundant New Testament evidence. The&quot;breaking of bread&quot; practiced by the primitive community in Jerusalem according to Ac 2:42,46 must certainly be interpreted in the light of Pauline usage (1Co 10:16; 11:24) as referring to the ceremonial act of the Lord&#x27;s Supper. But the added clause in 2:46, &quot;they took there food with gladness and singleness of heart,&quot; implies that a social meal was connected in some way with this ceremonial act. Paul&#x27;s references to the abuses that had sprung up in the Corinthian church at the meetings for the observance of the Lord&#x27;s Supper (1Co 11:20-22,33,34) make it evident that in Corinth as in Jerusalem the celebration of the rite was associated with participation in a meal of a more general character. And in one of the &quot;we&quot; sections of Ac (20:11) where Luke is giving personal testimony as to the manner in which the Lord&#x27;s Supper was observed by Paul in a church of his own founding, we find the breaking of bread associated with and yet distinguished from an eating of food, in a manner which makes it natural to conclude that in Troas, as in Jerusalem and Corinth, Christians when they met together on the first day of the week were accustomed to partake of a common meal. The fact that the name Agape or love-feast used in Jude 1:12 (Revised Version) is found early in the 2nd century and often afterward as a technical expression for the religious common meals of the church puts the meaning of Jude&#x27;s reference beyond doubt.2. Origin of the Agape:So far as the Jerusalem community was concerned, the common meal appears to have sprung out of the koinonia or communion that characterized the first days of the Christian church (compare Ac 1:14; 2:1 etc.). The religious meals familiar to Jews--the Passover being the great type--would make it natural In Jerusalem to give expression by means of table fellowship to the sense of brotherhood, and the community of goods practiced by the infant church (Ac 2:44; 4:32) would readily take the particular form of a common table at which the wants of the poor were supplied out of the abundance of the rich (Ac 6:1 ff). The presence of the Agape in the Greek church of Corinth was no doubt due to the initiative of Paul, who would hand on the observances associated with the Lord&#x27;s Supper just as he had received them from the earlier disciples; but participation in a social meal would commend itself very easily to men familiar with the common meals that formed a regular part of the procedure at meetings of those religious clubs and associations which were so numerous at that time throughout the Gre...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ag&#x27;-o-ni (agonia; Vulgate agonia):A word occurring only once in the New Testament (Lu 22:44), and used to describe the climax of the mysterious soul-conflict and unspeakable suffering of our Lord in the garden at Gethsemane. The term is derived from the Greek agon &quot;contest&quot; and this in turn from the Greek ago &quot;to drive or lead,&quot; as in a chariot race. Its root idea is the struggle and pain of the severest athletic contest or conflict. The wrestling of the athlete has its counterpart in the wrestling of the suffering soul of the Saviour in the garden. At the beginning of this struggle He speaks of His soul being exceeding sorrowful even unto death, and this tumult of emotion culminated in the agony. All that can be suggested by the exhausting struggles and sufferings of charioteers, runners, wrestlers and gladiators, in Grecian and Roman amphitheaters, is summed up in the pain and death-struggle of this solitary word &quot;agony.&quot; The word was rendered by Wyclif (1382) &quot;maad in agonye&quot; Tyndale (1534) and following translators use an agony.&quot; The record of Jesus&#x27; suffering in Gethsemane, in the Synoptic Gospels (Mt 26:36-46; Mr 14:32-42; Lu 22:39-46, and also in He 5:7,8) indicates that it was threefold:1. Physical:The agony of His soul wrought its pain on His body, until &quot;his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground&quot; (Lu 22:44, omitted by some ancient authorities). He offered His prayers and supplications &quot;with strong crying and tears&quot; (He 5:7). The intensity of His struggle so distressed and weakened Him that Luke says &quot;there appeared unto him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.&quot; The threefold record of the evangelists conveys the idea of the intensest physical pain. As the wire carries the electric current, so every nerve in Jesus&#x27; physical being felt the anguish of His sensitive soul as He took upon Himself the burden of the world&#x27;s sin and moral evil.2. Mental:The crisis of Jesus&#x27; career as Messiah and Redeemer came in Gethsemane. The moral issue of His atoning work was intelligently and voluntarily met here. The Gospels exhaust language in attempting to portray the stress and struggle of this conflict. &quot;My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death.&quot; &quot;Being in an agony he prayed more earnestly, saying, Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me.&quot; The mental clearness of Christ&#x27;s vision of humanity&#x27;s moral guilt and the energy of will necessary to meet the issue and take &quot;this cup&quot; of being the world&#x27;s sin- bearer, indicate the awful sorrow and anguish of His supernatural conflict. It is divinely significant that the word &quot;agony&quot; appears but once in all Scripture. This solitary word records a solitary experience. Only One ever compassed the whole range of the world&#x27;s sorrow and pain, anguish and agony. The shame of criminal arrest in the garden and of subsequent condemnation and death as a malefactor had to His innocent soul the horror of humanity&#x27;s entire and ageless guilt.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ag&#x27;-ra-fa (agrapha).1. The Term and Its History:The word agraphos of which agrapha is the neuter plural is met with in classical Greek and in Greek papyri in its primary sense of &quot;unwritten,&quot; &quot;unrecorded.&quot; In early Christian literature, especially in the writings of Clement of Alexandria, it was used of oral tradition; and in this sense it was revived by Koerner in a Leipzig Program issued in 1776 under the title De sermonibus Christi agraphois. For some time it was restricted to sayings of Christ not recorded in the Gospels and believed to have reached the sources in which they are found by means of oral tradition. As however graphe, the noun with which agrapha is connected, can have not only the general meaning &quot;writing,&quot; but the special meaning &quot;Scripture,&quot; the, adjective could signify not only &quot;oral&quot; but also uncanonical or &quot;non-canonical&quot;; and it was employed by Resch in the latter sense in the 1st edition of his great work on the subject which appeared in German in 1889 under the title, Agrapha: Extra-canonical Gospel Fragments. The term was now also extended so as to include narratives as well as sayings. In the second edition (also in German) it is further widened so as to embrace all extra-canonical sayings or passages connected with the Bible. The new title runs: Agrapha Extra-canonical Fragments of Scripture; and the volume contains a first collection of Old Testament agrapha. The term is still however used most frequently of non-canonical sayings ascribed to Jesus, and to the consideration of these this article will mainly be devoted.2. Extent of Material:Of the 361 agrapha and apocrypha given by Resch about 160 are directly ascribed to Christ. About 30 others can be added from Christian and Jewish sources and about 80 sayings found in Muhammadan literature (Expository Times, V, 59, 107, 177 f, 503 f, 561, etc.). The last-mentioned group, although not entirely without interest, may largely be disregarded as it is highly improbable that it represents early tradition. The others come from a variety of sources: the New Testament outside of the Gospels, Gospel manuscripts and VSS, Apocryphal Gospels and an early collection of sayings of Jesus, liturgical texts, patristic and medieval literature and the Talmud.3. Sayings to Be Excluded:Many of these sayings have no claim to be regarded as independent agrapha. At least five classes come under this category.(1) Some are mere parallels or variants, for instance: &quot;Pray and be not weary,&quot; which is evidently connected with Lu 18:1; and the saying in the Talmud: &quot;I, the Gospel, did not come to take away from the law of Moses but to add to the law of Moses have I come&quot; (Shab 116b) which is clearly a variant of Mt 5:17.(2) Some sayings are made up of two or more canonical texts. &quot;I chose you before the world was,&quot; for example, is a combination of Joh 15:19 and Eph 1:4; and &quot;Abide in my love and I will give you eternal life&quot; of Joh 8:31 and Joh 10:28.(3) Misquotation or loose quotation accounts for ...</p>

Ideas and Circumstances of the Legislation 6. Form of the Legislation 7. Its Operation and Extension 8. Other Laws Affecting the Land  The Mosaic provisions on this subject form one of the most characteristic and interesting portions of the legislation. The main institutions are two, namely, the Sabbath year and the jubilee, and they are closely linked together.1. The Sabbath Year:In every seventh year the land was to lie fallow &quot;that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat&quot; (Ex 23:10 f; compare Le 25:2-7). `And the Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger that sojourn with thee; but for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be for food&#x27; (Le 25:6 f). This has been quoted at length because the rendering of English Versions of the Bible is misleading. &quot;The Sabbath of the land&quot; does not mean that the natural increase thereof is to be eaten by the Israelite peasant. That interpretation is excluded by Le 25:3-5,20-22. What is intended is clearly shown by the latter of these two passages, &quot;I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year.&quot; The principle on which the manna had been provided for Sabbaths was to apply to the harvest of the sixth year, and this is the import of the phrase.2. The Jubilee:After &quot;seven sabbaths of years, even forty and tone years&quot; a trumpet was to be blown throughout the land on the tenth day of the seventh month (i.e. the Day of Atonement) and the fiftieth year was to be hallowed and celebrated as a &quot;jubilee.&quot; No agricultural work of any kind was to be performed, but &quot;ye may (so correct EVV) eat the increase thereof out of the field&quot; (Le 25:12). God would so bless the land in the sixth year that it would bring forth enough for the Sabbath year, the ensuing jubilee and the subsequent period to the harvest of the ninth year (Le 25:20-22).3. Its Object:In addition to being a period in which the land was left fallow, the jubilee was intended to meet the economic evils that befell peasants in ancient societies. Wars or unfavorable seasons would soon reduce a farmer to a condition in which he would have to borrow. But money is rarely to be had without interest and security, and in early communities the rates of interest were very high indeed, while the only security the farmer could offer would consist of his land and the persons of himself and his children. Hence we find insolvency giving rise to the alienation of land and to slavery all over the world--sometimes with the retention of civil rights (as in Rome and Israel), at others in a more unalloyed form. The jubilee aims at both these evils. It is provided that in that year the peasants who had lost their full freedom through insolvency should be free (see Wiener, Studies in Biblical Law, 5 ff)...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-gre&#x27; (sumphoneo, &quot;to be of the same mind,&quot; &quot;to come to a mutual understanding&quot;): This is the sense of the word in Mt 20:2; Joh 9:22, and other passages. In Mr 14:56 the word is isos and has the thought not only that their words did not agree, but also that the testimony was not in agreement with or equal to what the law required in such a case. The thought of being equal occurs also in  1Joh 5:8.The figurative use of the word in Mt 18:19 makes it of special interest. The word there is sumphoneo, from which comes our word symphony, meaning a harmonious blending. This agreement therefore is complete. Three persons are introduced: two human beings and the Father. They are in perfect agreement on the subject or purpose under consideration. It is therefore an inward unity produced by the Holy Spirit leading the two into such an agreement with the Father. There will follow then, as a matter of course, what is promised in Mt 18:19,20. In Ac 5:9 it sets forth the justice of Peter in dealing in the same manner in both cases. Ananias and Sapphira were in perfect agreement and equally guilty (Lu 5:36; Ac 15:15).Jacob W. Kapp</p>

CLIMATIC CONDITIONS AND FERTILITYIII. AGRICULTURAL PURSUITS  1. Growing of Grain (1) Plowing and Sowing (2) Reaping (3) Threshing 2. Care of Vineyards 3. Raising of Flocks  I. Development of Agriculture.One may witness in Syria and Palestine today the various stages of social progress through which the people of Bible times passed in which the development of their agriculture played an important part. To the East the sons of Ishmael still wander in tribes from place to place, depending upon their animals for food and raiment, unless by a raid they can secure the fruits of the soil from the peoples, mostly of their own blood, who have given up wandering and are supporting themselves by tilling the ground. It is only a short step from this frontier life to the more protected territory toward the Mediterranean, where in comparatively peaceful surroundings, the wanderers become stationary. If the land which they have come to possess is barren and waterless, they become impoverished physically and spiritually, but if they have chosen the rarer spots where underground streams burst forth into valleys covered with alluvial deposits (Ex 3:8), they prosper and there springs up the more complicated community life with its servants, hirelings, gardeners, etc. A division of labor ensues. Some leave the soil for the crafts and professions but still depend upon their farmer neighbors for theft sustenance. (1Ki 5:11.) Such was the variety of life of the people among whom Jesus lived, and of their ancestors, and of the inhabitants of the land long before the children of Israel came to take possession of it. Bible history deals with the Hebrews at a period when a large proportion of that people were engaged in agrarian pursuits, hence we find its pages filled with references to agricultural occupations.II. Climatic Conditions and Fertility.With climatic conditions and fertility so varied, the mode of cultivation, seedtime and harvest differed even in closely adjacent territory. On the coastal plains and in the low Jordan valley the soil was usually rich and the season was early, whereas the mountainous regions and high interior plains the planting and reaping times were from two weeks to a month later. To make use of the soil on the hillsides, terracing was frequently necessary.Examples of these old terraces still exist. On the unwatered plains the crops could be grown only In the winter and spring, i.e. during the rainy season. These districts dried up in May or June and remained fallow during the rainless summer. The same was true of the hilly regions and valleys except where water from a stream could be diverted from its channel and spread over the fields. In such districts crops could be grown irrespective of the seasons. See IRRIGATION.III. Agricultural Pursuits.To appreciate the many references in the Bible to agricultural pursuits and the frequent allusions of our Lord to the fields and their...</p>

He takes an agnostic attitude toward God and transcendent things, and in general the range of his thought, as compared with that of other authors, is pedestrian. He shows, however, a tender reverence and awe. His most notable utterance, perhaps, is the celebrated Prayer of Agur (Pr 30:7-9), which gives expression to a charming golden mean of practical ideal. His sayings are constructed on a rather artificial plan; having the form of the so-called numerical proverb. See under PROVERBS, THE BOOK OF, II, 6.John Franklin Genung</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a, a-ha&#x27;: Interjections of frequent occurrence in the Old Testament, representing different Hebrew words and different states of feeling.(1) &#x27;ahah, expressing complaint and found in the phrase &quot;Ah, Lord Yahweh&quot; (Jer 1:6; 4:10 etc.; Eze 4:14 etc.). Elsewhere the word is translated &quot;alas!&quot; (Joe 1:15).(2) &#x27;ach, occurs once (Eze 21:15), expressing grief in contemplating Israel&#x27;s destruction.(3) he&#x27;ach, usually expresses malicious joy over the reverses of an enemy, and is introduced by the verb &quot;to say&quot; (Brown-Driver-Briggs&#x27; Lexicon); so in Ps 35:21,25; Eze 25:3; 26:2; 36:2; in the repeated Psalm 40:15; 70:3. It expresses satiety in Isa 44:16; and represents the neighing of a horse in Job 39:25.(4) hoy, expresses grief or pain, (Isa 1:4; Jer 22:18). In 1Ki 13:30 it is translated &quot;alas!&quot; More frequently it is used to indicate that a threat of judgment is to follow (Isa 10:5; 29:1); or to direct attention to some important announcement (Isa 55:1), where the Hebrew word is translated &quot;Ho.&quot;(5) Greek oua, in Mr 15:29, used by those who mocked Jesus, as He hung upon the cross. All of these words are evidently imitative of the natural sounds, which spontaneously give expression to these emotions of complaint, grief, pain, exultation, etc.Edward Mack</p>

Ahab&#x27;s Reign:Ahab, son of Omri, the seventh king of Israel, who reigned for twenty-two years, from 876 to 854 (1Ki 16:28 ff), was one of the strongest and at the same time one of the weakest kings of Israel. With his kingdom he inherited also the traditional enemies of the kingdom, who were no less ready to make trouble for him than for his predecessors. Occupying a critical position at the best, with foes ever ready to take advantage of any momentary weakness, the kingdom, during the reign of Ahab, was compelled to undergo the blighting effects of misfortune, drought and famine. But Ahab, equal to the occasion, was clever enough to win the admiration and respect of friend and foe, strengthening the kingdom without and within. Many of the evils of his reign, which a stronger nature might have overcome, were incident to the measures that he took for strengthening the kingdom.2. His Foreign Policy:In the days of David and Solomon a beneficial commercial intercourse existed between the Hebrews and the Phoenicians. Ahab, recognizing the advantages that would accrue to his kingdom from an alliance with the foremost commercial nation of his time, renewed the old relations with the Phoenicians and cemented them by his marriage with Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of Tyre (the Ithobalos, priest of Astarte mentioned by Meander). He next turns his attention to the establishment of peaceful and friendly relations with the kindred and neighboring kingdom of Judah. For the first time since the division of the kingdoms the hereditary internecine quarrels are forgotten, &quot;and Jehoshaphat,&quot; the good king of Judah, &quot;made peace with the king of Israel.&quot; This alliance, too, was sealed by a marriage relationship, Jehoram, the crown-prince of Judah, being united in marriage with the princess Athaliah, daughter of Ahab.Perhaps some additional light is thrown upon Ahab&#x27;s foreign policy by his treatment of Benhadad, king of Damascus. An opportunity was given to crush to dust the threatening power of Syria. But when Benhadad in the garb of a suppliant was compelled to sue for his life, Ahab received into kindly as his brother, and although denounced by the prophets for his leniency, spared his enemy and allowed him to depart on the condition that he would restore the cities captured from Omri, and concede certain &quot;streets&quot; in Damascus as a quarter for Israelite residents. No doubt Ahab thought that a king won as a friend by kindness might be of greater service to Israel than a hostile nation, made still more hostile, by having its king put to death. Whatever Ahab&#x27;s motives may have been, these hereditary foes really fought side by side against the common enemy, th...</p>

In Esther:There seems to be little reasonable doubt, that we should identify the Ahasuerus of Es with the well-known Xerxes, who reigned over Persia from 485 to 465 BC, and who made the great expedition against Greece that culminated in the defeat of the Persian forces at Salamis and Plataea. If Es be taken as equivalent to Ishtar, it may well be the same as the Amestris of Herodotus, which in Babylonian would be Ammi-Ishtar, or Ummi-Ishtar. Amestris is said to have been the daughter of Otanes, a distinguished general of Xerxes, and the grand-daughter of Sisamnes, a notorious judge, who was put to death with great cruelty by the king because of malfeasance in office. Sisamnes may be in Babylonian Shamash-ammanu-(shallim). If he were the brother and Otanes the nephew of Mordecai, we can easily account for the ease with which the latter and has ward Esther, were advanced and confirmed in their Positions at the court, of Xerxes.2. In Ezra:An Ahasuerus is mentioned in Ezr 4:6, as one to whom some persons unnamed wrote an accusation against Judah and Jerusalem. Ewald and others have suggested that this Ahasuerus was Cambyses, the son and successor of Cyrus. It seems to be more probable that Xerxes, the son and successor of Darius Hystaspis, is meant: first, because in the following verse Artaxerxes, the son and successor of Xerxes, is mentioned; and secondly, because we have no evidence whatever that Cambyses was ever called Ahasuerus, whereas there is absolute certainty that the Pets Khshayarsha, the Hebrew &#x27;achashwerosh, the Greek Assoueros or Xerxes, and the Latin Ahasuerus, are the exact equivalents of one another.3. In Tobit:In the apocryphal book of Tobit (14:15, the King James Version) it is said that before Tobias died he heard of the destruction of Nineveh, which was taken by Nabuchodonosor and Assuerus. This Assuerus can have been no other than Cyaxares, who according to Herodotus (i.196) took Nineveh and reduced the Assyrians into subjection, with the exception of the Babylonian district. As we shall see below, he was probably the same as the Ahasuerus of Da 9:1. The phrase &quot;which was taken by Nabuchodonosor and Assuerus&quot; is not found in the Syriac version of Tobit.4. In Daniel:An Ahasuerus is said in Da 9:1 to have been the father of Darius the Mede, and to have been of the seed of the Medes. It is probable that this Ahasuerus is the same as the Uvakhshatara of the Persian recension of the Behistun inscription, which in the Babylonian is Umaku&#x27;ishtar, in the Susian Makishtarra, and in Herod Cyaxares. It will be noted that both the Greek Cyaxares and the Hebrew Akhashwerosh omit the preformative uwa- and the &quot;t&quot; of the Persian form Uvakhshatara. That th...</p>

At this rendezvous the company encamped for three days to make preparation for the difficult and dangerous journey (Ezr 8:15 ff). On reviewing the people and the priests Ezra found no Levites among them; he therefore sent to Iddo, &quot;the chief at the place Casiphia,&quot; a request for ministers for the temple. A number of Levites with 220 Nethinim returned to the rendezvous with the deputation. Ezra had expressed to the king his faith in the protection of God; being, therefore, ashamed to ask for a military escort he proclaimed a fast to seek of God &quot;a straight way.&quot; To 12 priests Ezra assigned the care of the offering for the temple in Jerusalem. When all was ready the company &quot;departed from the river Ahava,&quot; and journeyed in safety to Jerusalem.This river, apparently called after a town or district toward which it flowed (Ezr 8:15), remains unidentified, though many conjectures have been made. Rawlinson thinks it is the &quot;Is&quot; of Herodotus (i.79), now called &quot;Hit,&quot; which flowed past a town of the same name in the Euphrates basin, 8 days&#x27; journey from Babylon. Some identify the district with &quot;Ivvah&quot; (2Ki 18:34, etc.). Most probably, however, this was one of the numerous canals which intersected Babylonia, flowing from the Euphrates toward a town or district &quot;Ahava.&quot; If so, identification is impossible.S.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a&#x27;-haz (&#x27;achaz, &quot;he has grasped,&quot; 2Ki 16; 2Ch 28; Isa 7:10 ff; Achaz).1. Name:The name is the same as Jehoahaz; hence appears on Tiglath-pileser&#x27;s Assyrian inscription of 732 BC as Ia-u-ha-zi. The sacred historians may have dropped the first part of the name in consequence of the character of the king.2. The Accession:Ahaz was the son of Jotham, king of Judah. He succeeded to the throne at the age of 20 years (according to another reading 25). The chronology of his reign is difficult, as his son Hezekiah is stated to have been 25 years of age when he began to reign 16 years after (2Ki 18:2). If the accession of Ahaz be placed as early as 743 BC, his grandfather Uzziah, long unable to perform the functions of his office on account of his leprosy (2Ch 26:21), must still have been alive. (Others date Ahaz later, when Uzziah, for whom Jotham had acted as regent, was already dead.)3. Early Idolatries:Although so young, Ahaz seems at once to have struck out an independent course wholly opposed to the religious traditions of his nation. His first steps in this direction were the causing to be made and circulated of molten images of the Baalim, and the revival in the valley of Hinnom, south of the city, of the abominations of the worship of Moloch (2Ch 28:2,3). He is declared to have made his own son &quot;pass through the fire&quot; (2Ki 16:3); the chronicler puts it even more strongly: he &quot;burnt his children in the fire&quot; (2Ch 28:3). Other acts of idolatry were to follow.4. Peril from Syria and Israel:The kingdom of Judah was at this time in serious peril. Rezin, king of Damascus, and Pekah, king of Samaria, had already, in the days of Jotham, begun to harass Judah (2Ki 15:37); now a conspiracy was formed to dethrone the young Ahaz, and set upon the throne a certain &quot;son of Tabeel&quot; (Isa 7:6). An advance of the two kings was made against Jerusalem, although without success (2Ki 16:5; Isa 7:1); the Jews were expelled from Elath (2Ki 16:6), and the country was ravaged, and large numbers taken captive (2Ch 28:5 ff). Consternation was universal. The heart of Ahaz &quot;trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind&quot; (Isa 7:2). In his extremity Ahaz appealed to the king of Assyria for help (2Ki 16:7; 2Ch 28:16).5. Isaiah&#x27;s Messages to the King:Amid the general alarm and perturbation, the one man untouched by it in Jerusalem was the prophet Isaiah. Undismayed, Isaiah set himself, apparently single-handed, to turn the tide of public opinion from the channel in which it was running, the seeking of aid from Assyria. His appeal was to both king and people. By Divine direction, meeting Ahaz &quot;at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller&#x27;s field,&quot; he bade him have no fear of &quot;these two tails of smoking firebrands,&quot; Rezin and Pekah, for, like dying torches, they would speedily be extinguished (Isa 7:3 ff). If he would not believe this he would not be established (Isa 7:9). Failing to win the young king&#x27;s confidenc...</p>

Ahaziah.Son of Ahab and Jezebel, eighth king of Israel (1Ki 22:51-2Ki 1:18).1. His Reign:Ahaziah became king over Israel in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and he reigned two years, 854-853 BC. There is, here an incongruity between the synchronism and the length of the reigns of the kings. Jehoshaphat began to reign in the fourth year of Ahab (1Ki 22:41), and he reigned 22 years (1Ki 16:29). Accordingly Ahaziah&#x27;s first year, in the twenty-second year of Ahab, would fall in the nineteenth year of Jehoshaphat. The chronological statement in 2Ki 1:17 is probably taken from the Syriac, and both are in harmony wrath a method of computation followed by certain Greek manuscripts.2. His Character:A good name does not insure a good character. Ahaziah, the &quot;God-sustained,&quot; served Baal and worshipped him, and provoked to anger Yahweh, the God of Israel, Just as his father before him had done. He appears to have been weak and unfortunate, and calamities in quick succession pursued him.3. The Revolt of Moab:Ahab had sought the good and became an enemy to the best. His house and the nation suffered the consequences. &quot;Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.&quot; Ahaziah appears to have been too weak to offer resistance. The Moabite Stone dates the revolt in the days of Ahab. No doubt it began at the time of Ahab&#x27;s last campaign against Syria.4. His Maritime Alliance:According to 1Ki 22:48 f Ahaziah attempted to form an alliance with Jehoshaphat of Judah to revive the ancient maritime traffic, but failed. According to 2Ch 20:35-37 the alliance was consummated, in consequence of which the enterprise came to nothing. See JEHOSHAPHAT.5. His Sickness and Death:Ahaziah suffered a severe accident by falling through the lattice in his upper apartment in Samaria, and lay sick. As a worthy son of Jezebel and Ahab, he sent messengers to consult Baalzebub, the god of Ekron, regarding his recovery. But Israel belonged to Yahweh. Accordingly the messengers were met by the prophet Elijah who for the last time warns against the corrupting moral influences of the Baal religion. &quot;Thus saith Yahweh, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die&quot; was the message which he sent back to the embassy, and the death of the king speedily followed.II. Ahaziah.Sixth king of Judah (2Ki 8:25-29; 9:16 f = 2Ch 22:1-9); also written Jehoahaz (2Ch 21:17; 25:23), which is merely a transposition of the component parts of the compound. The form &quot;Azariah&quot; (2Ch 22:6) is an error, fifteen Hebrew manuscripts and all the versions reading Ahaziah.1. His Brief Reign:Ahaziah, youngest son of Jehoram, began to reign in the twelfth year (2Ki 8:25) of Jehoram of Israel. In 2Ki 9:29 it is stated as the eleventh. The former is probably the Hebrew, the latter the Gree...</p>

Either he is the same with Ahimelech, who is mentioned later, or he is the father or brother of Ahimelech. He is introduced to us when Saul has been so long on the throne that his son Jonathan is a man grown and a warrior. He is in attendance upon Saul, evidently as an official priest, &quot;wearing an ephod.&quot; When Saul wishes direction from God he asks the priest to bring hither the ark; but then, without waiting for the message, Saul counts the confusion in the Philistine camp a sufficient indication of the will of Providence, and hurries off to the attack. Some copies of the Greek here read &quot;ephod&quot; instead of &quot;ark,&quot; but the documentary evidence in favor of that reading is far from decisive. If the Hebrew reading is correct, then the seclusion of the ark, from the time of its return from Philistia to the time of David, was not so absolute as many have supposed. See AHIMELECH, i.(4) One of David&#x27;s mighty men, according to the list in 1Ch 11:36. The corresponding name in the list in 2Sa 23:34 is Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite.(5) A Levite of David&#x27;s time who had charge of certain treasures connected with the house of God (1Ch 26:20). The Greek copies presuppose the slightly different text which would give in English &quot;and their brethren,&quot; instead of Ahijah. This is accepted by many scholars, and it is at least more plausible than most of the proposed corrections of the Hebrew text by the Greek.(6) Son of Sinsha and brother of Elihoreph (1Ki 4:3). The two brothers were scribes of Solomon. Can the scribes Ahijah and Shemaiah (1Ch 24:6) be identified with the men of the same names who, later, were known as distinguished prophets? Sinsha is probably the same with Shavsha (1Ch 18:16; compare 2Sa 8:17; 20:25), who was scribe under David, the office in this case descending from father to son.(7) The distinguished prophet of Shiloh, who was interested in Jeroboam I. In Solomon&#x27;s lifetime Ahijah clothed himself with a new robe, met Jeroboam outside Jerusalem, tore the robe into twelve pieces, and gave him ten, in token that he should become king of the ten tribes (1Ki 11:29-39). Later, when Jeroboam had proved unfaithful to Yahweh, he sent his wife to Ahijah to ask in regard to their sick son. The prophet received her harshly, foretold the death of the son, and threatened the extermination of the house of Jeroboam (1Ki 14). The narrative makes the impression that Ahijah was at this time a very old man (1Ki 14:4). These incidents are differently narrated in the long addition at 1Ki 12:24 found in some of the Greek copies. In that addition the account of the sick boy precedes that of the rent garment, and both are place...</p>

He was the son of Shaphan, who very likely is to be identified with Shaphan the scribe, who was at that time so prominent. Ahikam was the father of Gedaliah, whom, on the capture of Jerusalem, Nebuchadnezzar made governor of the land. Ahikam was a member of the deputation sent by Josiah to the prophetess Huldah to consult her concerning the contents of the Book of the Law which had been found. Under Jehoiakim he had sufficient influence to protect Jeremiah from being put to death. On the capture of Jerusalem Nebuchadnezzar committed Jeremiah into the care of Gedaliah. It is clear that both Shaphan and his son, like Jeremiah, belonged to the party which held that the men of Judah were under obligation to keep the oath which they had sworn to the tang of Babylon.Willis J.

With his father he remained loyal to David in the rebellions both of Absalom and of Adonijah. With Jonathan the son of Abiathar he carried information to Dared when he fled from Absalom (2Sa 15:27,36; 17:17,20). At his own urgent request he carried tidings to David after the death of Absalom (2Sa 18:19 ff). He told the king of the victory, and also, through his reluctance to speak, informed him of Absalom&#x27;s death. By his reluctance and his sympathy he softened a little the message, which the Cushite presently repeated more harshly.That Ahimaaz did not succeed his father as high priest has been inferred from the fact that in the Solomon list of heads of departments (1Ki 4:2) Azariah the son of Zadok is mentioned as priest. It is assumed that this Azariah is the one who appears in the genealogy as the son of Ahimaaz, and that for some reason Ahimaaz was left out of the succession. These inferences are not Justified by the record, though possibly the record does not absolutely disprove them. As the list stands it makes Zadok and Abiathar the high priests. Azariah and Zabud, the son of Nathan (1Ki 4:2,5), are spoken of as holding priestly offices of a different kind. Ahimaaz may have died early, or may have followed some other career, but the simple fact is that we do not know.(3) Ahimaaz, in Naphtali, was one of Solomon&#x27;s twelve commissary officers (1Ki 4:15), who married Basemath the daughter of Solomon. It is not impossible that he was Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, though there is no proof to that effect.Willis J. Beecher</p>

The three names (Ahiman, Sheshai, Talmai) also occur together in Jud 1:10. The word Anak in the Hebrew Bible has the definite article except in Nu 13:33 and De 9:2. Its use is that of a common noun denoting a certain type of man, rather than as the proper name of a person or a clan, though this need not prevent our thinking of the Anakim as a clan or group of clans, who regarded Arba as their founder. The question is raised whether Ahiman and Sheshai and Talmai are to be thought of as persons or as clans. The most natural understanding of the Bible statements is certainly to the effect that they were personal leaders among the Anakim of Kiriath-arba (Hebron). They were smitten and dispossessed by the tribe of Judah, with Caleb for leader.(2) A Levite, one of the gatekeepers of the latest Bible times (1Ch 9:17).

Ahijah the son of Ahitub (1Sa 14:3,18) was either the same person under another name, or was Ahimelech&#x27;s father or brother. See AHIJAH, 3. Ahimelech is an interesting person, especially because he stands for whatever information we have concerning the priestly office in Israel during the period between Eli and David. Whether the Deuteronomic law for a central sanctuary originated with Moses or not, its provisions were very imperfectly carried out during the times of the Judges. This was particularly the case after the capture of the ark by the Philistines, and the deaths of Eli and his sons. From that time to the middle of the reign of David the ark was in the custody of the men of Kiriath-jearim &quot;in the hill,&quot; or &quot;in Gibeah&quot; (1Sa 7:1; 2Sa 6:2,3).As a general proposition Israel &quot;sought not unto it&quot; (1Ch 13:3), though there is nothing to forbid the idea that it may, on occasion, have been brought out from its seclusion (1Sa 14:18). Before and after the accession of Saul some of the functions of the national sanctuary were transacted, of course very incompletely, at Gilgal (1Sa 10:8; 11:14,15; 13:7; 15:12,21,33). Whether there was a priesthood, with Ahitub the grandson of Eli as high priest, is a matter on which we have no information; but we may remind ourselves that the common assumption that such men as Samuel and Saul performed priestly offices is nothing but an assumption. After Saul has been king for a good many years we find Ahijah in his retinue, acting as priest and wearing priestly vestments. A few years later Ahimelech is at the head of the very considerable priestly establishment at Nob. The scale on which it existed is indicated by the fact that 85 robed priests perished in the massacre (1Sa 22:18).They had families residing at Nob (1Sa 22:19). They were thought of as priests of Yahweh, and were held in reverence (1Sa 22:17). It was a hereditary priesthood (1Sa 22:11,15). Men deposited votive offerings there, the sword of Goliath, for example (1Sa 21:9). There seems to have been some kind of police authority, whereby a person might be &quot;detained&quot; (1Sa 21:7). It was customary to inquire of Yahweh there (1Sa 22:10,15). A distraction was made between the common and the holy (1Sa 21:4-6). The custom of the shewbread was maintained (1Sa 21:6). In fine, Jesus is critically correct in calling the place &quot;the house of God&quot; (Mr 2:26). The account does not say that the ark was there, or that the burnt-offering of the morning and evening was offered, or that the great festivals were held. The priestly head of the establishment at Nob is represented to have been the man who had the right to the office through his descent from Aaron. It is gratuitous to assume that there were other similar sanctuaries in Israel, though th...</p>

She and Abigail, the widow of Nabal, seem to have been David&#x27;s only wives prior to the beginning of his reign in Hebron. His marriage to Abigail is mentioned first, with some details, followed by the statement, easily to be understood in the pluperfect, that he had previously married Ahinoam (1Sa 25:39-44). Three times they are mentioned together, Ahinoam always first (1Sa 27:3; 30:5; 2Sa 2:2), and Ahinoam is the mother of David&#x27;s first son and Abigail of his second (2Sa 3:2; 1Ch 3:1). Ahinoam&#x27;s son was Amnon. The record really represents David&#x27;s polygamy as a series of bids for political influence; the names of Amnon, Absalom, Adonijah suggest that the method was not finally a success.Willis J.

The word is always treated as a common noun in the ordinary Greek copies, being rendered either &quot;brother&quot; or &quot;brothers,&quot; or &quot;his brother&quot; or &quot;his brothers&quot;; but this is probably to be taken as an instance of the relative inferiority of the Greek text as compared with the Massoretic Text. See OSTRACA.(1) One of the sons of Beriah, the son of Elpaal, the son of Shaharaim and Hushim, reckoned among the families of Benjamin (1Ch 8:14). Beriah and Shema are described as `ancestral heads&#x27; &quot;of the inhabitants of Aijalon, who put to flight the inhabitants of Gath.&quot;(2) A descendant of Jeiel (&quot;the father of Gibeon&quot;) and his wife Maacah (1Ch 8:31; 9:37). King Saul apparently came from the same family (1Ch 8:30,33; 9:39).(3) One of the men who drove the new cart when David first attempted to bring the ark from the house of Abinadab to Jerusalem (2Sa 6:3,4; 1Ch 13:7). In Samuel Uzza and Ahio are called sons of Abinadab. By the most natural understanding of the Biblical data about 100 years had elapsed since the ark was brought to the house; they were sons of that Abinadab in the sense of being his descendants. Whether he had a successor of the same name living in David&#x27;s time is a matter of conjecture.Willis J. Beecher</p>

In 1Ch 8:1 five sons are likewise mentioned, being explicitly numbered; the third name, Aharah (&#x27;achrach), is conjectured to be either a corruption of Ahiram or a different name for the same person.

He is described as &quot;the king&#x27;s counselor,&quot; in a context connected with events some of which are dated in the fortieth year of David (1Ch 27:33,34; compare 1Ch 26:31). Concerning him and his part in the rebellion we have rather full information (2Sa 15:12 ff).Some hold that he was the grandfather of Bathsheba, and make much of this in forming their estimates of him. Does the evidence sustain this view? In the latter half of the list of David&#x27;s mighty men, not among the older veterans with whom the list begins, appears &quot;Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite&quot; (2Sa 23:34), the corresponding name in the other copy of the list being &quot;Ahijah the Pelonite&quot; (1Ch 11:36). It is assumed that this is the same Eliam who was father to Bath-sheba (2Sa 11:3). Apparently the Chronicler testifies (1Ch 3:5) that the mother of Solomon was &quot;Bath-shua the daughter of Ammiel.&quot;Bathshua may easily be a variant of Bathsheba, and the names Eliam and Ammiel are made up of the same parts, only in reversed order. It is not strange that men have inferred that the son of Ahithophel was the father of Bathsheba. But the inference is really not a probable one. The record does not make the impression that Ahithophel was an older man than David. The recorded events of David&#x27;s life after his misconduct with Bathsheba cannot have occupied less than about twenty years; that is, he cannot have been at the time older than about fifty years. That Ahithophel had then a married grand-daughter is less probable than that there were in Israel two Eliams. Further, Ahithophel was not the sort of man to conspire against the interests of his grand-daughter and her son, however he may, earlier, have resented the conduct of David toward her. Ahithophel&#x27;s motive in the rebellion was doubtless ambition for personal power, though he very likely shared with many of his countrymen in the conviction that it was unjust to push aside an older son by elevating a younger son to the throne.Ahithophel has a reputation for marvelous practical sagacity (2Sa 16:23). He did not show this in joining the conspiracy but it is in evidence in his management of the affair. According to the record the hearts of the people, in spite of the much fault they had to find, were all the time with David. Absalom&#x27;s only chance of success was by the method of surprise and stampede. There must be a crisis in which everybody would join Absalom because everybody thought that everybody else had done so. Such a state of public sentiment could last only a very few days; but if, in those few days, David could be put out of the way, Absalom might hold the throne in virtue of his personal popularity and in default of a rival. The first part of the program was carried out with wonderful success; when it came to the second part, Ahithophel&#x27;s practical wisdom was blocked by Hushai&#x27;s adroit appeal to Absalom&#x27;s personal vani...</p>

The record implies that he was born while his father and grandfather were priests at Shiloh, and it says that he was the father and grandfather of priests; but it is silent as to his own exercise of the priestly office. We have no information concerning the office from the time when the Philistines captured the ark till Saul became king. See AHIJAH; AHIMELECH; ABIATHAR.(2) A descendant of Aaron through Eleazar: by this fact distinguished from Ahitub, the descendant of Ithamar, though nearly contemporaneous with him. Especially known as the father of Zadok who, at Solomon&#x27;s accession, became sole high priest (2Sa 8:17; 1Ch 6:8; 18:16). His genealogical line, from Levi to the Exile, is given in 1Ch 6:1-15. The three successive names, Ahitub and Zadok and Ahimaaz, appear in 2Sa 8:17; 15:27, etc.. The line is paralleled by selected names in Ezr 7:1-5, and relatively late parts of it are paralleled in 1Ch 9:11 and Ne 11:11. The best explanation of certain phenomena in Chronicles is that the record was copied from originals that were more or less fragmentary. In some cases, also, a writer gives only such parts of a genealogy as are needed for his purpose. It is due to these causes that there are many omissions in the genealogical lists, and that they supplement one another. Allowing for these facts there is no reason why we should not regard the genealogies of Ahitub as having distract historical value.(3) In the genealogies, in the seventh generation from Ahitub, the descendant of Eleazar, appears another Ahitub, the son of another Amariah and the father (or grandfather) of another Zadok (1Ch 6:11; 9:11, Ne 11:11). The list in Ezr 7 omits a block of names, and the Ahitub there named may be either 2 or 3. He is mentioned in 1 Esdras 8:2 and 2 Esdras 1:1, and the name occurs in Judith 8:1. In these places it appears in the English versions in the various forms: Ahitub, Ahitob, Achitob, Acitho.Willis J. Beecher</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a&#x27;-i (`ay, written always with the definite article, ha-`ay, probably meaning &quot;the ruin,&quot; kindred root, `awah):(1) A town of central Palestine, in the tribe of Benjamin, near and just east of Bethel (Ge 12:8). It is identified with the modern Haiyan, just south of the village Der Diwan (Conder in HDB; Delitzsch in Commentary on Ge 12:8) or with a mound, El-Tell, to the north of the modern village (Davis, Dict. Biblical). The name first appears in the earliest journey of Abraham through Palestine (Ge 12:8), where its location is given as east of Bethel, and near the altar which Abraham built between the two places. It is given similar mention as he returns from his sojourn in Egypt (Ge 13:3). In both of these occurrences the King James Version has the form Hai, including the article in transliterating. The most conspicuous mention of Ai is in the narrative of the Conquest. As a consequence of the sin of Achan in appropriating articles from the devoted spoil of Jericho, the Israelites were routed in the attack upon the town; but after confession and expiation, a second assault was successful, the city was taken and burned, and left a heap of ruins, the inhabitants, in number twelve thousand, were put to death, the king captured, hanged and buried under a heap of stones at the gate of the ruined city, only the cattle being kept as spoil by the people (Jos 7; 8). The town had not been rebuilt when Jos was written (Jos 8:28). The fall of Ai gave the Israelites entrance to the heart of Canaan, where at once they became established, Bethel and other towns in the vicinity seeming to have yielded without a struggle. Ai was rebuilt at some later period, and is mentioned by Isa (Isa 10:28) in his vivid description of the approach of the Assyrian army, the feminine form (`ayyath) being used. Its place in the order of march, as just beyond Michmash from Jerusalem, corresponds with the identification given above. It is mentioned also in post-exilic times by Ezr 2:28 and Ne 7:32, (and in Ne 11:31 as, `ayya&#x27;), identified in each case by the grouping with Bethel.(2) The Ai of Jer 49:3 is an Ammonite town, the text probably being a corruption of `ar; or ha-`ir, &quot;the city&quot; (BDB).Edward Mack</p>

The first mention of Aijalon is in the narrative of Joshua&#x27;s defeat of the five Amorite kings: &quot;thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon&quot; (Jos 10:12). The Danites failed to take it from the Amorites (Jud 1:35), although the men of Ephraim held it in vassalage. Here Saul and Jonathan won a great victory over the Philistines (1Sa 14:31). At one time it was held by the tribe of Benjamin (1Ch 8:13). Rehoboam fortified it against the kingdom of Israel (2Ch 11:10). In the days of King Ahaz it was captured by the Philistines (2Ch 28:18). It has been identified with the modern Yalo; its antiquity goes back to Tell el-Amarna Letters, in which it has mention. It Is situated Northwest of Jerusalem in a valley of the same name, which leads down from the mountains to the sea.(2) A town in the tribe of Zebulun, site unknown, where Elon the judge was buried (Jud 12:12).Edward Mack</p>

Thomson and after him Robinson make Ain the same as `Ain el-`Asy, the chief source of the Orontes, some fifteen miles Southwest of Riblah, which, in turn, is about twenty miles Southwest of Emesa (Hums). As Ain is named in connection with Lake Gennesaret, some claim that Riblah of Nu 34:11 must be another place farther South and closer to that lake.(2) A Levitical city (Jos 21:16) in the Negeb or southern part of Judah. It was first allotted to the tribe of Judah (Jos 15:32) but later to Simeon (Jos 19:7). The fact that it is several times named in immediate connection with Rimmon has lent plausibility to the view that we have here a compound word, and that we should read En-Rimmon, i.e. Ain-Rimmon (see Jos 15:32; 19:7; 1Ch 4:32).

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ar (aer): In the Old Testament &quot;air&quot; is used (with one exception) in the phrase &quot;fowl&quot; or &quot;fowls (birds) of the air.&quot; The Hebrew word is usually rendered &quot;heaven&quot; or &quot;heavens.&quot; According to ancient Hebrew cosmogony the sky was a solid dome (firmament) stretching over the earth as a covering. In the above phrase the air means the space between the earth and the firmament. In Job 41:16 &quot;air&quot; renders ruach, &quot;breath,&quot; &quot;wind,&quot; &quot;spirit.&quot; The scales of the leviathan are so closely joined together that no air can penetrate. In the New Testament the phrase &quot;birds (or fowls) of the air,&quot; occurs ten times. This simply reproduces the Hebraism noticed above. Apart from this expression &quot;air&quot; in the King James Version represents aer, which denotes the atmosphere which surrounds us. The expression &quot;beating the air&quot; (1Co 9:26) means to &quot;deal blows that do not get home&quot;--that miss the mark. In his conflict with the lower life represented by the body, Paul compares himself to a boxer who aims with unerring accuracy at his opponent. No stroke is lost. Paul also uses the phrase &quot;speaking into the air&quot; (1Co 14:9) in reference to the unintelligible utterances of those who &quot;spake with tongues.&quot; In the expression, &quot;prince of the powers of the air&quot; (Eph 2:2 the King James Version) we find an echo of the current belief that the air was the dwelling place of spirits, especially of evil spirits.Thomas Lewis</p>

Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.&quot; Doubtless it was a supposed connection between this potter&#x27;s field and the potter&#x27;s house (Jer 18:2) and the Valley of the Son of Hinnom (Jer 19:2) which influenced the selection of the present site which, like the Aramaic h-q-l-d-m-&#x27; (Dalman), is today known as haqq-ed-dumm, &quot;field of blood.&quot;Tradition, which appears to go back to the 4th century, points to a level platform on, and some distance up, the southern slope of the Wady er Rababi (Valley of Hinnom) just before it joins the Kidron Valley. Upon this spot there is a very remarkable ruin (78 ft. x 57 ft.) which for many centuries was used as a charnel house. The earth here was reputed to have the property of quickly consuming dead bodies. So great was its reputation that vast quantities of it are said to have been transported in 1215 AD to the Campo Santo at Pisa.When this building was standing entire, the bodies were lowered into it through five openings in the roof and then left to disintegrate, so that a few years ago there were very many feet of bones all over the floor. These have now been removed. A little Southeast of this ruin is a new Greek monastery erected in recent years over the remains of a large number of cave tombs; many of the bones from &quot;Akeldama&quot; are now buried here.E.

In a few instances it is employed of a cry of despair or distress. The noun teru`ah translated &quot;alarm&quot; in Nu 10:5 f refers to the signal given the people of Israel to start on their journey in the Wilderness. The passages in Jer (4:19; 49:2) both refer to the summons for war. The same is true of Ze 1:16. The law concerning the sounding of the alarm is fully stated in Nu 10:1-10. Here we read that two silver trumpets of beaten work were sounded by the sons of Aaron in case of war and also &quot;in the day of .... gladness&quot; to gather the people together for the various feasts, new moons, sacrifices and offerings.W.

He was a descendant of Aaron, but not in the high-priestly line (1 Macc 7:14; also Ant, XX, 10); and being ambitious for the office of high priest, he hastened to Antioch to secure the favor and help of the new king, Demetrius, who had just overthrown Antiochus Eupator and made himself king. Alcimus was of the Grecianizing party, and therefore bitterly opposed by the Maccabees. Demetrius sent a strong army under Bacchides to establish him in the high-priesthood at Jerusalem. The favor with which Alcimus was received by the Jews at Jerusalem on account of his Aaronic descent was soon turned to hate by his cruelties. When Bacchides and his army returned to Antioch, Simon Maccabeus attacked and overcame Alcimus, and drove him also to Syria. There he secured from Demetrius another army, led by Nicanor, who, failing to secure Simon by treachery, joined battle with him, but was defeated and killed. A third and greater army, under Bacchides again, was dispatched to save the falling fortunes of Alcimus. Now Simon was overwhelmed and slain, Alcimus established as high priest and a strong force left in Jerusalem to uphold him. But he did not long enjoy his triumph, since he died soon after from a paralytic stroke.Edward Mack</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">al-eg-zan&#x27;-der Alexandros, literal meaning &quot;defender of men.&quot; This word occurs five times in the New Testament, (Mr 15:21; Ac 4:6; 19:33; 1Ti 1:19,20, 2Ti 4:14): It is not certain whether the third, fourth and fifth of these passages refer to the same man.1. A Son of Simon of Cyrene:The first of these Alexanders is referred to in the passage in Mk, where he is said to have been one of the sons of Simon of Cyrene, the man who carried the cross of Christ. Alexander therefore may have been a North African by birth. Matthew, Mark, and Luke all record the fact, with varying detail, that Simon happened to be passing at the time when Christ was being led out of the city, to be crucified on Calvary. Mark alone tells that Simon was the father of Alexander and Rufus. From this statement of the evangelist, it is apparent that at the time the Second Gospel was written, Alexander and Rufus were Christians, and that they were well known in the Christian community. Mark takes it for granted that the first readers of his Gospel will at once understand whom he means.There is no other mention of Alexander in the New Testament, but it is usually thought that his brother Rufus is the person mentioned by Paul in Ro 16:13, &quot;Salute Rufus the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.&quot; If this identification is correct, then it follows, not only that the sons of Simon were Christians, but that his wife also was a Christian, and that they had all continued faithful to Christ for many years. It would also follow that the households were among the intimate friends of Paul, so much so that the mother of the family is affectionately addressed by him as &quot;Rufus&#x27; mother and mine.&quot; The meaning of this is, that in time past this lady had treated Paul with the tender care which a mother feels and shows to her own son.This mention of Rufus and his mother is in the list of names of Christians resident in Rome. Lightfoot (Comm. on Phil, 176) writes: &quot;There seems no reason to doubt the tradition that Mr wrote especially for the Romans; and if so, it is worth remarking that he alone of the evangelists describes Simon of Cyrene, as `the father of Alexander and Rufus.&#x27; A person of this name therefore (Rufus) seems to have held a prominent place among the Roman Christians; and thus there is at least fair ground for identifying the Rufus of Paul with the Rufus of Mark. The inscriptions exhibit several members of the household (of the emperor) bearing the names Rufus and Alexander, but this fact is of no value where both names are so common.&quot;To sum up, Alexander was probably by birth a North African Jew; he became a Christian, and was a well-known member of the church, probably the church in Rome. His chief claim to recollection is that he was a son of the man who carried the cross of the Saviour of the world.2. A Relative of Annas:The second Alexander, referred to in Ac 4:6, was a relative of Annas the Jewish high priest. He is mentioned by Lk, as having been present as a member of the S...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">Alexander ba&#x27;-las (Alexandros ho Balas legomenos): He contended against Demetrius I of Syria for the throne and succeeded in obtaining it. He was a youth of mean origin, but he was put forth by the enemies of Demetrius as being Alexander, the son and heir of Antiochus Epiphanes. He received the support of the Roman Senate and of Ptolemy VI of Egypt, and on account of the tyranny of Demetrius, was favored by many of the Syrians. The country was thrown into civil war and Demetrius was defeated by Alexander II took up the cause of his father and in 147 BC, Alexander fled from his kingdom and was soon after assassinated.Our chief interest in Alexander is his connection with the Maccabees. Jonathan was the leader of the Maccabean forces and both Alexander and Demetrius sought his aid. Demetrius granted Jonathan the right to raise and maintain an army. Alexander, not to be outdone, appointed Jonathan high priest, and as a token of his new office sent him a purple robe and a diadem (Ant., XIII, ii, 2). This was an important step in the rise of the Maccabean house, for it insured them the support of the Chasidim. In 153 BC, Jonathan officiated as high priest at the altar (1 Macc 10:1-14; Ant, XIII, ii, 1). This made him the legal head of Judea and thus the movement of the Maccabees became closely identified with Judaism. In 1 Macc 10:1, he is called Alexander Epiphanes.A. W. Fortune</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(Alexandros).  1. Parentage and Early Life:Alexander, of Macedon, commonly called &quot;the Great&quot; (born 356 BC), was the son of Philip, king of Macedon, and of Olympias, daughter of Neoptolemos, an Epeirote king. Although Alexander is not mentioned by name in the canonical Scriptures, in Da he is designated by a transparent symbol (8:5,21). In 1 Macc 1:1 he is expressly named as the overthrower of the Persian empire, and the founder of that of the Greeks. As with Frederick the Great, the career of Alexander would have been impossible had his father been other than he was. Philip had been for some years a hostage in Thebes: while there he had learned to appreciate the changes introduced into military discipline and tactics by Epaminondas. Partly no doubt from the family claim to Heracleid descent, deepened by contact in earlier days with Athenians like Iphicrates, and the personal influence of Epaminondas, Philip seems to have united to his admiration for Greek tactics a tincture of Hellenistic culture, and something like a reverence for Athens, the great center of this culture. In military matters his admiration led him to introduce the Theban discipline to the rough peasant levies of Macedon, and the Macedonian phalanx proved the most formidable military weapon that had yet been devised. The veneer of Greek culture which he had taken on led him, on the one hand, laying stress on his Hellenistic descent, to claim admission to the comity of Hellas, and on the other, to appoint Aristotle to be a tutor to his son. By a combination of force and fraud, favored by circumstances, Philip got himself appointed generalissimo of the Hellenistic states; and further induced them to proclaim war against the &quot;Great King.&quot; In all this he was preparing the way for his son, so soon to be his successor.2. His Preparation for His Career:He was also preparing his son for his career. Alexander was, partly no doubt from being the pupil of Aristotle, yet more imbued with Greek feelings and ideas than was Preparation his father. He was early introduced into the cares of government and the practice of war. While Philip was engaged in the siege of Byzantium he sent his son to replace Antipater in the regency; during his occupancy of this post, Alexander, then only a youth of sixteen, had to undertake a campaign against the Illyrians, probably a punitive expedition. Two years later, at the decisive battle of Chaeroneia, which fixed the doom of the Greek autonomous city, Alexander commanded the feudal cavalry of Macedon, the &quot;Companions.&quot; He not only saved his father&#x27;s life, but by his timely and vehement charge materially contributed to the victory.3. His Accession to the Hegemony of Greece:When all his plans for the invasion of Persia were complete, and a portion of his troops was already across the Hellespont, Philip was assassinated. Having secured his succession, Alexander proceeded to Corinth, where he was confirmed in his father&#x27;s position of leader of Hellas against Dari...</p>

History:In 331 BC, Alexander the Great, on his way to visit the Oracle of Amon seeking divine honors, stopped at the West extremity of the Delta at the isle of Pharos the landing-place of Odysseus (Od. iv.35) His keen eye noted the strategic possibilities of the site occupied by the little Egyptian village of Rhacotis, and his decision was immediate to erect here, where it would command the gateway to the richest domain of his empire, a glorious city to be called by his own name. Deinocrates, greatest living architect, already famous as builder of the Temple of Diana, was given free hand and like a dream the most beautiful city of the ancient or modern world (with the single exception of Rome) arose with straight, parallel streets--one at least 200 feet wide--with fortresses, monuments, palaces, government buildings and parks all erected according to a perfect artistic plan. The city was about fifteen miles in circumference (Pliny), and when looked at from above represented a Macedonian cloak, such as was worn by Alexander&#x27;s heroic ancestors. A colossal mole joined the island to the main land and made a double harbor, the best in all Egypt.Before Alexander died (323 BC) the future of the city as the commercial metropolis of the world was assured and here the golden casket of the conqueror was placed in a fitting mausoleum. Under the protection of the first two Ptolemies and Euergetes Alexandria reached its highest prosperity, receiving through Lake Mareotis the products of Upper Egypt, reaching by the Great Sea all the wealth of the West, while through the Red Sea its merchant vessels brought all the treasures of India and Arabia into the Alexandria docks without once being unladen.The manufactories of Alexandria were extensive, the greatest industry however being shipbuilding, the largest merchant ships of the world and battleships capable of carrying 1,000 men, which could hurl fire with fearful effect, being constructed here. This position of supremacy was maintained during the Roman domination up to the 5th century during which Alexandria began to decline. Yet even when Alexandria was captured by the Arabs (641) under the caliph Omar, the general could report: &quot;I have taken a city containing 4,000 palaces and 4,000 baths and 400 theaters.&quot; They called it a &quot;city of marble&quot; and believed the colossal obelisks, standing on crabs of crystal, and the Pharos, that white stone tower 400 ft. high, &quot;wonder of the world,&quot; to be the creation of jinn, not of men. With oriental exaggeration they declared that one amphitheater could easily hold a million spectators and that it was positively painful to go upon the streets at night because of the glare of light reflected from the white palaces. But with the coming of the Arabs Alexandria began to decline. It sank lower when Cairo became the capital (circa 1000 AD), and received its death blow when a sea route to India was discovered by way of the Cape of Good Hope (circa...</p>

They cover all life, including soul and spirit, although primarily referring to physical vitality. Striking examples may be cited: &quot;Is your father yet alive?&quot; (Ge 43:7); &quot;To whom he also showed himself alive&quot; (Ac 1:3). Often used of God: &quot;the living God&quot; (Jos 3:10); also of the resurrection life: &quot;In Christ shall all be made alive&quot; (1Co 15:22); of the soul&#x27;s regenerate life: &quot;Reckon .... yourselves .... alive unto God,&quot; &quot;as those that are alive from the dead&quot; (Ro 6:11:13 the King James Version). The term is vital with the creative energy of God; the healing, redemptive, resurrection life of Christ; the renewing and recreative power of the Holy Spirit.  Dwight M. Pratt</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">al&#x27;-e-go-ri: The term allegory, being derived from allo agoreuein, signifying to say something different from what the words themselves imply, can etymologically be applied to any figurative form of expression of thought. In actual usage in theology, the term is employed in a restricted sense, being used however in three ways, namely, rhetorically, hermeneutically and homiletically. In the first-mentioned sense it is the ordinary allegory of rhetoric, which is usually defined as an extended or continued metaphor, this extension expanding from two or more statements to a whole volume, like Bunyan&#x27;s Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress. Allegories of this character abound in the Scriptures, both in Old Testament and in New Testament. Instructive examples of this kind are found in Ps 80:8-19; Ec 12:3-7; Joh 10:1-16; Eph 6:11-17. According to traditional interpretation of both the Jewish exegesis and of the Catholic and Protestant churches the entire book of Canticles is such an allegory. The subject is discussed in full in Terry&#x27;s Biblical Hermeneutics, etc., chapter vii, 214-38.In the history of Biblical exegesis allegory represents a distinct type of interpretation, dating back to pre-Christian times, practiced particularly by the Alexandrian Jews, and adopted by the early Church Fathers and still practiced and defended by the Roman Catholic church. This method insists that the literal sense, particularly of historical passages, does not exhaust the divinely purposed meaning of such passages, but that these latter also include a deeper and higher spiritual and mystical sense. The fourfold sense ascribed to the Scriptures finds its expression in the well-known saying: Littera gesta docet; quid credas, allegorica; moralis, quid agas, quid speres, anagogica (&quot;The letter shows things done; what you are to believe, the allegoric; what you are to do, the moral; what you are to hope, the anagogic&quot;), according to which the allegorical is the hidden dogmatical meaning to be found in every passage.Cremer, in his Biblico-Theological New Testament Lexicon, shows that this method of finding a hidden thought behind the simple statement of a passage, although practiced so extensively on the Jewish side by Aristobulus and especially Philo, is not of Jewish origin, but was, particularly by the latter, taken from the Alexandrian Greeks (who before this had interpreted Greek mythology as the expression of higher religious conceptions) and applied to a deeper explanation of Old Testament historical data, together with its theophanies, anthropomorphisms, anthropopathies, and the like, which in their plain meaning were regarded as unworthy of a place in the Divine revelation of the Scriptures. Such allegorizing became the common custom of the early Christian church, although not practiced to the same extent in all sections, the Syrian church exhibiting the greatest degree of sobriety in this respect. In this only Jewish precedent was followed; the paraphrases commonly known as the Targu...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-li&#x27;-ans. 1. In the Patriarchal Stories:Frequent references are made to alliances between the patriarchs and foreigners. Abraham is reported to have had &quot;confederates&quot; among the chiefs of the Canaanites (Ge 14:13). He also allied with Abimelech, king of Gerar (Ge 21:22-34). Isaac&#x27;s alliance with Abimelech (Ge 26:26-34), which is offered as an explanation of the name Beer-sheba (Ge 26:33), appears to be a variant of the record of alliance between Abraham and Abimelech. Jacob formed an alliance with Laban, the Syrian (Ge 31:44-54), by which Gilead was established as a boundary line between Israel and Aramaic. These treaties refer, in all probability, to the early period of Israel&#x27;s history, and throw a good deal of light upon the relation between Israel and the Philistines and the Syrians immediately after the conquest of Canaan.2. In Pre-Canaanitic History:The only reference to an alliance between Israel and foreign people prior to the conquest of Canaan, that might be regarded as historical, is that made between Israel and the Kenite tribes at the foot of Sinai, the precise nature of which, however, is not very clearly indicated. Such alliances led to intermarriages between the members of the allied tribes. Thus Moses married a Kenite woman (Jud 1:16; 4:11). The patriarchal marriages refer to the existing conditions after the conquest. Possibly one more alliance belonging to that period is that between Israel and Moab (Nu 25:1-3). According to the narrative, Israel became attached to the daughters of Moab, at Shittim, and was led astray after Baal-peor. Its historicity is proven from the prophetic allusions to this event (compare Ho 9:10; Mic 6:5).3. During the Conquest:The invading hordes of Israel met with strong opposition on the part of the natives of Palestine (Jud 1:21,27-36). In time, alliances were formed with some of them, which generally led, as might be expected, to considerable trouble. One concrete illustration is preserved in the story of the Gibeonites (Jos 9). Intermarriages were frequent. The tribe of Judah thus became consolidated through the alliance and the amalgamation with the Kenites and Calebites (Jud 1:10-16). These relations between Israel and the Canaanites threatened the preservation of Yahwism.4. The Monarchy:Prohibitory measures were adopted in the legal codes with a view to Jewish separateness and purity (Ex 23:32; 34:12,15; De 7:2; compare Jud 2:2,3; Le 18:3,4; 20:22 f).But at a very early date in the history of the Jewish kingdom the official heads of the people formed such alliances and intermarried. David became an ally to Achish of Gath (1Sa 27:2-12) and later on with Abner, which led to the consolidation of Judah and Israel into one kingdom (2Sa 3:17-21; 5:1-3). It appears likewise that Toi, king of Hamath, formed an alliance with David (2Sa 9:10) and that Hiram of Tyre was his ally (1Ki 5:12  a). Alliances wrath foreign nations became essential to the progress of trade and commerce during the reign of Solomo...</p>

Thus the Revised Version (British and American) has removed the verb &quot;allow&quot; in each case in which it occurs in the King James Version, it being somewhat ambiguous in meaning (its original sense, as derived from Latin allocare, &quot;to place,&quot; &quot;assign,&quot; &quot;grant,&quot; being influenced by another word, Latin allaudare, &quot;to praise&quot;). The noun &quot;allowance&quot; occurs in the sense of quantity of food allowed, in 2Ki 25:30 (King James Version, the Revised Version (British and American)) and the parallel passage Jer 52:34 (RV; &quot;diet&quot; in the King James Version).D.

Then said Yahweh unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will watch (shoqedh) over my word to perform it.&quot; (2) luz; the King James Version hazel, Ge 30:37; lauz is the modern Arabic name for &quot;almond&quot;--Luz was the old name of BETHEL (which see).1. Almond Tree:The almond tree is mentioned in Ec 12:5, where in the description of old age it says &quot;the almond-tree shall blossom.&quot; The reference is probably to the white hair of age. An almond tree in full bloom upon a distant hillside has a certain likeness to a head of white hair.2. A Rod of Almond:A rod of almond is referred to Ge 30:37, where &quot;Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond (luz) and of the plane-tree; and peeled white streaks in them&quot; as a means of securing &quot;ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted&quot; lambs and goats--a proceeding founded doubtless upon some ancient folklore. Aaron&#x27;s rod that budded (Nu 17:2,3) was an almond rod. Also see Jer 1:11 referred to above.3. The Blossoms:The blossoms of the almond are mentioned Ex 25:33 f; 37:19 f, etc. &quot;Cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop (i.e. knob) and a flower,&quot; is the description given of parts of the sacred candlesticks. It is doubtful exactly what was intended--the most probable is, as Dillmann has suggested, that the cup was modeled after the calyx of the almond flower. See CANDLESTICK.4. The Fruit:Israel directed his sons (Ge 43:11) to carry almonds as part of their present to Joseph in Egypt. Palestine is a land where the almond flourishes, whereas in Egypt it would appear to have been uncommon. Almonds are today esteemed a delicacy; they are eaten salted or beaten into a pulp with sugar like the familiar German Marzipan.The almond is Amygdalus communis (N.O. Rosaceae), a tree very similar to the peach. The common variety grows to the height of 25 feet and produces an abundant blossom which appears before the leaves; In Palestine this is fully out at the end of January or beginning of February; it is the harbinger of spring. This early blossoming is supposed to be the origin of the name shaqedh which contains the idea of &quot;early.&quot; The masses of almond trees in full bloom in some parts of Palestine make a very beautiful and striking sight. The bloom of some varieties is almost pure white, from a little distance, in other parts the delicate pink, always present at the inner part of the petals, is diffused enough to give a pink blush to the whole blossom. The fruit is a drupe with a dry fibrous or woody husk which splits into two halves as the fruit ripens. The common wild variety grows a kernel which is bitter from the presence of a substance called amygdalon, which yields in its turn prussic (hydrocyanic) acid. Young trees are grafted with cuttings from the sweet variety or are budded with apricot, peach or ...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ol&#x27;-most (en oligo): In Ac 26:28 the Greek en oligo does not mean &quot;almost,&quot; although scholars have for centuries translated the clause &quot;Almost thou persuadest me to become a Christian.&quot; The revisers saw clearly the errors of their predecessors, so far as the signification of the first two words is concerned; but their explanation of the sentence is also erroneous; for the Greek cannot mean &quot;With but little persuasion thou wouldst fain make me a Christian.&quot; Paul&#x27;s reply proves that en oligo must be taken with the last word poiesai, not with peitheis, since he takes up Agrippa&#x27;s en oligo, couples it with en megalo and continues with genesthai which is the regular passive of poiesai (compare Lysias xii.71 with 72). And the idea of &quot;Christian&quot; is also taken up and repeated in hopoios kai ego eimi.An investigation of the usage of en oligo shows that it was never used in the sense of &quot;almost.&quot; soil from the peoples, mostly of their own blood, who have given up.The phrase occurs first in the Hymn to Hermes, 240, and here it is evidently an abbreviated expression for the Homeric oligo eni choro (M 423). Compare K 161, P 394. But it was used for both time and place, with the substantive expressed or understood (Thuc. i.93.1; iii.66.3; iv.26.3; iv.55.3; ii.84.3; ii.86.5; iv.96.3; v.112; vii.67.3; vii.87.1; Pind. Pyth. viii.131; Eur. Suppl. 1126; Hel. 771; Isoc. iv.83; Dem. lviii.60; iii.18). These uses persist from Homer far down into the post-classical literature (Plut. Per. 159 F; Coriol. 217 F; Mar. 427 A; Crass. 547 C; Polyb. x.18; Appian, Mithrad. 330; Themistius xi.143 C; Eustath. II.B, p.339.18). In the New Testament the phrase occurs also in Eph 3:3. Here too the common versions are incorrect. The clause in which the phrase occurs means simply, &quot;as I said a little while ago&quot;--the addition of en oligo merely indicates that the interval indicated by pro is short, an idea which would have been expressed in classical Greek by the simple dative, oligo and the adverb proteron (Ar. Thesm. 578; Aeschin. i. 2, 26, 72, 165; ii. 77, 147). Only a short while before Paul had expressed practically the same thought (Eph 3:3) and in almost identical language.Consequently, en oligo, in the New Testament, means &quot;a little,&quot; and is equivalent to oligos which occurs in 2Pe 2:18. In classical writers the idea would have been expressed by oligon, or kat&#x27; oligon. So en oligo, which originally signified &quot;in a little space&quot; (or time), comes to mean simply &quot;a little (bit),&quot; ein bischen, but is never equivalent to oligou (&quot;within a little&quot;) in any period of the language. The King James translators disregarded the real significance of poiesai, or adopted the reading of the inferior manuscripts (genesthai), so as to make the rest of the sentence harmonize with their translation of the first two words; and the revisers force the last two words into an impossible service, since the object of poiesai of which Christianon is the lucrative predicate, must be a third person, but cert...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ams, ams-giv&#x27;-ing:The English word &quot;alms&quot; is an abridged form of the Greek word, eleemosune (compare &quot;eleemosynary&quot;), appearing in gradually reduced forms in German Almosen, Wyclif&#x27;s Almesse, Scotch Aw&#x27;mons, and our alms.The later Jews often used &quot;righteousness&quot; tsedhaqah as meaning alms, that being in their view the foremost righteousness. (Compare our modern use of &quot;charity&quot; to denote almsgiving.) This use is seen in the Talmud and in the frequent translations of the Hebrew word for &quot;righteousness&quot; (tsedhaqah) by &quot;alms&quot; (eleemosune) in the Septuagint, though nothing warranting this is found in the Hebrew Old Testament, or in the true text of the New Testament. This notion of righteousness as alms being well-nigh universal among Jews in Jesus&#x27; day, and spreading even among Christians, accounts for &quot;alms&quot; in Mt 6:1, where the true text has &quot;righteousness&quot;: &quot;Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them&quot; (the Revised Version (British and American) with Codex Vaticanus, Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Bezae, the Latin versions, etc.). The oriental versions which generally read &quot;alms&quot; may be accounted for on the supposition that &quot;alms&quot; was first written on the margin as explaining the supposed meaning of &quot;righteousness,&quot; and then, as according with this accepted oriental idea, was substituted for it in the text by the copyists.Dikaiosune and eleemosune are both used in the Septuagint to translate chesedh, &quot;kindness,&quot; and are also both used to translate tsedhaqah, &quot;justice.&quot; Almsgiving was regarded not merely as a plain evidence of righteousness in general but also as an act of justice, a just debt owing to the needy. &quot;No one refuses directly,&quot; Mackie says, hence, possibly, Christ&#x27;s teaching in Lu 11:41, &quot;Let your righteousness (charity) be from within,&quot; &quot;Give your hearts to almsgiving.&quot;In the course of time the impulse and command to give alms in a true human way, out of pity, such as is found expressed in De 15:11 the King James Version, &quot;Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land,&quot; gave place to a formal, meritorious&quot; practice, possessing, like sacrifice, as men came to think, the power of atoning for man&#x27;s sins, and redeeming him from calamity and death. For instance, Pr 11:4 (compare Pr 16:6, 21:3) was expounded: &quot;Water will quench blazing fire; so doth almsgiving make atonement for sins&quot; (Ecclesiasticus 3:30). &quot;Lay up alms in thy storehouse; it shall deliver thee from affliction&quot; (Ecclesiasticus 29:12). The story of Tobit is especially in point: it is simply a lesson on almsgiving and its redeeming powers: &quot;Alms delivers from death and will purge away all sin&quot; (Tobit 1:3,16; 2:14; 4:7-11; 12:8,9. Compare Sirach 29:11 ff). Kindred teaching abounds in the Talmud: &quot;Alms-giving is more excellent than all offerings,&quot; is &quot;equal to the whole law,&quot; will &quot;deliver from the condemnation of hell,&quot; will &quot;make one perfectly righteous,&quot; etc. According to Rabbi Assi, &quot;Almsgiving is a powerf...</p>

Solomon sent to Hiram, king of Tyre, saying, &quot;Send me also cedar-trees, fir-trees, and algum-trees, out of Lebanon&quot; (2Ch 2:8). In 1Ki 10:11 it is said that the navy of Hiram &quot;that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug-trees and precious stones.&quot; In the parallel passage in 2Ch 9:10 it is said that &quot;algum-trees and precious stones&quot; were brought. From this wood &quot;the king made .... pillars for the house of Yahweh, and for the king&#x27;s house, harps also and psalteries for the singers: there came no such almug-trees, nor were seen, unto this day&quot; (1Ki 10:12). The wood was evidently very precious and apparently came from East Asia--unless we suppose from 2Ch 2:8 that it actually grew on Lebanon, which is highly improbable; it was evidently a fine, close grained wood, suitable for carving. Tradition says that this was the famous sandal wood, which was in ancient times put to similar uses in India and was all through the ages highly prized for its color, fragrance, durability and texture. It is the wood of a tree, Pterocar pussantalinus (N.D. Santalaceae), which grows to a height of 25 to 30 feet; it is a native of the mountains of Malabar.E. W. G. Masterman</p>

In So 4:14, it occurs in a list of the most precious spices. The most memorable use of aloes as a spice is in Joh 19:39: &quot;There came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him at night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.&quot; This was an immense quantity and if the aloes bore any large proportion to the myrrh the mixture must have been purchased at a very high cost. The most difficult mention of aloes is the earliest where (Nu 24:5,6) Balaam in his blessing on Israel exclaims--  &quot;How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, Thy tabernacles, O Israel! As valleys are they spread forth, As gardens by the river-side, As lign-aloes which Yahweh hath planted, As cedar-trees beside the waters.&quot;  As the aloes in question grow in East Asia it is difficult to see how Balaam could have come to speak of them as living trees. Post (HDB, I, 69) suggests that they may possibly have been growing at that time in the Jordan valley; this is both improbable and unnecessary. Balaam need have had no actual tree in his mind&#x27;s eye but may have mentioned the aloe as a tree famous over the Orient for its preciousness. That the reference is poetical rather than literal may be supposed by the expression in the next verse &quot;cedar-trees beside the waters&quot;--a situation very unnatural for the high-mountain-loving cedar. Yet another explanation is that the Hebrew has been altered and that &#x27;elim, &quot;terebinths&quot; instead of &#x27;ahalim, &quot;aloes&quot; stood in the original text. The aloe wood of the Bible is eaglewood--so misnamed by the Portuguese who confused the Malay name for it (agora) with the Latin aquila, &quot;eagle&quot;--a product of certain trees of the Natural Order Aquilariaceae, growing in Southeast Asia The two most valued varieties are Aquilaria malaccensis and Aloes agallocha--both fine spreading trees. The resin, which gives the fragrant quality to the wood, is formed almost entirely in the heart wood; logs are buried, the outer part decays while the inner, saturated with the resin, forms the &quot;eagle wood&quot; or &quot;aloe wood&quot; of commerce; &quot;aloes&quot; being the same wood in a finely powdered condition. To the Arabs this wood is known as `ud. It shows a beautiful graining and takes a high polish.These aloes must be clearly distinguished from the well-known medicinal aloes, of ancient fame. This is a resin from Aloes socatrina, and allied species, of the Natural Order Liliaceae, originally from the island of Socotra, but now from Barbados, the Cape of Good Hope and other places. The &quot;American aloe&quot; (Agave americana) which today is cultivated in many parts of Palestine, is also quite distinct from the Biblical plant.E. W. G. Masterman</p>

Compare Theodoret, Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica, iv. 8: &quot;We used alpha down to omega, i.e. all.&quot; A similar expression is found in Latin (Martial, v.26). Compare Aretas (Cramer&#x27;s Catenae Graecae in New Testament) on Re 1:8 and Tertullian (Monog, 5): &quot;So also two Greek letters, the first and last, did the Lord put on Himself, symbols of the beginning and the end meeting in Him, in order that just as alpha rolls on to omega and omega returns again to alpha, so He might show that both the evolution of the beginning to the end is in Him and again the return of the end to the beginning.&quot; Cyprian, Testim, ii.1; vi.22, iii.100, Paulinus of Nola Carm. xix.645; xxx.89; Prudentius, Cathem., ix.10-12. In Patristic and later literature the phrase is regularly applied to the Son. God blesses Israel from &#x27;aleph to taw (Le 26:3-13), but curses from waw to mem (Le 26:14-43). So Abraham observed the whole law from &#x27;aleph to taw. Consequently, &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot; may be a Greek rendering of the Hebrew phrase, which expressed among the later Jews the whole extent of a thing.J. E. Harry</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">al&#x27;-fa-bet.1. Definition:An alphabet is a list of the elementary sounds used in any language. More strictly speaking it is that particular series, commonly known as the Phoenician or Canaanite alphabet, which was in use in the region of Palestine about 1000 BC, and which is the ancestor of nearly all modern written alphabets whether Semitic or European. It is the alphabet therefore of Old Testament Hebrew and Aramaic and New Testament Greek, of the superscription of Caesar and the Latin inscription on the cross, as well as of English through the Greek and Latin. It is an interesting fact, with many practical bearings on text and exegesis, that three sets of letters so very unlike in appearance as Hebrew, Greek and modern English should be the same in origin and alike in nature. Although the earliest surviving inscriptions must be a good deal later than the separation between the Greek and Hebrew, the records in each are more like one another than either is like its own modern printed form.The characteristics of an alphabet are(1) the analysis of sounds into single letters rather than syllables or images,(2) the fixed order of succession in the letters,(3) the signs for the sounds, whether names or written symbols. Of these the analysis into single letters, instead of whole words or syllables, is the characteristic element. The order of the letters may vary, as that of the Sanskrit does from the European, and yet the list remain not only alphabetic but the &quot;same&quot; alphabet, i.e. each sound represented by a similar name or written character. On the face of it, therefore, it might be imagined that the Egyptian and Babylonian, the Cypriote, the Minoan and other forms earlier than the Canaanite which are known or suspected to have had phonetic systems, may have had lists of these forms arranged in a fixed order, but these lists were not alphabetic until the final analysis into individual letters.2. Name:The name alphabet comes from the fist two letters of the Greek, alpha beta, just as the old English name for the alphabet, abc or abece, is simply the first three letters of the English alphabet, and thus is merely an abbreviation for the whole alphabet. It appears that the Greeks also used the first and last letters of the alphabet (alpha and omega) as the Jews did the first and last, or the first, middle and last letters of their alphabet, as abbreviation for the whole and in the same sense that in English one says &quot;a to izzard.&quot; Alpha and beta are themselves derived from the Semitic names for the same letters (&#x27;aleph, beth) and have no meaning in the Greek.3. Invention:The question of the invention of this alphabet differs from the question of the origin of the written forms of the letters with which it is often confused, and relates to the recognition of the individual letters. Alphabetical language whether written or spoken, inward or outward, is distinguished from the pictographic, hieroglyphic, and syllabic stages by this analysis into individual...</p>

Levi is designated as Matthew in the Gospel of Mt 9:9. There is no other reference to this Alpheus.Some writers, notably Weiss, identify the father of Levi with the father of the second James. He says that James and Levi were undoubtedly brothers; but that seems improbable. If they were brothers they would quite likely be associated as are James and John, Andrew and Peter. Chrysostom says James and Levi had both been tax- gatherers before they became followers of Jesus. This tradition would not lend much weight as proof that they were brothers, for it might arise through identifying the two names, and the western manuscripts do identify them and read James instead of Levi in Mr 2:14. This, however, is undoubtedly a corruption of the text. If it had been the original it would be difficult to explain the substitution of an unknown Levi for James who is well known. Many writers identify Alpheus, the father of the second James, with Clopas of Joh 19:25. This had early become a tradition, and Chrysostom believed they were the same person. This identity rests on four suppositions, all of which are doubtful:(a) That the Mary of Clopas was the same as the Mary who was the mother of the second James. There is a difference of opinion as to whether &quot;Mary of Clopas&quot; should be understood to be the wife of Clopas or the daughter of Clopas, but the former is more probable. We know from Mt 27:56 and Mr 15:40 that there was a James who was the son of Mary, and that this Mary belonged to that little group of women that was near Jesus it the time of the crucifixion. It is quite likely that this Mary is the one referred to in Joh 19:25. That would make James, the son of Mary of Mt 27:56, the son of Mary of Clopas. But Mary was such a common name In the New Testament that this supposition cannot be proven.(b) That the James, who was the son of Mary, was the same person as the James, the son of Alpheus. Granting the supposition under (a), this would not prove the identity of Clopas and Alpheus unless this supposition can also be proven, but it seems impossible to either prove it or disprove it.(c) That Alpheus and Clopas are different variations of a common original, and that the variation has arisen from different pronunciations of the first letter (&quot;ch&quot;) of the Aramaic original. There are good scholars who both support and deny this theory.(d) That Clopas had two names as was common at that time; but there is nothing to either substantiate or disprove this theory. See CLOPAS.It seems impossible to determine absolutely whether or not Alpheus, the father of the second James, and Clopas of Joh 19:25 are the same person, but it is quite probable that they are.A.

Classification of Hebrew Altars.Before considering the Biblical texts attention must be drawn to the fact that these texts know of at least two kinds of altars which were so different in appearance that no contemporary could possibly confuse them. The first was an altar consisting of earth or unhewn stones. It had no fixed shape, but varied with the materials. It might consist of a rock (Jud 13:19) or a single large stone (1Sa 14:33-35) or again a number of stones (1Ki 18:31 f). It could have no horns, nor it would be impossible to give the stone horns without hewing it, nor would a heap of earth lend itself to the formation of horns. It could have no regular pattern for the same reason. On the other hand we meet with a group of passages that refer to altars of quite a different type. We read of horns, of fixed measurements, of a particular pattern, of bronze as the material. To bring home the difference more rapidly illustrations of the two types are given side by side. The first figure represents a cairn altar such as was in use in some other ancient religions. The second is a conjectural restoration of Hebrew altars of burnt offering and incense of the second kind.Importance of the Distinction:Both these might be and were called altars, but it is so evident that this common designation could not have caused any eye-witness to confuse the two that in reading the Bible we must carefully examine each text in turn and see to which kind the author is referring. Endless confusion has been caused, even in our own time, by the failure to note this distinction, and the reader can hope to make sense of the Biblical laws and narratives only if he be very careful to picture to himself in every case the exact object to which his text refers. For the sake of clearness different terms will be adopted in this article to denote the two kinds of altars. The first will be termed &quot;lay altars&quot; since, as will be seen, the Law permitted any layman to offer certain sacrifices at an altar of earth or unhewn stone without the assistance of a priest, while the second while be styled &quot;horned altars,&quot; owing to their possession of horns which, as already pointed out, could not exist in a lay altar that conformed with the provisions of the law.II.

They were nomads as a people dwelling in that tract would naturally be. When they joined the Midianites to invade Israel they came &quot;with their cattle and their tents&quot; (Jud 6:3-5). They are not to be identified with the descendants of Esau (Ge 36:12,16) because they are mentioned earlier, in the account of the invasion of Chedorlaomer (Ge 14:7) and in Balaam&#x27;s prophecy (Nu 24:20) Amalek is called &quot;the first of the nations,&quot; which seems to refer to an early existence. We are uncertain of their origin, for they do not appear in the list of nations found in Ge 10. They do not seem to have had any relationship with the tribes of Israel, save as, we may surmise, some of the descendants of Esau were incorporated into the tribe. It is probable that they were of Semitic stock though we have no proof of it.The first contact with Israel was at Rephidim, in the wilderness of Sinai, where they made an unprovoked attack and were defeated after a desperate conflict (Ex 17:8-13; De 25:17,18). On account of this they were placed under the ban and Israel was commanded to exterminate them (De 25:19; 1Sa 15:2,3). The next encounter of the two peoples was when the Israelites attempted to enter Canaan from the west of the Dead Sea. The spies had reported that the Amalekites were to be found in the south, in connection with the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites (Nu 13:29). The Israelites at first refused to advance, but later determined to do so contrary to the will of God and the command of Moses. They were met by Amalek and the Canaanites and completely defeated (Nu 14:39-45). Amalek is next found among the allies of Moab in their attack upon Israel in the days of Eglon (Jud 3:13). They were also associated with the Midianites in their raids upon Israel (Jud 6:3), and they seemed to have gained a foothold in Ephraim, or at least a branch of them, in the hill country (Jud 5:14; 12:15), but it is evident that the great body of them still remained in their old habitat, for when Saul made war upon them he drove them toward Shur in the wilderness toward Egypt (1Sa 15:1-9). David also found them in the same region (1Sa 27:8; 30:1). After this they seem to have declined, and we find, in the days of Hezekiah, only a remnant of them who were smitten by the Simeonites at Mount Seir (1Ch 4:41-43). They are once mentioned in Psalms in connection with other inveterate enemies of Israel (Ps 83:7). The hatred Inspired by the Amalekites is reflected in the passages already mentioned which required their utter destruction. Their attack upon them when they were just escaped from Egypt and while they were struggling through the wilderness made a deep impression upon the Israelites which they never forgot, and the wrath of David upon the messenger who brought him news of the death of Saul and Jonat...</p>

He was a nephew of David and a cousin of Absalom, who made him commander of the army of rebellion. When the uprising had been quelled, David, in order to conciliate Amasa, promised him the position held by Joab; the latter had fallen from favor (2Sa 19:13 ff). When a new revolt broke out under Sheba, the son of Bichri (2Sa 20), Amasa was entrusted with the task of assembling the men of Judah. But Joab was eager for revenge upon the man who had obtained the office of command that he coveted. When Amasa met Joab at Gibeon, the latter murdered him while pretending to salute (2Sa 20:8-10; 1Ki 2:5).(2) Son of Hadlai, of the Bene &#x27;Ephrayim (&quot;Children of Ephraim&quot;), who, obeying the words of the prophet Oded, refused to consider as captives the Judeans who had been taken from Ahaz, king of Judah, by the victorious Israelites under the leadership of Pekah (2Ch 28:12).H.

It is the word especially used to show the effect of Christ&#x27;s miracles, teaching, character and Divine personality on those who saw and heard Him, and were made conscious of His supernatural power (Mt 12:23: &quot;All the multitudes were amazed&quot;). The miracles of Pentecost and the Holy Spirit&#x27;s bestowal of the gift of tongues produced the same universal wonder (Ac 2:7: &quot;They were all amazed and marveled&quot;).Dwight M. Pratt</p>

Son of Jehoash, and tenth king of Judah. Amaziah had a peaceable accession at the age of 25. A depleted treasury, a despoiled palace and temple, and a discouraged people were among the consequences of his father&#x27;s war with Hazael, king of Syria. When settled on the throne, Amaziah brought to justice the men who had assassinated his father. Amaziah verbal citation of De 24:16 in 2Ki 14:6, forbidding the punishment of children for a father&#x27;s offense, shows that the laws of this book were then known, and were recognized as authoritative, and, in theory, as governing the nation. His accession may be dated circa 812 (some put later).1. The Edomite War:The young king&#x27;s plan for the rehabilitation of his people was the restoration of the kingdom&#x27;s military prestige, so severely lowered in his father&#x27;s reign. A militia army, composed of all the young men above 20 years of age, was first organized and placed upon a war footing (2Ch 25:5; the number given, 300,000, is not a reliable one). Even this not being considered a large enough force to effect the project, 100 talents of silver were sent to engage mercenary troops for the expedition from Israel. When these came, a man of God strongly dissuaded the king from relying on them (2Ch 25:7 ff). When this was communicated to the soldiers, and they were sent back unemployed, it roused them to &quot;fierce anger&quot; (2Ch 25:10).2. Its Occasion:Amaziah&#x27;s purpose in making these extensive preparations for war, in a time of profound peace, is clear to the Southeast of Judah lay the Edomite state, with its capital at Petra. For many years Edom had been subject to Jehoshaphat, and a Hebrew &quot;deputy&quot; had governed it (1Ki 22:47). In the reign of his son and successor, Jehoram, a confederacy of Philistines, Arabians and Edomites took Libnah and made a raid on Jerusalem. A band of these penetrated the palace, which they plundered, abducted some women, and murdered all the young princes but the youngest (2Ch 21:17; 22:1). The public commotion and distress caused by such an event may be seen reflected in the short oracle of the prophet Obadiah, uttered against Edom, if, with some, Obadiah&#x27;s date is put thus early3. The Victory in the Valley of Salt:From that time &quot;Edom .... made a king over themselves&quot; (2Ch 21:8), and for fifty years following were practically independent. It was this blot on Jerusalem and the good name of Judah that Amaziah determined to wipe out. The army of retaliation went forward, and after a battle in the Valley of Salt, south of the Dead Sea, in which they were the victors, moved on to Petra. This city lies in a hollow, shut in by mountains, and approached only by a narrow ravine, through which a stream of water flows. Amaziah took it &quot;by storm&quot; (such is Ewald&#x27;s rendering of &quot;by war,&quot; in 2Ki 14:7). Great execution was done, many of the captives being thrown from the rock, the face of which is now covered with rock-cut tombs of the...</p>

The same Hebrew term is used of the messengers sent by Jacob to Esau (Ge 32:3); by Moses to the king of Edom (Nu 20:14). For abundant illustration consult &quot;Messenger&quot; (mal&#x27;akh) in any concordance. See CONCORDANCE. The inhabitants of Gibeon made themselves pretended ambassadors to Joshua in order to secure by deceit the protection of a treaty (&quot;covenant&quot;) (Jos 9:4).In the New Testament the term is used in a figurative sense. As the imprisoned representative of Christ at Rome Paul calls himself &quot;an ambassador in chains&quot; (Eph 6:20); and in 2Co 5:20 includes, with himself, all ministers of the gospel, as &quot;ambassadors .... on behalf of Christ,&quot; commissioned by Him as their sovereign Lord, with the ministry of reconciling the world to God. The Bible contains no finer characterization of the exalted and spiritual nature of the minister&#x27;s vocation as the representative of Jesus Christ, the King of kings, and Saviour of the world.Dwight M.

Amen is employed when an individual or the whole nation confirms a covenant or oath recited in their presence (Nu 5:22; De 27:15 ff; Ne 5:13, etc.). It also occurs at the close of a psalm or book of psalms, or of a prayer.That &quot;Amen&quot; was appended to the doxology in the early church is evident both from Paul and Rev, and here again it took the form of a response by the hearers. The ritual of the installation of the Lamb (Re 5:6-14) concludes with the Amen of the four beasts, and the four and twenty elders. It is also spoken after &quot;Yea: I come quickly&quot; (Re 22:20). And that Revelation reflects the practice of the church on earth, and not merely of an ideal, ascended community in heaven, may be concluded from 1Co 14:16, whence we gather that the lay brethren were expected to say &quot;Amen&quot; to the address.

History:On July 7, 1870, it was moved in the Lower House of the Convocation of Canterbury that in the work of revision the cooperation of American divines be invited. This resolution was assented to, and on December 7, 1871, the arrangements were completed. Under the general presidency of Dr. Philip Schaff, an Old Testament Company of fifteen scholars was formed, with Dr. W. H. Green as chairman, and a New Testament Company of sixteen members (including Dr. Schaff), with Dr. T. D. Woolsey as chairman. Work was begun on October 4, 1872, and took the form of offering criticisms on the successive portions of the English revision as they were received. These criticisms of the American Companies were duly considered by the English Companies during the second revision and the decisions were again sent to America for criticism. The replies received were once more given consideration and, finally, the unadopted readings for which the American Companies professed deliberate preference were printed as appendices to the two Testaments as published in 1881 and 1885. These lists, however, were not regarded by the American Companies as satisfactory. In the first place, it became evident that the English Companies, on account of their instructions and for other reasons, were not willing to make changes of a certain class. Consequently the American Companies insisted on only such readings as seemed to have a real chance of being accepted. And, in the second place, the English presses hurried the last part of the work and were unwilling to allow enough time for adequate thoroughness in the preparation of the lists. But it was hoped that the first published edition of the English Revised Version would not be considered definitive and that in the future such American proposals as had stood the test of public discussion might be incorporated into the text. This hope was disappointed--the English Companies disbanded as soon as their revision was finished and their work stood as final. As a result the American Companies resolved to continue their organization. They were pledged not to issue or endorse any new revision within fourteen years after the publication of the English Revised Version, and so it was not until 1900 that the American Standard Revised Version New Testament was published. The whole Bible was issued in the following year.2. Differences from English Revised Version:As the complete editions of the American Standard Revised Version give a full list of the changes made, only the more prominent need be mentioned here. A few of the readings printed in the appendices to the English Revised Version were abandoned, but many new ones were introduced, including some that had been adopted while the English work was in progress but which had not been pressed. (See above.) Still, in general appearance, the American Standard Revised Version differs but slightly from the English. The most important addition is found in the page-he...</p>

Herbert), &quot;They keep their churches so cleanly and amiable&quot; (Howell, 1644). &quot;What made the tabernacle of Moses lovely was not the outside, which was very mean, but what was within&quot; (John Gill).

He was the great- grandson of Perez, a son of Judah (Ge 38:29; 46:12) and the great-grandfather of Boaz, who again was the great- grandfather of David.

But in other genealogical passages (Ex 6:18; Nu 3:19; 1Ch 6:2) the sons of Kohath are Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel, and in two places (Ex 6:21; 1Ch 6:38) Izhar is mentioned as the father of Korah.(3) According to 1Ch 15:10,11 Amminadab was the name of a priest who took part in the removal of the ark to Jerusalem. He was the son of Uzziel, and therefore a nephew of Amminadab, son of Kohath (= Izhar).Thomas Lewis</p>

This is reflected in the name usually employed in Old Testament to designate them, Ben `Ammi, Bene `Ammon, &quot;son of my people,&quot; &quot;children of my people,&quot; i.e. relatives. Hence we find that the Israelites are commanded to avoid conflict with them on their march to the Promised Land (De 2:19). Their dwelling-place was on the east of the Dead Sea and the Jordan, between the Arnon and the Jabbok, but, before the advance of the Hebrews, they had been dispossessed of a portion of their land by the Amorites, who founded, along the east side of the Jordan and the Dead Sea, the kingdom of Sihon (Nu 21:21-31).We know from the records of Egypt, especially Tell el-Amarna Letters, the approximate date of the Amorite invasion (14th and 13th centuries, BC). They were pressed on the north by the Hittites who forced them upon the tribes of the south, and some of them settled east of the Jordan. Thus, Israel helped Ammonites by destroying their old enemies, and this makes their conduct at a later period the more reprehensible. In the days of Jephthah they oppressed the Israelites east of the Jordan, claiming that the latter had deprived them of their territory when they came from Egypt, whereas it was the possessions of the Amorites they took (Jud 11:1-28). They were defeated, but their hostility did not cease, and their conduct toward the Israelites was particularly shameful, as in the days of Saul (1Sa 11) and of David (2Sa 10). This may account for the cruel treatment meted out to them in the war that followed (2Sa 12:26-31).They seem to have been completely subdued by David and their capital was taken, and we find a better spirit manifested afterward, for Nahash of Rabbah showed kindness to him when a fugitive (2Sa 17:27-29). Their country came into the possession of Jeroboam, on the division of the kingdom, and when the Syrians of Damascus deprived the kingdom of Israel of their possessions east of the Jordan, the Ammonites became subjects of Benhadad, and we find a contingent of 1,000 of them serving as allies of that king in the great battle of the Syrians with the Assyrians at Qarqar (854 BC) in the reign of Shalmaneser II. They may have regained their old territory when Tiglath-pileser carried off the Israelites East of the Jordan into captivity (2Ki 15:29; 1Ch 5:26). Their hostility to both kingdoms, Judah and Israel, was often manifested. In the days of Jehoshaphat they joined with the Moabites in an attack upon him, but met with disaster (2Ch 20). They paid tribute to Jotham (2Ch 27:5). After submitting to Tiglath-pileser they were generally tributary to Assyria, but we have mention of their joining In the general uprising that took place under Sennacherib; but they submitted and we find them tributary in the reign of Esarhaddon.Their hostility to Judah is shown in their joining the Chaldeans to destroy it (2Ki 24...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a&#x27;-mon (&#x27;amon): A name identical with that of the Egyptian local deity of Thebes (No); compare Jer 46:25. The foreign name given to a Hebrew prince is remarkable, as is also the fact that it is one of the two or three royal names of Judah not compounded with the name of Yahweh. See MANASSEH. It seems to reflect the sentiment which his fanatical father sought to make prevail that Yahweh had no longer any more claim to identification with the realm than had other deities.(1) A king of Judah, son and successor of Manasseh; reigned two years and was assassinated in his own palace by the officials of his household. The story of his reign is told briefly in 2Ki 21:19-26, and still more briefly, though in identical terms, so far as they go, in 2Ch 33:21-25. His short reign was merely incidental in the history of Judah; just long enough to reveal the traits and tendencies which directly or indirectly led to his death. It was merely a weaker continuation of the regime of his idolatrous father, though without the fanaticism which gave the father positive character, and without the touch of piety which, if the Chronicler&#x27;s account is correct, tempered the father&#x27;s later years.If the assassination was the initial act of a revolution the latter was immediately suppressed by &quot;the people of the land,&quot; who put to death the conspirators and placed Amon&#x27;s eight-year-old son Josiah on the throne. In the view of the present writer the motive of the affair was probably connected with the perpetuity of the Davidic dynasty, which, having survived so long according to prophetic prediction (compare 2Sa 7:16; Ps 89:36,37), was an essential guarantee of Yahweh&#x27;s favor. Manasseh&#x27;s foreign sympathies, however, had loosened the hold of Yahweh on the officials of his court; so that, instead of being the loyal center of devotion to Israel&#x27;s religious and national idea, the royal household was but a hotbed of worldly ambitions, and all the more for Manasseh&#x27;s prosperous reign, so long immune from any stroke of Divine judgment.It is natural that, seeing the insignificance of Amon&#x27;s administration, some ambitious clique, imitating the policy that had frequently succeeded in the Northern Kingdom, should strike for the throne. They had reckoned, however, without estimating the inbred Davidic loyalty of the body of the people. It was a blow at one of their most cherished tenets, committing the nation both politically and religiously to utter uncertainty. That this impulsive act of the people was in the line of the purer religious movement which was ripening in Israel does not prove that the spiritually-minded &quot;remnant&quot; was minded to violence and conspiracy, it merely shows what a stern and sterling fiber of loyalty still existed, seasoned and confirmed by trial below the corrupting cults and fashions of the ruling classes. In the tragedy of Amon&#x27;s reign, in short, we get a glimpse of the basis of sound principle that lay at the common heart of Israel.(2) A governor of Samaria (1Ki 22...</p>

Varying Use of the Name Explained2. The Amorite Kingdom3. Sihon&#x27;s Conquest4. Disappearance of the Amorite Kingdom5. Physical Characteristics of the AmoritesThe name Amorite is used in the Old Testament to denote(1) the inhabitants of Palestine generally,(2) the population of the hills as opposed to the plain, and(3) a specific people under a king of their own. Thus(1) we hear of them on the west shore of the Dead Sea (Ge 14:7), at Hebron (Ge 14:13), and Shechem (Ge 48:22), in Gilead and Bashan (De 3:10) and under Hermon (De 3:8; 4:48). They are named instead of the Canaanites as the inhabitants of Palestine whom the Israelites were required to exterminate (Ge 15:16; De 20:17; Jud 6:10; 1Sa 7:14; 1Ki 21:26; 2Ki 21:11); the older population of Judah is called Amorite in Jos 10:5,6, in conformity with which Eze (16:3) states that Jerusalem had an Amorite father; and the Gibeonites are said to have been &quot;of the remnant of the Amorites&quot; (2Sa 21:2). On the other hand(2), in Nu 13:29 the Amorites are described as dwelling in the mountains like the Hittites and Jebusites of Jerusalem, while the Amalekites or Bedouins lived in the south and the Canaanites on the seacoast and in the valley of the Jordan. Lastly (3) we hear of Sihon, &quot;king of the Amorites,&quot; who had conquered the northern half of Moab (Nu 21:21-31; De 2:26-35).1. Varying Use of the Name Explained:Assyriological discovery has explained the varying use of the name. The Hebrew form of it is a transliteration of the Babylonian Amurru, which was both sing. and plural. In the age of Abraham the Amurru were the dominant people in western Asia; hence Syria and Palestine were called by the Babylonians &quot;the land of the Amorites.&quot; In the Assyrian period this was replaced by &quot;land of the Hittites,&quot; the Hittites in the Mosaic age having made themselves masters of Syria and Canaan. The use of the name &quot;Amorite&quot; in its general sense belongs to the Babylonian period of oriental history.2. The Amorite Kingdom:The Amorite kingdom was of great antiquity. About 2500 BC it embraced the larger part of Mesopotamia and Syria, with its capital probably at Harran, and a few centuries later northern Babylonia was occupied by an &quot;Amorite&quot; dynasty of kings who traced theft descent from Samu or Sumu (the Biblical Shem), and made Babylon their capital. To this dynasty belonged Khammu-rabi, the Amraphel of Ge 14:1. In the astrological documents of the period frequent reference is made to &quot;the king of the Amorites.&quot; This king of the Amorites was subject to Babylonia in the age of the dynasty of Ur, two or three centuries before the birth of Abraham He claimed suzerainty over a number of &quot;Amorite&quot; kinglets, among whom those of Khana on the Euphrates, near the mouth of the Khabur, may be named, since in the Abrahamic age one of them was called Khammu-rapikh and another Isarlim or Israel.

The Prophet.1. Name:Amos is the prophet whose book stands third among the &quot;Twelve&quot; in the Hebrew canon. No other person bearing the same name is mentioned in the Old Testament, the name of the father of the prophet Isaiah being written differently (&#x27;amots). There is an Amos mentioned in the genealogical series Lu 3:25, but he is otherwise unknown, and we do not know how his name would have been written in Hebrew. Of the signification of the prophet&#x27;s name all that can be said is that a verb with the same root letters, in the sense of to load or to carry a load, is not uncommon in the language.2. Native Place:Tekoa, the native place of Amos, was situated at a distance of 5 miles South from Bethlehem, from which it is visible, and 10 miles from Jerusalem, on a hill 2,700 ft. high, overlooking the wilderness of Judah. It was made a &quot;city for defense&quot; by Rehoboam (2Ch 11:6), and may have in fact received its name from its remote and exposed position, for the stem of which the word is a derivative is of frequent occurrence in the sense of sounding an alarm with the trumpet: e. g. &quot;Blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Beth-haccerem&quot; (Jer 6:1 the King James Version). The same word is also used to signify the setting up of a tent by striking in the tent- pegs; and Jerome states that there was no village beyond Tekoa in his time. The name has survived, and the neighborhood is at the present day the pasture-ground for large flocks of sheep and goats. From the high ground on which the modern village stands one looks down on the bare undulating hills of one of the bleakest districts of Palestine, &quot;the waste howling wilderness,&quot; which must have suggested some of the startling imagery of the prophet&#x27;s addresses. The place may have had--as is not seldom the case with towns or villages--a reputation for a special quality of its inhabitants; for it was from Tekoa that Joab fetched the &quot;wise woman&quot; who by a feigned story effected the reconciliation of David with his banished son Absalom (2Sa 14). There are traces in the Book of Am of a shrewdness and mother-wit which are not so conspicuous in other prophetical books.3. Personal History:The particulars of a personal kind which are noted in the book are few but suggestive. Amos was not a prophet or the son of a prophet, he tells us (Am 7:14), i.e. he did not belong to the professional class which frequented the so-called schools of the prophets. He was &quot;among the herd...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">am-fip&#x27;-o-lis (Amphipolis): A town in Macedonia, situated on the eastern bank of the Strymon (modern Struma or Karasu) some three miles from its mouth, near the point where it flows out of Lake Prasias or Cercinitis. It lay on a terraced hill, protected on the North, West and South by the river, on the East by a wall (Thuc. iv.102), while its harbor-town of Eion lay on the coast close to the river&#x27;s mouth. The name is derived either from its being nearly surrounded by the stream or from its being conspicuous on every side, a fact to which Thucydides draws attention (in the place cited). It was at first called Ennea Hodoi, Nine Ways, a name which suggests its importance both strategically and commercially. It guarded the main route from Thrace into Macedonia and later became an important station on the Via Egnatia, the great Roman road from Dyrrhachium on the Adriatic to the Hebrus (Maritza), and it was the center of a fertile district producing wine, oil, figs and timber in abundance and enriched by gold and silver mines and considerable manufactures, especially of woolen stuffs. In 497 BC Aristagoras, ex- despot of Miletus, tried to settle there, and a second vain attempt was made in 465-464 by the Athenians, who succeeded in founding a colony there in 437 under the leadership of Hagnon. The population, however, was too mixed to allow of strong Athenian sympathies, and in 424 the town fell away to the Spartan leader Brasidas and defied all the subsequent attempts of the Athenians to recover it. It passed under the protectorate of Perdiccas and Philip of Macedon, and the latter finally made himself master of it in 358. On the Roman partition of Macedonia after the battle of Pydna (168 BC) Amphipolis was made a free city and capital of Macedonia Prima. Paul and Silas passed through it on their way from Philippi to Thessalonica, but the narrative seems to preclude a long stay (Ac 17:1). The place was called Popolia in the Middle Ages, while in modern times the village of Neochori (Turkish, Yenikeui) marks the site (Leake, Northern Greece, III, 181 ff, Cousinery, Macedoine, I, 100 ff, 122 ff; Heuzey et Daumet, Mission archeol. de Macedoine, 165 ff).Marcus N.

It is not certain that he was literally the son of Kohath, but rather his descendant, since there were ten generations from Joseph to Joshua (1Ch 7:20-27), while only four are actually mentioned from Levi to Moses for the corresponding period. Moreover the Kohathites at the time of the Exodus numbered 8,600 (Nu 3:28), which would therefore have been an impossibility if only two generations had lived. It seems best to regard Amram as a descendant of Kohath, and his wife Jochebed as a &quot;daughter of Levi&quot; in a general sense.(2) One of the Bani, who in the days of Ezra had taken a foreign wife (Ezr 10:34).(3) In 1Ch 1:41 (the King James Version) for the properly read HAMRAN of the Revised Version (British and American) (chamran), a Horite, who in Ge 36:26 is called HEMDAN (which see).Edward Mack</p>

The Expedition Against Sodom and Gomorrah:This name, which is identified with that of the renowned Babylonian king Hammurabi (which see), is only found in Ge 14:1,9, where he is mentioned as the king of Shinar (Babylonia), who fought against the cities of the plain, in alliance with Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Nations (the Revised Version (British and American) GOIIM). The narrative which follows is very circumstantial. From it we learn, that Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela or Zoar, had served Chedorlaomer for 12 years, rebelled in the 13th, and in the 14th year Chedorlaomer, with the kings enumerated, fought with and defeated them in the vale of Siddim, which is described as being the Salt Sea. Previous to this engagement, however, the Elamites and their allies had attacked the Rephaim (Onkelos: &quot;giants&quot;) in Ashtaroth-karnaim, the Zuzim (O: &quot;mighty ones,&quot; &quot;heroes&quot;) in Ham (O: Chamta&#x27;), the Emim (O: &quot;terrible ones&quot;) in Shaveh-kiriathaim, and the Horites in their Mount Seir, by the Desert. These having been rendered powerless to aid the revolted vassals, they returned and came to Enmishpat, or Kadesh, attacked the country of the Amalekites, and the Amorites dwelling in Hazazontamar (Ge 14:2-7).2. The Preparation and the Attack:At this juncture the kings of the cities of the plain came out against them, and opposed them with their battle-array in the vale of Siddim. The result of the fight was, that the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, with their allies, fled, and fell among the bitumen-pits of which the place was full, whilst those who got away took refuge in the mountain. All the goods and food (the camp-equipment and supplies) of the kings of the plain were captured by Chedorlaomer and his allies, who then continued their march (to their own lands) (Ge 14:8-11).3. Abraham&#x27;s Rescue of Lot:Among the captives, however, was Lot, Abram&#x27;s nephew, who dwelt in Sodom. A fugitive, having escaped, went and announced the result of the engagement to Abram, who was at that time living by Mamre&#x27;s oak plantation. The patriarch immediately marched forth with his trained men, and pursued them to Dan, where he divided his forces, attacked the Elamite-Babylonian army by night, and having put them to flight, pursued them again to Hobah, on the left (or North) of Damascus. The result of this sudden onslaught was that he rescued Lot, with the women and people, and recaptured Lot&#x27;s goods, which the allies of Amraphel had carried off (Ge 14:12-16).4. Difficulties of the Identification of Amraphel:There is no doubt that the identification of Amraphel with the Hammurabi of the Babylonian inscriptions is the best that has yet been proposed, and though there are certain difficulties therein, these may turn out to be apparent rather than real, when we know more of Babylonian history.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">am&#x27;-u-let (qemia, lechashim, mezuzah, tephillin, tsitsith; phulakterion): Modern scholars are of opinion that our English word amulet comes from the Latin amuletum, used by Pliny (Naturalis Historia, xxviii, 28; xxx, 2, etc.), and other Latin writers; but no etymology for the Latin word has been discovered. The present writer thinks the root exists in the Arabic himlat, &quot;something carried&quot; (see Dozy, Supplement aux Dictionnaires Arabes, I, 327), though there is no known example of the use of the Arabic word in a magical sense. Originally &quot;amulet&quot; denoted any object supposed to have the power of removing or warding noxious influences believed to be due to evil spirits, etc., such as the evil eye, etc. But in the common usage it stands for an object worn on the body, generally hung from the neck, as a remedy or preservative against evil influences of a mystic kind. The word &quot;amulet&quot; occurs once in the Revised Version (British and American) (Isa 3:20) but not at all in the King James Version.1. Classes of Amulets:The substances out of which amulets have been made and the forms which they have taken have been various.(1) The commonest have consisted of Amulets of pieces of stone or metal, strips of parchment with or without inscriptions from sacred writings (Bible, Koran, etc.). The earliest Egyptian amulets known are pieces of green schist of various shapes- -animal, etc. These were placed on the breast of a deceased person in order to secure a safe passage to the under-world. When a piece of stone is selected as an amulet it is always portable and generally of some striking figure or shape (the human face, etc.). The use of such a stone for this purpose is really a survival of animism.(2) Gems, rings, etc. It has been largely held that all ornaments worn on the person were originally amulets.(3) Certain herbs and animal preparations; the roots of certain plants have been considered very potent as remedies and preservatives.The practice of wearing amulets existed in the ancient world among all peoples, but especially among Orientals; and it can be traced among most modern nations, especially among peoples of backward civilization. Nor is it wholly absent from peoples of the most advanced civilization of today, the English, Americans, etc. Though the word charm (see CHARM) has a distinct meaning, it is often inseparably connected with amulets, for it is in many cases the incantation or charm inscribed on the amulet that gives the latter its significance. As distinguished from talisman (see TALISMAN) an amulet is believed to have negative results, as a means of protection: a talisman is thought to be the means of securing for the wearer some positive boon.2. Amulets in the Bible:Though there is no word in the Hebrew or Greek Scriptures denoting &quot;amulet,&quot; the thing itself is manifestly implied in many parts of the Bible. But it is remarkable that the general teaching of the Bible and especially that of the Old Testament prophets and of the New Testamen...</p>

The Septuagint, the Samaritan Pentateuch, and the Peshitta read &quot;son,&quot; identifying this Anah with number 3 (see below); Ge 36:2, read (ha-chori), for (ha-chiwwi).(2) Son of Seir, the Horite, and brother of Zibeon; one of the chiefs of the land of Edom (compare Ge 36:20,21 = 1Ch 1:38). Seir is elsewhere the name of the land (compare Ge 14:6; Isa 21:11); but here the country is personified and becomes the mythical ancestor of the tribes inhabiting it.(3) Son of Zibeon, &quot;This is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness&quot; (compare Ge 36:24 = 1Ch 1:40,41)The word ha-yemim, occurs only in this passage and is probably corrupt. Ball (Sacred Books of the Old Testament, Genesis, critical note 93) suggests that it is a corruption of we-hemam (compare Ge 36:22) in an earlier verse. Jerome, in his commentary on Ge 36:24, assembles the following definitions of the word gathered from Jewish sources.(1) &quot;seas&quot; as though yammim;(2) &quot;hot springs&quot; as though hammim;(3) a species of ass, yemim;(4) &quot;mules.&quot;This last explanation was the one most frequently met with in Jewish lit; the tradition ran that Anah was the first to breed the mule, thus bringing into existence an unnatural species. As a punishment, God created the deadly water-snake, through the union of the common viper with the Libyan lizard (compare Ge Rabbah 82 15, Yer. Ber 1 12b; Babylonian Pes 54a, Ginzberg, Monatschrift, XLII, 538-39).The descent of Anah is thus represented in the three ways pointed out above as the text stands. If, however, we accept the reading ben, for bath, in the first case, Aholibamah will then be an unnamed daughter of the Anah of Ge 36:24, not the Aholibamah, daughter of Anah of 36:25 (for the Anah of this verse is evidently the one of 36:20, not the Anah of 36:24). Another view is that the words, &quot;the daughter of Zibeon,&quot; are a gloss, inserted by one who mistakenly identified the Anah of 36:25 with the Anah of 36:24; in this event, Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah, will be the one mentioned in 36:25. The difference between (2) and (3) is to be explained on the basis of a twofold tradition. Anah was originally a sub-clan of the clan known as Zibeon, and both were &quot;sons of Seir&quot;--i.e. Horites.H. J. Wolf</p>

In Nu 13:22 the chiefs of Hebron are said to be descendants of Anak, while &quot;the father of Anak&quot; is stated in Jos (15:13; 21:11) to be Arba after whom Hebron was called &quot;the city of Arba.&quot; Jos &quot;cut off the Anakim .... from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, .... and from all the hill-country of Israel,&quot; remnants of them being left in the Philistine cities of Gaza, Gath and Ashdod (Jos 11:21,22). As compared with the Israelites, they were tall like giants (Nu 13:33), and it would therefore seem that the &quot;giant&quot; Goliath and his family were of their race.At Hebron, at the time of the Israelite conquest, we may gather that they formed the body-guard of the Amorite king (see Jos 10:5) under their three leaders Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai (Nu 13:22; Jos 15:14; Jud 1:20). Tell el-Amarna Letters show that the Canaanite princes were accustomed to surround themselves with bodyguards of foreign mercenaries. It appears probable that the Anakim came from the Aegean like the Philistines, to whom they may have been related. The name Anak is a masculine corresponding with a feminine which we meet with in the name of the goddess Onka, who according to the Greek writers, Stephanus of Byzantium and Hesychius, was the &quot;Phoen,&quot; i.e. Syrian equivalent of Athena. Anket or Anukit was also the name of the goddess worshipped by the Egyptians at the First Cataract. In the name Ahi-man it is possible that &quot;-man&quot; denotes a non-Semitic deity.A. H.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-nam&#x27;-e-lek (`anammelekh = Assyrian Anu-malik, &quot;Anu is the prince&quot;): A Babylonian (?) deity worshipped by the Sepharvites in Samaria, after being transported there by Sargon. The worship of Adrammelech (who is mentioned with Anammelech) and Anammelech is accompanied by the sacrifice of children by fire: &quot;The Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim&quot; (2Ki 17:31). This passage presents two grave difficulties. First, there is no evidence in cuneiform literature that would point to the presence of human sacrifice, by fire or otherwise, as part of the ritual; nor has it been shown that the sculptures or bas-reliefs deny this thesis.Much depends upon the identification of &quot;Sepharvaim&quot;; if, as some scholars hold, Sepharvaim and Sippar are one and the same cities, the two deities referred to are Babylonian. But there are several strong objections to this theory. It has been suggested that Sepharvaim (Septuagint, seppharin, sepphareimi) is rather identical with &quot;Shabara&#x27;in,&quot; a city mentioned in the Babylonian Chronicle as having been destroyed by Shalmaneser IV. As Sepharvaim and Arpad and Hamath are grouped together (2Ki 17:24; 18:34) in two passages, it is probable that Sepharvaim is a Syriac city. Sepharvaim may then be another form of &quot;Shabara&#x27;in,&quot; which, in turn, is the Assyrian form of Sibraim (Eze 47:16), a city in the neighborhood of Damascus (of Halevy, ZA, II, 401 ff). One objection to this last is the necessity for representing &quot;c&quot; by &quot;sh&quot;; this is not necessarily insurmountable, however. Then, the attempt to find an Assyrian etymology for the two god-names falls to the ground. Besides, the custom of sacrifice by fire was prevalent in Syria. Secondly, the god that was worshipped at Sippar was neither Adrammelech nor Anammelech but Samas. It is improbable, as some would urge, that Adrammelech is a secondary title of the tutelary god of Sippar; then it would have to be shown that Anu enjoyed special reverence in this city which was especially consecrated to the worship of the Sun-god. (For &quot;Anu&quot; see ASSYRIA.) It may be that the text is corrupt. See also ADRAMMELECH.H. J. Wolf</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">an-a-ni&#x27;-as (Ananias; Westcott and Hort, The New Testament in Greek, Hananias; chananyah, &quot;Yah has been gracious&quot;): The name was common among the Jews. In its Hebrew form it is frequently found in the Old Testament (e.g. 1Ch 25:4; Jer 28:1; Da 1:6).See HANANIAH.1. A Disciple at Jerusalem:Husband of Sapphira (Ac 5:1-10). He and his wife sold their property, and gave to the common fund of the church part of the purchase money, pretending it was the whole. When his hypocrisy was denounced by Peter, Ananias fell down dead; and three hours later his wife met the same doom. The following points are of interest.(1) The narrative immediately follows the account of the intense brotherliness of the believers resulting in a common fund, to which Barnabas had made a generous contribution (Ac 4:32-37). The sincerity and spontaneity of the gifts of Barnabas and the others set forth in dark relief the calculated deceit of Ananias. The brighter the light, the darker the shadow.(2) The crime of Ananias consisted, not in his retaining a part, but in his pretending to give the whole. He was under no compulsion to give all, for the communism of the early church was not absolute, but purely voluntary (see especially Ac 5:4) Falsehood and hypocrisy (&quot;lie to the Holy Spirit&quot; Ac 5:3), rather than greed, were the sins for which he was so severely punished.(3) The severity of the Judgment can be justified by the consideration that the act was &quot;the first open venture of deliberate wickedness&quot; (Meyer) within the church. The punishment was an &quot;awe-inspiring act of Divine church-discipline.&quot; The narrative does not, however, imply that Peter consciously willed their death. His words were the occasion of it, but he was not the deliberate agent. Even the words in Ac 5:9 are a prediction rather than a judicial sentence.2. A Disciple at Damascus:A disciple in Damascus, to whom the conversion of Saul of Tarsus was made known in a vision, and who was the instrument of his physical and spiritual restoration, and the means of introducing him to the other Christians in Damascus (Ac 9:10-19). Paul makes honorable mention of him in his account of his conversion spoken at Jerusalem (Ac 22:12-16), where we are told that Ananias was held in high respect by all the Jews in Damascus, on account of his strict legal piety. No mention is made of him in Paul&#x27;s address before Agrippa in Caesarea (Ac 26). In late tradition, he is placed in the list of the seventy disciples of Jesus, and represented as bishop of Damascus, and as having died a martyr&#x27;s death.3. A High Priest at Jerusalem:A high priest in Jerusalem from 47-59 AD. From Josephus (Ant., XX, v, 2; vi, 2; ix, 2; BJ, II, xvii, 9) we glean the following facts: He was the son of Nedebaeus (or Nebedaeus) and was nominated to the high-priestly office by Herod of Chalcis. In 52 AD he was sent to Rome by Quadratus, legate of Syria, to answer a charge of oppression brought by the Samaritans, but the emperor Claudius acquitted him. On his return to...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-nath&#x27;-e-ma (anathema): This word occurs only once in the King James Version, namely, in the phrase &quot;Let him be anathema. Maranatha&quot; (1Co 16:22); elsewhere the King James Version renders anathema by &quot;accursed&quot; (Ro 9:3; 1Co 12:3; Ga 1:8,9), once by &quot;curse&quot; (Ac 23:12). Both words--anathema and anathema--were originally dialectical variations and had the same connotation, namely, offering to the gods. The non-Attic form--anathema--was adopted in the Septuagint as a rendering of the Hebrew cherem (see ACCURSED), and gradually came to have the significance of the Hebrew word--&quot;anything devoted to destruction.&quot; Whereas in the Greek Fathers anathema--as cherem in rabbinic Hebrew-- came to denote excommunication from society, in the New Testament the word has its full force. In common speech it evidently became a strong expression of execration, and the term connoted more than physical destruction; it invariably implied moral worthlessness. In Ro 9:3 Paul does not simply mean that, for the sake of his fellow-countrymen, he is prepared to face death, but to endure the moral degradation of an outcast from the kingdom of Christ. In 1Co 12:3 the expression, &quot;Jesus is anathema&quot;--with its suggestion of moral unfitness--reaches the lowest depths of depreciation, as the expression, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; reaches the summit of appreciation.Thomas Lewis</p>

It was the native place of Abiathar (1Ki 2:26), and of the prophet Jer (Jer 1:1; 11:21 ff, etc.). Here lay the field which, under remarkable circumstances, the prophet purchased (Jer 32:7 ff). Two of David&#x27;s distinguished soldiers, Abiezer (2Sa 23:27) and Jehu (1Ch 12:3), also hailed from Anathoth. It was again occupied by the Benjamites after the return from the Exile (Ne 11:32, etc.). It is identified with `Anata, two and a quarter miles Northeast of Jerusalem, a small village of some fifteen houses with remains of ancient walls. There are quarries in the neighborhood from which stones are still carried to Jerusalem. It commands a spacious outlook over the uplands to the North, and especially to the Southeast, over the Jordan valley toward the Dead Sea and the mountains of Moab. There is nothing to shelter it from the withering power of the winds from the eastern deserts (Jer 4:11; 18:17, etc.).W. Ewing</p>

Whereas the King James Version generally renders the word by &quot;old&quot; (or &quot;elders&quot; when the plural form is found) in six cases &quot;ancient&quot; is used and &quot;ancients&quot; in nine cases. See ANCIENTS.(3) `olam, which denotes &quot;long duration&quot; --past or future. In regard to the past it suggests remote antiquity. The connotation may be discovered in such expressions as: &quot;the years of ancient times&quot; (Ps 77:5); &quot;ancient land-mark&quot; or &quot;paths&quot; (Pr 22:28; Jer 18:15); &quot;ancient people&quot; or &quot;nation&quot; (Isa 44:7; Jer 5:15); &quot;ancient high places&quot; (Eze 36:2).(4) `attiq. This word--really Aramaic--comes from a stem which means &quot;to advance,&quot; i.e. in age; hence old, aged (1Ch 3:22).(5) yashish, literally, &quot;weak,&quot; &quot;impotent,&quot; hence decrepit aged; a rare and poetical word, and found only in Job.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">an-shents: This word (except in one instance) renders the Hebrew word zeqenim, (pl of zaqen), which should always be translated &quot;old men&quot; or &quot;elders.&quot; The Hebrew word never has the connotation which &quot;ancients&quot; has in modern English. The words &quot;I understand more than the ancients&quot; (Ps 119:100 the King James Version) do not mean that the Psalmist claims greater wisdom than his distant forbears but than his contemporaries with all their age and experience. In the parallel clause &quot;teachers&quot; is the corresponding word. In such phrases as &quot;ancients of the people&quot; (Jer 19:1 the King James Version), &quot;ancients of the house of Israel&quot; (Eze 8:12), &quot;elders&quot; would obviously be the correct rendering, as in the Revised Version (British and American). Even in Isa 24:23 (&quot;before his ancients gloriously&quot; the English Revised Version) &quot;elders&quot; is the right translation (American Revised Version). The writer probably alludes to the Sinaitic; theophany witnessed by the &quot;seventy .... elders&quot; (Ex 24:9-18) Generally speaking the word suggests the experience, insight and practical acquaintance with life which age ought to bring with it (Ps 119:100; Eze 7:26). In one instance (1Sa 24:13) &quot;ancients&quot; is the right rendering for the Hebrew word qadhmonim, which means &quot;men of former times.&quot;Thomas Lewis</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">an&#x27;-droo (Andreas, i.e. &quot;manly.&quot; The name has also been interpreted as &quot;the mighty one, or conqueror&quot;): Andrew was the first called of the Twelve Apostles.I. In New Testament.1. Early History and First Call:Andrew belonged to Bethsaida of Galilee (compare Joh 1:44). He was the brother of Simon Peter and his father&#x27;s name was John (compare Joh 1:42; 21:15,16,17). He occupies a more prominent place in the Gospel of Joh than in the synoptical writings, and this is explicable at least in part from the fact that Andrew was Greek both in language and sympathies (compare infra), and that his subsequent labors were intimately connected with the people for whom Joh was immediately writing. There are three stages in the call of Andrew to the apostleship. The first is described in Joh 1:35-40. Andrew had spent his earlier years as a fisherman on the Sea of Galilee, but on learning of the fame of John the Baptist, he departed along with a band of his countrymen to Bethabara (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;Bethany&quot;) beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing (Joh 1:28). Possibly Jesus was of their number, or had preceded them in their pilgrimage. There Andrew learned for the first time of the greatness of the &quot;Lamb of God&quot; and &quot;followed him&quot; (Joh 1:40). He was the means at this time of bringing his brother Simon Peter also to Christ (Joh 1:41). Andrew was probably a companion of Jesus on his return journey to Galilee, and was thus present at the marriage in Cana of Galilee (Joh 2:2), in Capernaum (Joh 2:12), at the Passover in Jerusalem (Joh 2:13), at the baptizing in Judea (Joh 3:22), where he himself may have taken part (compare Joh 4:2), and in Samaria (Joh 4:5).2. Second Call and Final Ordination:On his return to Galilee, Andrew resumed for a time his old vocation as fisherman, till he received his second call. This happened after John the Baptist was cast into prison (compare Mr 1:14; Mt 4:12) and is described in Mr 1:16-18; Mt 4:18,19. The two accounts are practically identical, and tell how Andrew and his brother were now called on definitely to forsake their mundane occupations and become fishers of men (Mr 1:17). The corresponding narrative of Luke varies in part; it does not mention Andrew by name, and gives the additional detail of the miraculous draught of fishes. By some it has been regarded as an amalgamation of Mark&#x27;s account with Joh 21:1-8 (see JAMES). After a period of companionship with Jesus, during which, in the house of Simon and Andrew, Simon&#x27;s wife&#x27;s mother was healed of a fever (Mr 1:29-31; compare Mt 8:14,15; Lu 4:38,39); the call of Andrew was finally consecrated by his election as one of the Twelve Apostles (Mt 10:2; Mr 3:18; Lu 6:14; Ac 1:13).3. Subsequent History:Further incidents recorded of Andrew are: At the feeding of the five thousand by the Sea of Galilee, the attention of Jesus was drawn by Andrew to the lad with five sequent barley loaves and two fishes (Joh 6 History Joh 8.9). At the feast of the Passover, the ...</p>

He had been converted to Christianity before Paul, and, like Paul, had suffered imprisonment, although when and where can only be surmised. When he and Junias, another kinsman of Paul, are referred to as &quot;of note among the apostles,&quot; this may be interpreted as either designating the high esteem in which they were held by the Twelve, or as reckoning them in the number of apostles. The latter is the sense, if &quot;apostle&quot; be understood here in the more general meaning, used in Ac 14:14 of Barnabas, in 2Co 8:23 of Titus, in Php 2:25 of Epaphroditus, and in the Didache of &quot;the traveling evangelists or missionaries who preached the gospel from place to place&quot; (Schaff, The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, 67; see also Lightfoot on Philippians, 196). On this assumption, Andronicus was one of the most prominent and successful of the traveling missionaries of the early church.H. E. Jacobs</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a&#x27;-nem (`anem, &quot;two springs&quot;; Anam): Anem is mentioned with Ramoth among the cities of Issachar assigned to the priests, the sons of Gershom (1Ch 6:73). In the parallel list (Jos 21:29), there are mentioned Jarmuth and En- gannim, corresponding to Ramoth and Anim, therefore Anim and En-gannim (Jenin) are identical. As the name denotes (Anem = &quot;two springs&quot;; En-gannim = &quot;the spring of gardens&quot;), it was well watered. Anem is identified by Eusebius with Aner, but Conder suggests the village of &quot;Anim,&quot; on the hills West of the plain of Esdraelon which represents the Anea of the 4th century AD (Onom under the word &quot;Aniel&quot; and &quot;Bethara&quot;), a city lying 15 Roman miles from Caesarea, which had good baths.M.

Other New Testament ReferencesIV. DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOCTRINEV. THE REALITY OF ANGELSLITERATUREI. Definition and Scripture Terms.The word angel is applied in Scripture to an order of supernatural or heavenly beings whose business it is to act as God&#x27;s messengers to men, and as agents who carry out His will. Both in Hebrew and Greek the word is applied to human messengers (1Ki 19:2; Lu 7:24); in Hebrew it is used in the singular to denote a Divine messenger, and in the plural for human messengers, although there are exceptions to both usages. It is applied to the prophet Haggai (Hag 1:13), to the priest (Mal 2:7), and to the messenger who is to prepare the way of the Lord (Mal 3:1). Other Hebrew words and phrases applied to angels are bene ha-&#x27;elohim (Ge 6:2,4; Job 1:6; 2:1) and bene &#x27;elim (Ps 29:1; 89:6), i.e. sons of the &#x27;elohim or &#x27;elim; this means, according to a common Hebrew usage, members of the class called &#x27;elohim or &#x27;elim, the heavenly powers. It seems doubtful whether the word &#x27;elohim, standing by itself, is ever used to describe angels, although Septuagint so translates it in a few passages.The most notable instance is Ps 8:5; where the Revised Version (British and American) gives, &quot;Thou hast made him but little lower than God,&quot; with the English Revised Version, margin reading of &quot;the angels&quot; for &quot;God&quot; (compare Heb 2:7,9); qedhoshim &quot;holy ones&quot; (Ps 89:5,7), a name suggesting the fact that they belong to God; `ir, `irim, &quot;watcher,&quot; &quot;watchers&quot; (Da 4:13,17,23). Other expressions are used to designate angels collectively: codh, &quot;council&quot; (Ps 89:7), where the reference may be to an inner group of exalted angels; `edhah and qahal, &quot;congregation&quot; (Ps 82:1; 89:5); and finally tsabha&#x27;, tsebha&#x27;oth, &quot;host,&quot; &quot;hosts,&quot; as in the familiar phrase &quot;the God of hosts.&quot;In New Testament the word aggelos, when it refers to a Divine messenger, is frequently accompanied by some phrase which makes this meaning clear, e.g. &quot;the angels of heaven&quot; (Mt 24:36). Angels belong to the &quot;heavenly host&quot; (Lu 2:13). In reference to their nature they are called &quot;spirits&quot; (Heb 1:14). Paul evidently referred to the ordered ranks of supra-mundane beings in a group of words that are found in various combinations, namely, archai, &quot;principalities,&quot; exousiai, &quot;powers,&quot; thronoi, &quot;thrones,&quot; kuriotetes, &quot;dominions,&quot; and dunameis, also translated &quot;powers.&quot; The first four are apparently used in a good sense in Col 1:16, where it is said that all these beings were created through Christ and unto Him; in most of the other passages in which words from this group occur, they seem to represent evil powers. We are told that our wrestling is against them (Eph 6:12), and that Christ triumphs over the principalities ...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">It is evident from the contexts of the various Biblical passages in which the word &quot;angel&quot; appears, that the word does not always represent the same idea. In such passages as Da 12:1 and Ac 12:15 it would seem that the angel was generally regarded as a superhuman being whose duty it was to guard a nation or an individual, not unlike the jenei of the Arabs. However, in Mal 2:7, 3:1 (Hebrew) the word is clearly used to represent men. In the New Testament also, there are passages, such as Jas 2:25 (Greek), in which the word seems to be applied to men. The seven angels of the seven churches (Re 1:20) received seven letters, figurative letters, and therefore it would seem that the seven angels are also figurative and may refer to the seven bishops who presided over the seven churches of Asia. Or the angels may be regarded as the personifications of the churches.E. J. Banks</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">an&#x27;-ger: In the Old Testament, the translation of several Hebrew words, especially of &#x27;aph (lit. &quot;nostril,&quot; &quot;countenance&quot;), which is used some 45 times of human, 177 times of Divine, anger (OHL). The word occurs rarely in the New Testament (Mr 3:5; Eph 4:31; Col 3:8; Re 14:10), its place being taken by the word &quot;wrath&quot; (see WRATH). As a translation of words denoting God&#x27;s &quot;anger,&quot; the English word is unfortunate so far as it may seem to imply selfish, malicious or vindictive personal feeling. The anger of God is the response of His holiness to outbreaking sin. Particularly when it culminates in action is it rightly called Has &quot;wrath.&quot; The Old Testament doctrine of God&#x27;s anger is contained in many passages in the Pentateuch, Psalms and the Prophets. In Proverbs men are dissuaded from anger (Pr 15:1; 27:4), and the &quot;slow to anger&quot; is commended (Pr 15:18; 16:32; 19:11). Christians axe enjoined to put away the feeling of self-regarding, vindictive anger (Eph 4:31; Col 3:8), and to cherish no desire of personal revenge (Eph 4:26).F. K. Farr</p>

Chiefly expressed in Old Testament, by four derivatives of tsuq, &quot;straitened,&quot; &quot;pressed,&quot; and tsar, and two derivatives signifying &quot;straitness,&quot; &quot;narrowness,&quot; hence distress; also shabhats, &quot;giddiness,&quot; &quot;confusion of mind&quot;; hul &quot;to twist&quot; with pain, &quot;writhe.&quot; So in the New Testament, thlipsis, &quot;a pressing together,&quot; hence affliction, tribulation, stenochoria, &quot;narrowness of place,&quot; hence extreme affliction; sunoche, &quot;a holding together,&quot; hence distress. The fundamental idea in these various terms is pressure--being straitened, compressed into a narrow place, or pain through physical or mental torture. Used of the physical agony of child-birth (Jer 4:31; 6:24; 49:24; 50:43; Joh 16:21); of distress of soul as the result of sin and wickedness (Job 15:24; Pr 1:27; Ro 2:9); of anguish of spirit through the cruel bondage of slavery (Ex 6:9) and Assyrian oppression (Isa 8:22); of the anxiety and pain of Christian love because of the sins of fellow-disciples (2Co 2:4).Dwight M.

Exceptionally devout and gifted in spirit, she worshipped so constantly &quot;with fastings and supplications night and day,&quot; that she is said to have &quot;departed not from the temple.&quot; Some have mistakenly supposed that this signified permanent residence in the temple. The fact that her lineage is recorded indicates the distraction of her family. Tradition says that the tribe of Asher was noted for the beauty and talent of its women, who for these gifts, were qualified for royal and high-priestly marriage. While the tribe of Asher was not among the tribes that returned from the Babylonian exile to Palestine, many of its chief families must have done so as in the case of the prophetess. The period of war and national oppression, through which Anna&#x27;s early life was passed, created in her, as in the aged Simeon, an intense longing for the &quot;redemption&quot; promised through the Messiah. See SIMEON. This hope of national deliverance sustained her through more than four decades of patient waiting. In the birth of Jesus her faith was abundantly rewarded, and she became a grateful and ceaseless witness &quot;to all them that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem,&quot; that the day of their spiritual deliverance had come.LITERATURE.See Edersheim, Life and Times of Jesus, I, 200-201, Gelkie, Life and Words of Christ, I, 133-34.Dwight M.

He was the son of Seth (Josephus: Sethi), and was elevated to the high-priesthood by Quirinius, governor of Syria, 7 AD. At this period the office was filled and vacated at the caprice of the Roman procurators, and Annas was deposed by Valerius Gratus, 15 AD. But though deprived of official status, he continued to wield great power as the dominant member of the hierarchy, using members of his family as his willing instruments. That he was an adroit diplomatist is shown by the fact that five of his sons (Ant., XX, ix, 1) and his son- in-law Caiaphas (Joh 18:13) held the high-priesthood in almost unbroken succession, though he did not survive to see the office filled by his fifth son Annas or Ananus II, who caused Jas the Lord&#x27;s brother to be stoned to death (circa 62 AD). Another mark of his continued influence is, that long after he had lost his office he was still called &quot;high priest,&quot; and his name appears first wherever the names of the chief members of the sacerdotal faction are given. Ac 4:6, &quot;And Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.&quot; Annas is almost certainly called high priest in Joh 18:19,22, though in Joh 18:13,24 Caiaphas is mentioned as the high priest. Note especially the remarkable phrase in Lu 3:2, &quot;in the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas,&quot; as if they were joint holders of the office. The cases In which Josephus gives the title &quot;high-priest&quot; to persons who no longer held the office afford no real parallel to this. The explanation seems to be that owing to age, ability and force of character Annas was the virtual, though Caiaphas the titular, high priest. He belonged to the Sadducean aristocracy, and, like others of that class, he seems to have been arrogant, astute, ambitious and enormously wealthy. He and his family were proverbial for their rapacity and greed.The chief source of their wealth seems to have been the sale of requisites for the temple sacrifices, such as sheep, doves, wine and oil, which they carried on in the four famous &quot;booths of the sons of Annas&quot; on the Mount of Olives, with a branch within the precincts of the temple itself. During the great feasts, they were able to extort high monopoly prices for theft goods. Hence, our Lord&#x27;s strong denunciation of those who made the house of prayer &quot;a den of robbers&quot; (Mr 11:15-19), and the curse in the Talmud, &quot;Woe to the family of Annas! Woe to the serpent- like hisses&quot; (Pes 57a). As to the part he played in the trial and death of our Lord, although he does not figure very prominently in the gospel narratives, he seems to have been mainly responsible for the course of events.

For the first idea, the Hebrew employs kaphar = &quot;to cover,&quot; &quot;to expiate,&quot; &quot;condone,&quot; &quot;placate,&quot; &quot;cancel,&quot; &quot;cleanse,&quot; &quot;disannul,&quot; &quot;purge,&quot; &quot;put off&quot; (Isa 28:18); and the Greek (Ga 3:15), atheteo = &quot;to set aside,&quot; &quot;disesteem,&quot; &quot;neutralize,&quot; &quot;violate,&quot; &quot;frustrate.&quot; One covenant disannulling another by &quot;conflict of laws&quot; is expressed by akuroo, &quot;to invalidate,&quot; &quot;disannul,&quot; &quot;make of no effect.&quot; Atheteo is employed to express also the disannulling through age and disuse (Heb 7:18).Frank E.

It originated from the relief from the effect of the sun that was experienced in rubbing the body with oil or grease. Among rude people the common vegetable or animal fat was used. As society advanced and refinement became a part of civilization, delicately perfumed ointments were used for this purpose. Other reasons soon obtained for this practice than that stated above. Persons were anointed for health (Mr 6:13), because of the widespread belief in the healing power of oil. It was often employed as a mark of hospitality (Lu 7:46); as a mark of special honor (Joh 11:2); in preparation for social occasions (Ru 3:3; 2Sa 14:2; Isa 61:3). The figurative use of this word (chrio) has reference strictly to the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the individual (Lu 4:18; Ac 4:27; 10:38). In this sense it is God who anoints (Heb 1:9; 2Co 1:21). The thought is to appoint, or qualify for a special dignity, function or privilege. It is in this sense that the word is applied to Christ (Joh 1:41 m; Ac 4:27; 10:38; Heb 1:9; compare Ps 2:2; Da 9:25).See also ANOINTING.Jacob W. Kapp</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-noint&#x27;-ing: A distinction was made by the ancient Hebrews between anointing with oil in private use, as in making one&#x27;s toilet (cukh), and anointing as a religious rite (mashach).1. Ordinary Use:(1) As regards its secular or ordinary use, the native olive oil, alone or mixed with perfumes, was commonly used for toilet purposes, the very poor naturally reserving it for special occasions only (Ru 3:3). The fierce protracted heat and biting lime dust of Palestine made the oil very soothing to the skin, and it was applied freely to exposed parts of the body, especially to the face (Ps 104:15).(2) The practice was in vogue before David&#x27;s time, and traces of it may be found throughout the Old Testament (see De 28:40; Ru 3:3; 2Sa 12:20; 14:2; 2 Chron 28:15; Eze 16:9; Mic 6:15; Da 10:3) and in the New Testament (Mt 6:17, etc.). Indeed it seems to have been a part of the daily toilet throughout the East.(3) To abstain from it was one token of mourning (2Sa 14:2; compare Mt 6:17), and to resume it a sign that the mourning was ended (2Sa 12:20; 14:2; Da 10:3; Judith 10:3). It often accompanied the bath (Ru 3:3; 2Sa 12:20; Eze 16:9; Susanna 17), and was a customary part of the preparation for a feast (Ec 9:8; Ps 23:5). One way of showing honor to a guest was to anoint his head with oil (Ps 23:5; Lu 7:46); a rarer and more striking way was to anoint his feet (Lu 7:38). In Jas 5:14, we have an instance of anointing with oil for medicinal purposes, for which see OIL.2. Religious Use:Anointing as a religious rite was practiced throughout the ancient East in application both to persons and to things.(1) It was observed in Canaan long before the Hebrew conquest, and, accordingly, Weinel (Stade&#x27;s Zeutschrift, XVIII, 50 ff) holds that, as the use of oil for general purposes in Israel was an agricultural custom borrowed from the Canaanites, so the anointing with sacred oil was an outgrowth from its regular use for toilet purposes. It seems more in accordance with the known facts of the case and the terms used in description to accept the view set forth by Robertson Smith (Religion of the Semites, 2nd ed., 233, 383 ff; compare Wellhausen, Reste des arabischen Heidenthums, 2nd ed., 125 ff) and to believe that the cukh or use of oil for toilet purposes, was of agricultural and secular origin, and that the use of oil for sacred purposes, mashach, was in origin nomadic and sacrificial. Robertson Smith finds the origin of the sacred anointing in the very ancient custom of smearing the sacred fat on the altar (matstsebhah), and claims, rightly it would seem, that from the first there was a distinct and consistent usage, distinguishing the two terms as above.(2) The primary meaning of mashach in Hebrew, which is borne out by the Arabic, seems to have been &quot;to daub&quot; or &quot;smear.&quot; It is used of painting a ceiling in Jer 22:14, of anointing a shield in Isa 21:5, and is, accordingly, consistently applied to sacred furniture, like the altar, in Ex 29:36 and Da 9:24, and to the sa...</p>

See the many passages that read: &quot;The Lord answered and said.&quot;(4) The other words translated &quot;answer&quot; or &quot;answered&quot; in the Old Testament are unimportant shadings and variations.2. In the New Testament:The words translated &quot;answer&quot; are not so varied.(1) It sometimes means an apology, a defense (1Pe 3:15; Ac 24:10,25).(2) It may mean simply &quot;to say&quot; (Mr 9:6).(3) It may mean a revelation from God (Ro 11:4).(4) It is also used to apply to unspoken thoughts of the heart, especially in the sayings of Jesus; also by Peter to Sapphira (Ac 5:8).G.

The Ten Antediluvian Patriarchs:Ten patriarchs who lived before the Flood are listed in the genealogical table of Ge 5, together with a statement of the age of each at the birth of his son, the number of years that remained to him till death, and the sum of both periods or the entire length of his life. The first half of the list, from Adam to Mahalalel inclusive, together with Enoch and Noah is the same in the three texts, except that the Septuagint has 100 years more in the first column in each case save that of Noah, and 100 years less in the second column. See CHRONOLOGY OF THE OLD TESTAMENT.2. Divergences between the Three Texts:Divergence exists in the case of Jared, Methuselah and Lamech only. Even here the longevity of Jared and Methuselah is given similarly in the Hebrew and the Septuagint; and probably represents the reading of the source, especially since the different data in the Samaritan text bear evidence of adjustment to a theory. The customary excess of 100 years in the Septuagint over the other texts for the age of the patriarch at the birth of the son, and the variously divergent data for the total age of Jared, Methuselah and Lamech are, therefore, the matters that await explanation.The general superiority of the Hebrew text of the Pentateuch as a whole to the Samaritan text and the Septuagint is no longer questioned by Biblical scholars. But whether the superiority obtains in this particular passage has given rise to long and earnest discussion. Keil and Delitzsch in their commentaries on Genesis, Preuss (Zeitrechnung der Septuaginta, 1859, 30ff), Noldeke (Untersuchung zur Kritik des Altes Testament, 1869, 112), and Eduard Konig (ZKW, 1883, 281 ff), hold to the originality of the Hebrew data. Bertheau (Jahrbucher fur deutsche Theologie, XXIII, 657 ff) and Dillmann ascribe prior authority to the Samaritan numbers in Ge 5, but to the Hebrew numbers in Ge 11. Klostermann argues for the originality of the Septuagint (Pentateuch, Neue Folge, 1907, 37- 39).3. Divergences not Accidental:It is agreed by all that the divergences between the texts are mainly due, not to accidental corruption, but to systematic alteration. Accordingly, two tasks devolve upon the investigator, namely(1) the removal of accidental corruptions from the numerical data in the several texts and(2) the discovery of a principle that underlies and explains the peculiarities in each one or in two of the three sets of data.4. Different Explanations:On the interpretation that the names denote individuals and that no links have been omitted in the genealogy, readers of the Septuagint noticed that according to its data Methuselah survived the flood, and in order to avoid this incongruity a scribe changed the 167 years, ascribed to his age at the birth of his son, to 187 years. This reading was early in existence, and was followed by Josephus. Holding the same theory regarding the genealogy, the Samaritans noticed that by their data t...</p>

Chronology Uncertain:According to the ordinary interpretation of the genealogical tables in Ge 5 the lives of the antediluvians were prolonged to an extreme old age, Methuselah attaining that of 969 years. But before accepting these figures as a basis of interpretation it is important to observe that the Hebrew, the Samaritan and the Septuagint texts differ so radically in their sums that probably little confidence can be placed in any of them. The Septuagint adds 100 years to the age of six of the antediluvian patriarchs at the birth of their eldest sons. This, taken with the great uncertainty connected with the transmission of numbers by the Hebrew method of notation, makes it unwise to base important conclusions upon the data accessible. The most probable interpretation of the genealogical table in Ge 5 is that given by the late Professor William Henry Green, who maintains that it is not Intended to give chronology, and does not give it, but only indicates the line of descent, as where (1Ch 26:24) we read that &quot;Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler over the treasures&quot;; whereas, while Gershom was the immediate son of Moses, Shebuel was separated from Gershom by several generations. According to the interpretation of Professor Green all that we can certainly infer from the statement in Hebrew that Adam was 130 years old when he begat Seth, is that at that age the line branched off which culminated in Seth, it being permitted, according to Hebrew usage, to interpolate as many intermediate generations as other evidence may compel.2. Meaning of Genealogies:As in the genealogies of Christ in the Gospels, the object of the tables in Genesis is evidently not to give chronology, but the line of descent. This conclusion is supported by the fact that no use is made afterward of the chronology, whereas the line of descent is repeatedly emphasized. This method of interpretation allows all the elasticity to prehistoric chronology that any archaeologist may require. Some will get further relief from the apparent incredibility of the figures by the Interpretation of Professor A. Winchell, and T. P. Crawford (Winchell, Pre-adamites, 449 ff) that the first number gives the age of actual life of the individual while the second gives that of the ascendancy of his family, the name being that of dynasties, like Caesar or Pharaoh.3. The Nephilim:The nephilim (giants) and the mighty men born of &quot;the sons of God&quot; and the &quot;daughters of men&quot; (Ge 6:4,5) are according to the best interpretation &quot;giants in wickedness,&quot; being the fruit of intermarriage between the descendants of Seth (&quot;sons of God&quot; who called on the name of Yahweh, Ge 4:26), and the &quot;daughters of men.&quot; The idea that &quot;sons of God&quot; refers to angels or demigods has no support in Scripture. On this familiar designation of the worshippers of the true God see Ex 4:22; De 1:41; 32, repeatedly; Isa 1:2; 43:6; 45:11; Ho 1:10; 11:1. Intermarriage with depraved races such as is...</p>

Probably the only other antelope within this range is the Arabian oryx (Oryx beatrix). Tristram cites two African species (the bubaline antelope, Bubalis mauretanica, and the addax, Addax nasomaculatus) as existing in the Sinaitic peninsula, southern Palestine and Arabia, but he did not collect specimens of either and was probably misled by statements of the Arabs which in both cases really referred to the oryx. The only naturalist who has ever penetrated into Northwest Arabia is Mr. Douglas Carruthers, who went in 1909 on a collecting expedition for the Syrian Protestant College at Beirut, his object being to obtain the oryx and any other large antelopes which might be found there. Through observation and repeated inquiry he became convinced that neither the addax nor the bubaline antelope is found in Arabia. Tristram says the addax is called maha&#x27; and the bubaline antelope baqar-ul-wachsh, both of which names are in fact used by the Arabs for the oryx, which is also according to Doughty called wadichah.Tsebhi in the list of clean animals in De 14:5 (the King James Version &quot;roebuck&quot;; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;gazelle&quot;) is quite certainly gazelle, Arabic zabi (which see), so it is quite possible that te&#x27;o may be the oryx. It is noteworthy that it is rendered oryx (orux) in the Septuagint. It must be borne in mind that re&#x27;m or re&#x27;em, rendered &quot;unicorn&quot; (which see) in the King James Version and &quot;wild ox&quot; in the Revised Version (British and American), may perhaps also be the oryx. That the oryx should be called by two names in the Bible need not be considered strange, in view of the indefiniteness of Semitic ideas of natural history, which is directly evidenced by the three names now used for this animal by the Arabs.The slightly different form [to&#x27;] (the King James Version &quot;wild bull&quot;; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;antelope&quot;) found in Isa 51:20 (&quot;Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net&quot;) may quite as well refer to the oryx as to any other animal. According to Gesenius the word is derived from the verb ta&#x27;ah, &quot;to outrun,&quot; which would be appropriate for this or any antelope.The accompanying illustration is from a photograph of a well-grown female oryx in the zoological gardens at Cairo, which is 35 inches high at the shoulder and whose horns are 21 inches long. An adult male measures 40 inches at the shoulders, 59 inches from tip of nose to root of tail, and the longest horns known measure 27 1/4 inches. The color i...</p>

The New Evolutionism5. Evolution and GenesisVI. PRIMITIVE AND PRESENT CONDITIONS OF MAN: ANTIQUITY OF MANLITERATUREUnder this heading is grouped whatever the Bible has to say regarding man&#x27;s origin, nature, destiny and kindred topics. No systematized doctrine concerning man is found in Scripture; but the great facts about human nature and its elements are presented in the Bible in popular language and not in that of the schools. Delitzsch has well said: &quot;There is a clearly defined psychology essentially proper to Holy Scripture, which underlies all the Biblical writers, and intrinsically differs from that many formed psychology which lies outside the circle of revelation. .... We do not need first of all to force the Biblical teaching: it is one in itself&quot; (Biblical Psychology, 17, 18). What is said of the psychology of Scripture may with good reason be applied to its anthropology.I. Terms Employed.Several words are used in the Old Testament for our word &quot;Man.&quot;1. &#x27;Adham:&#x27;adham, either as the name of the first man, (compare Lu 3:38; Ro 5:14; 1Co 15:45); or as an appellative--the man; or, as the generic name of the human race (Septuagint: anthropos; Vulgate: homo). The origin of the name is obscure. In Ge 2:7 Adam is connected with &#x27;adhamah, from the earthly part of man&#x27;s nature (dust out of the &#x27;adhamah), as the earth-born one. The derivation of Adam from &#x27;adhamah, however, is disputed--among others by Dillmann: &quot;Sprachlich lasst sich die Ableitung aus Adamah nicht vertheidigen&quot; (Genesis, 53). Delitzsch refers to Josephus (Ant., I, i, 2), who maintained that Adam really meant purrhos (&quot;red as fire&quot;), in reference to the redness of the earth, out of which man was formed. &quot;He means,&quot; adds Delitzsch, &quot;the wonderfully fruitful and aromatic red earth of the Hauran chum of mountains, which is esteemed of marvelously strong and healing power, and which is believed to be self-rejuvenescent&quot; (N. Commentary on Gen, 118). The connection with Edom in Ge 25:30 may perhaps point in the same direction. A connection has also been sought with the Assyrian admu (&quot;child&quot;), especially the young of the bird, in the sense of making or producing (Delitzsch; Oxford Dictionary); while Dillmann draws attention to an Ethiopic root adma, &quot;pleasant,&quot; &quot;agreeable,&quot; &quot;charming&quot;--a derivation, however, which he rejects. Suffice it to say, that no certain derivation has yet been found for the term (thus Dillmann, &quot;ein sicheres Etymon fur Adam ist noch nicht gefunden,&quot; Gen, 53). Evidently in the word the earthly side of man&#x27;s origin is indicated.2. Son of Man: The phrase ben-&#x27;adham, &quot;son of man&quot; (Nu 23:19; Job 25:6; Eze 2:3) is frequently found to denote man&#x27;s frailty and unworthiness in the sight of God. So in the much-disput...</p>

Twofold Nature of the Anthropomorphic Difficulty13. Need of Rising Higher14. God in Christ the True Solution1. Definition of the Term:By this term is meant, conformably with its etymological signification, i.e. as being in the form or likeness of man, the attribution to God of human form, parts or passions, and the taking of Scripture passages which speak of God as having hands, or eyes, or ears, in a literal sense. This anthropomorphic procedure called forth Divine rebuke so early as Ps 50:21: &quot;Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself.&quot;2. Old Testament Anthropomorphisms:Fear of the charge of anthropomorphism has had a strangely deterrent effect upon many minds, but very needlessly so. Even that rich storehouse of apparently crude anthropomorphisms, the Old Testament, when it ascribes to Deity physical characters, mental and moral attributes, like those of man, merely means to make the Divine nature and operations intelligible, not to transfer to Him the defects and limitations of human character and life.3. In What Senses an Anthropomorphic Element Is Necessity:In all really theistic forms of religion, there is an anthropomorphic element present, for they all presuppose the psychological truth of a certain essential likeness between God and man. Nor, perfect as we may our theistic idea or conception of Deity, can we, in the realm of spirit, ever wholly eliminate the anthropomorphic element involved in this assumption, without which religion itself were not. It is of the essence of the religious consciousness to recognize the analogy subsisting between God&#x27;s relations to man, and man&#x27;s relations to his fellow. We are warned off from speaking of &quot;the Divine will&quot; or &quot;the Divine purpose,&quot; as too anthropomorphic--savoring too much of simple humanity and human psychology--and are bidden speak only of &quot;the Divine immanence&quot; or &quot;the Divine ground of our being.&quot;4. Anthropomorphism and the Exigencies of Human Thinking:But these speculative objections really spring from a shallow interpretation of the primary facts of human consciousness, which, in the deepest realm of inner experience, claims the indefeasible right to speak of the Divine nature in human terms, as may best be possible to our being. The proper duty or function of philosophy is to take due account of such direct and primary facts of our nature: the basal facts of our being cannot be altered to suit her convenience.5.

In the Old Testament.Antichrist in the Old Testament:As in the Old Testament the doctrine concerning Christ was only suggested, not developed, so is it with the doctrine of the Antichrist. That the Messiah should be the divine Logos, the only adequate expression of God, was merely hinted at, not stated: so Antichrist was exhibited as the opponent of God rather than of His anointed. In the historical books of the Old Testament we find &quot;Belial&quot; used as if a personal opponent of Yahweh; thus the scandalously wicked are called in the King James Version &quot;sons of Belial&quot; (Jud 19:22; 20:13), &quot;daughter of Belial&quot; (1Sa 1:16), etc. The the Revised Version (British and American) translates the expression in an abstract sense, &quot;base fellows,&quot; &quot;wicked woman.&quot; In Da 7:7,8 there is the description of a great heathen empire, represented by a beast with ten horns: its full antagonism to God is expressed in a little eleventh horn which had &quot;a mouth speaking great things&quot; and &quot;made war with the saints&quot; (Da 7:8,21). Him the `Ancient of Days&#x27; was to destroy, and his kingdom was to be given to a `Son of Man&#x27; (Da 7:9-14). Similar but yet differing in many points is the description of Antiochus Epiphanes in Da 8:9-12,23-25.II. In the New Testament.1. The Gospels:In the Gospels the activity of Satan is regarded as specially directed against Christ. In the Temptation (Mt 4:1-10; Lu 4:1-13) the Devil claims the right to dispose of &quot;all the kingdoms of the world,&quot; and has his claim admitted. The temptation is a struggle between the Christ and the Antichrist. In the parable of the Tares and the Wheat, while He that sowed the good seed is the Son of Man, he that sowed the tares is the Devil, who is thus Antichrist (Mt 13:37-39). our Lord felt it the keenest of insults that His miracles should be attributed to Satanic assistance (Mt 12:24-32). In Joh 14:30 there is reference to the &quot;Prince of the World&quot; who &quot;hath nothing&quot; in Christ.2. Pauline Epistles:The Pauline epistles present a more developed form of the doctrine. In the spiritual sphere Paul identifies Antichrist with Belial. &quot;What concord hath Christ with Belial?&quot; (2Co 6:15). 2 Thessalonians, written early, affords evidence of a considerably developed doctrine being commonly accepted among believers. The exposition of 2Th 2:3-9, in which Paul exhibits his teaching on the `Man of Sin,&#x27; is very difficult, as may be seen from the number of conflicting attempts at its interpretation. See MAN OF SIN. Here we would only indicate what seems to us the most plausible view of the Pauline doctrine. It had been revealed to t...</p>

Guided, it was said, by the flight of an eagle, he fixed its site on the left bank of the Orontes (the El-`Asi) about 15 miles from the sea. He also rounded and fortified Seleucia to be the port of his new capital.The city was enlarged and embellished by successive kings of the Seleucid Dynasty, notably by Seleucus Callinicus (246-226 BC), and Antiochus Epiphanes (175-164 BC). In 83 BC, on the collapse of the Seleucid monarchy, Antioch fell into the hands of Tigranes, king of Armenia, who held Syria until his defeat by the Romans fourteen years later. In 64 BC the country was definitely annexed to Rome by Pompey, who granted considerable privileges to Antioch, which now became the capital of the Roman province of Syria. In the civil wars which terminated in the establishment of the Roman principate, Antioch succeeded in attaching itself constantly to the winning side, declaring for Caesar after the fall of Pompey, and for Augustus after the battle of Actium. A Roman element was added to its population, and several of the emperors contributed to its adornment. Already a splendid city under the Seleucids, Antioch was made still more splendid by its Roman patrons and masters. It was the &quot;queen of the East,&quot; the third city, after Rome and Alexandria, of the Roman world. About five miles distant from the city was the suburb of Daphne, a spot sacred to Apollo and Artemis.This suburb, beautified by groves and fountains, and embellished by the Seleucids and the Romans with temples and baths, was the pleasure resort of the city, and &quot;Daphnic morals&quot; became a by-word. From its foundation Antioch was a cosmopolitan city. Though not a seaport, its situation was favorable to commercial development, and it absorbed much of the trade of the Levant. Seleucus Nicator had settled numbers of Jews in it, granting them equal rights with the Greeks (Ant., XII, iii, 1). Syrians, Greeks, Jews, and in later days, Romans, constituted the main elements of the population. The citizens were a vigorous, turbulent and pushing race, notorious for their commercial aptitude, the licentiousness of their pleasures, and the scurrility of their wit. Literature and the arts, however, were not neglected.In the early history of Christianity, Antioch occupies a distinguished place. The large and flourishing Jewish colony offered an immediate field for Christian teaching, and the cosmopolitanism of the city tended to widen the outlook of the Christian community, which refused to be confined within the narrow limits of Judaism. Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch, was one of the first deacons (Ac 6:5). Antioch was the cradle of GentileChristianity and of Christian missionary enterprise. It was at the instance of the church at Antioch that the council at Jerusalem decided to relieve Gentil...</p>

History:(1) Antioch of Pisidia was so called to distinguish it from the many other cities of the same name founded by Seleucus Nicator (301-280 BC) and called after his father Antiochus. It was situated in a strong position, on a plateau close to the western bank of the river Anthios, which flows down from the Sultan Dagh to the double lake called Limnai (Egerdir Gol). It was planted on the territory of a great estate belonging to the priests of the native religion; the remaining portions of this estate belonged later to the Roman emperors, and many inscriptions connected with the cult of the emperors, who succeeded to the Divine as well as to the temporal rights of the god, have survived. (See Sir W. M. Ramsay&#x27;s paper on &quot;The Tekmoreian Guest-Friends&quot; in Studies in the History and Art of the Eastern Roman Provinces, 1906.) The plateau on which Antioch stood commands one of the roads leading from the East to the Meander and Ephesus; the Seleucid kings regularly founded their cities in Asia Minor at important strategical points, to strengthen their hold on the native tribes.There is no evidence that a Greek city existed on the site of Antioch before the foundation of Seleucus. Ramsay must be right in connecting Strabo&#x27;s statement that Antioch was colonized by Greeks from Magnesia on the Meander with the foundation by Seleucus; for it is extremely unlikely that Greeks could have built and held a city in such a dangerous position so far inland before the conquest of Alexander. Pre-Alexandrian Greek cities are seldom to be found in the interior of Asia Minor, and then only in the open river valleys of the west. But there must have been a Phrygian fortress at or near Antioch when the Phrygian kings were at the height of their power. The natural boundary of Phrygian territory in this district is the Pisidian Mts., and the Phrygians could only have held the rich valley between the Sultan Dagh and Egerdir Lake against the warlike tribes of the Pisidian mountains on condition that they had a strong settlement in the neighborhood. We shall see below that the Phrygians did occupy this side of the Sultan Dagh, controlling the road at a critical point.The Seleucid colonists were Greeks, Jews and Phrygians, if we may judge by the analogy of similar Seleucid foundations. That there were Jews in Antioch is proved by Ac 13:14,50, and by an inscription of Apollonia, a neighboring city, mentioning a Jewess Deborah, whose ancestors had held office in Antioch (if Ramsay&#x27;s interpretation of the inscription, The Cities of Paul, 256, is correct). In 189 BC, after the peace with Antiochus the Great, the Romans made Antioch a &quot;free city&quot;; this does not mean that any change was made in its constitution but only that it ceased to pay tribute to the Seleucid kings. Antony gave Antioch to Amyntas of Galatia in 39 BC, and hence it was included in the province Galatia (see GALATIA) forme...</p>

His determined policy was to Hellenize his entire kingdom. The greatest obstacle to his ambition was the fidelity of the Jews to their historic religion. Many worldly Hebrews, however, for material advantage were willing to apostatize, among them, Jason, the brother of the faithful high priest Onias III. With a large sum of money (2 Macc 4:7-10) he bribed Antiochus to appoint him high priest in his brother&#x27;s stead. This office, being, since Ezra&#x27;s time, political as well as religious, made him virtually the head of the nation.He promised, on condition the king would permit him to build a Greek gymnasium at Jerusalem, &quot;to train up the youth of his race in the fashions of the heathen,&quot; and to enrol the Hellenized people as Antiochians, i.e. to give all Jews who would adopt Greek customs and the Greek religion the rights and privileges of citizens of Antioch. The granting of this request made Jason the head of the Greek party at Jerusalem. &quot;Such was the height of Greek fashions, and the increase of heathenish manners&quot; under his perverted high-priesthood, that the priests under him lost courage to &quot;serve any more at the altar, but despising the temple and neglecting the sacrifices, hastened&quot; to ally themselves with the Grecians.When the sacrifice of Hercules was observed in connection with the Grecian games at Tyre &quot;Jason sent special messengers from Jerusalem, who were Antiochians&quot; (2 Macc 4:19) with a large contribution of money. This Hellenizing program was supported by a decree of Antiochus which enjoined uniformity of worship throughout his dominions. He forbade the further observance of Jewish festivals, Sabbath, sacrifices in the temple and the rite of circumcision. His ambition included the like subjugation of Egypt, but being thwarted in his expedition thither by Roman envoys, he returned to Jerusalem to vent his anger on the Jews who refused to deny the faith of their fathers. The persecutions inflicted by the king upon these devout Jews abounded in every atrocity. All sacred books of the law that could be found were burned. This attempt to Hellenize the Jews was pushed to every remote rural village of Palestine. The universal peril led the Samaritans, eager for safety, to repudiate all connection and kinship with the Jews. They sent ambassadors and an epistle asking to be recognized as belonging to the Greek party, and to have their temple on Mt. Gerizim named &quot;The Temple of Jupiter Hellenius.&quot; The request was granted. This was evidently the final breach between the two races indicated in Joh 4:9, &quot;For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.&quot;Among those who refused to be enrolled as Antiochians was Mattathias, an aged priest of the order of Joarib. Mourning the terrible profanation of the holy city and temple he retired with his five sons to his ancestral estates among the mountains Northwest of Jerusale...</p>

His father, when he discovered the cause of his son&#x27;s illness, gave her to him in 293, and yielded to him the sovereignty over all the countries beyond the Euphrates, as well as the title of king. When Seleucus returned to Macedonia in 281, he was murdered by Ptolemeus Ceraunus. Antiochus thus became ruler of the whole Syrian kingdom. He waged war on Eumenes of Pergamum, but without success. For the victories of his elephant corps over the Gauls, who had settled in Asia Minor, he received the surname of Soter (&quot;Deliverer&quot;). It was in a battle with these inveterate foes of his country that he met his death (261 BC). See also SELEUCIDAE.J. E. Harry</p>

He made a successful war on Ptolemy Philadelphus of Egypt, but was obliged to buy peace in 250 by divorcing his wife, Laodice, and by marrying Ptolemy&#x27;s daughter, Berenice. After the death of Ptolemy, &quot;the king of the south&quot; (Da 11:6) 248 BC, he recalled Laodice and named her eldest son (Seleucus Kallinikos) as his successor to the throne; but Laodice (probably because she feared a second repudiation) had Berenice, her child, and Antiochus all murdered (246 BC). The Milesians gave him the surname of Theos in gratitude for his liberating them from the tyranny of Timarchus.

Theodotus surrendered to him Tyre, Ptolemais and his naval fleet. Rhodes and Cyzicus, as well as Byzantium and Aetolia, desired peace, but Antiochus declined to accept their terms. He renewed the war, but was defeated at Raphia in 217, and was obliged to give up Phoenicia and Coelesyria; Seleucia, however, he retained. He undertook to bring under his sway again all the territory of the Far East. His expedition against Bactria and Parthia gained for him the surname of &quot;The Great.&quot; In 209 he carried away the treasure of the goddess Aine in Ecbatana, defeated the Parthians, and in 208 marched against the Bactrians. Later he made a treaty with an Indian rajah, and then returned to the West by way of Arachosia and Carmania, forcing the Gerraean Arabs to furnish him with frankincense, myrrh and silver. Then he took Ephesus, which he made his headquarters. In 196 he had crossed the Hellespont and rebuilt Lysimachia. Hannibal visited Antiochus in Ephesus the next year and became one of the king&#x27;s advisers. He sought the friendship also of Eumenes of Pergamum, but without success.Rome now requested the king not to interfere in Europe, or to recognize the right of the Romans to protect the Greeks in Asia. A war broke out in 192, and Antiochus was persuaded to come to Greece. The Aetolians elected him their general, who asked the Acheans to remain neutral. But the patriotic Philopoemen decided that an alliance with Rome was to be preferred. Antiochus first captured Calchis; then succeeded in gaining a footing in Boeotia, and later made an effort to get possession of Thessaly, but retired on the approach of the Macedonian army. In 191 the Romans made a formal declaration of war on Antiochus, who, being at that time in Acarnania, returned to Calchis, and finally sailed back to Ephesus. The Romans regained possession of Boeotia, Euboea and Sestus; but Polyxenidas defeated the Roman fleet near Samos, which island, together with Cyme and Phocaea, fell into the hands of Antiochus. The victorious Polyxenidas, however, soon sustained a crushing defeat at the hands of the Romans, and Antiochus abandoned Lysimachia, leaving an open road to Asia to the Romans. He was finally defeated at Magnesia and sent word to Scipio, who was at Sardis, that he was willing to make peace; but Scipio ordered him to send envoys to Rome. A decision was reached in 189; the Asiatic monarch was obliged to renounce everything on the Roman side of the Taurus; give up all his ships of war but ten and pay 15,000 talents to Rome, and 500 to Eumenes. Antiochus marched against the revolted Armenians in 187. In order to replenish his exhausted treasury, he attempted to plunder a temple and both he and his soldiers were slain by the Elymeans.LITERATURE.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(Epiphanes, e-pif&#x27;-a-naz, &quot;Illustrious&quot;): Son of Antiochus III who became king after his brother, Seleucus IV, had been murdered by Heliodorus. As a boy Antiochus lived at Rome as a hostage. The Pergamene monarchs, Eumenes and Attalus, succeeded in placing upon the throne the brother of Seleucus, although Heliodorus had wished to ascend the throne himself. The young king was even more enterprising than his father. He was called in to settle a quarrel between Onias III and his brother, Jason, the leader of the Hellenizing faction in Jerusalem, and Onias was driven out (2 Macc 4:4-6). Jason became high priest in his stead (2 Macc 4:9-16; 1 Macc 1:10-15; Ant, XII, v, 1). Antiochus himself afterward visited Jerusalem and was signally honored (2 Macc 4:22). On the death of Ptolemy VI in 173, Antiochus laid claim to Coelesyria, Palestine and Phoenicia; whereupon war broke out between Syria and Egypt. In this war Antiochus was victorious. Ptolemy Philometor was taken prisoner, and Antiochus had himself crowned king of Egypt (171-167 BC) at Memphis; whereupon Alexandria revolted and chose Ptolemy&#x27;s brother as their king. The Roman ambassador, Popilius Laenas, demanded the surrender of Egypt and the immediate withdrawal of its self-constituted king. Antiochus yielded; gave up Pelusium and withdrew his fleet from Cyprus, but retained Coelesyria, Palestine and Phoenicia.While Antiochus was on a second campaign in Egypt, he heard of the siege of Jerusalem. He returned immediately, slew many thousands of the inhabitants and robbed the temple of its treasures (1 Macc 1:20-24; 2 Macc 5:11-21). By his prohibition of the Jewish worship and his introduction or substitution of the worship of the Olympian Zeus (1 Macc 1:54; 2 Macc 6:2; Ant, XII, v, 4) he brought about the insurrection of the Jews, under the Maccabees, upon whom he made an unsuccessful war in 167-164 BC. After this war Antiochus retired to the eastern provinces and died, after having failed in an attack on the temple of the Sun in Elymais, in Persia. See also ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION; ANTIOCHIANS.J.

Antiochus then besieged Jerusalem. Peace was finally concluded on the condition that the Jews should not be compelled to change any of their national customs (1 Macc 6:55-60; Ant, XII, ix, 7). Philip, the king&#x27;s foster-brother (2 Macc 9:29), was defeated at Antioch, but soon afterward Lysias and Antiochus were themselves defeated by Demetrius Soter, son of Seleucus Philopator (1 Macc 7:4; 2 Macc 14:2; Ant, XII, x, 1; Polyb. xxxi.19; Livy Epit. 46).J.

Alexander left the throne to his son in 146 BC. The young king retired to Arabia--perhaps through compulsion. The shrewd diplomatist and skillful general, Tryphon, succeeded first in winning over to his side the two leaders of the Jews, Jonathan and Simon, and then, by force of arms, in making the Syrians recognize his protege. As soon as the monarchy had been firmly established, Tryphon unmasked his projects: he had been ambitious only for himself; Antiochus had been only an instrument in his hands. In 143; after a reign of a little more than three years, Antiochus was assassinated by Tryphon, who ascended the throne himself (1 Macc 13:31; Ant, XIII, vii, 1; Livy Epit. 55).J. E. Harry</p>

An Indian origin may be inferred from the fact that the Hebrew qoph, the Greek kebos and the English &quot;ape&quot; are akin to the Sanskrit &quot;kapi&quot;, which is referred to the root kap, kamp, &quot;to tremble&quot;; but the question of the source of these imports depends upon what is understood by TARSHISH and OPHIR (which see). Canon Cheyne in Encyclopedia Biblica (s.v. &quot;Peacock&quot;) proposes a reading which would give &quot;gold, silver, ivory and precious stones&quot; instead of &quot;gold, silver, ivory, apes and peacocks.&quot; Assuming, however, that animals are here referred to, the word ape should be understood to mean some kind of monkey. The word &quot;ape&quot; is sometimes used for the tail-less apes or anthropoids such as the gorilla, the chimpanzee and the orangutang, as opposed to the tailed kinds, but this distinction is not strictly held to, and the usage seems formerly to have been freer than now.Alfred Ely Day</p>

The tribe has not yet been recognized with any certainty in the inscriptions. Rawlinson identifies them with the Persians; other scholars deny that any Assyrian king was ever so situated as to have been able to obtain colonists from Persia. Some maintain with Marquardt that the term is not the name of a tribe, but the title of certain officers under Darius. Fred. Delitzsch suggests the inhabitants of one of the two great Medean towns &quot;Partakka&quot; and &quot;Partukka&quot; mentioned in Esarhaddon&#x27;s inscriptions.

It was a royal city of the Canaanites whose king was slain by Josh. Probably it is the Aphek mentioned by Josephus as being near to Antipatris (BJ, II, xix, 1). Kakon, a strong position commanding the main entrance to Samaria might suit; but the name has perished.(2) (Greek Taphek or Apheka): A city in the lot of Asher (Jos 13:4). The inhabitants were not ejected by Asher, nor is it said that they became tributary (Jud 1:31). In this passage it is written &#x27;aphiq (Hebrew). It may be represented by &#x27;Afqa on Nahr Ibrahim, although this is probably farther north than we should expect.(3) To this place the Philistines gathered their hosts, while the Israelites pitched by the fountain which is in Jezreel (1Sa 29:1). It has been generally supposed that these two positions were over against each other, and that therefore Aphek must be sought in the plain of Esdraelon. No place answering this description has been found here. Fuqu`ah on Mount Gilboa is plainly impossible. If, however, this was only the rallying point of the Philistines from which they went up to Jezreel (1Sa 29:11), it may be identical with the Aphek in the plain of Sharon (compare 1Sa 29:1 above).(4) A city on the plateau east of the Jordan, where disaster befell Benhadad (1Ki 20:26,30). The same place may be intended in 2Ki 13:17. The modern Fiq or Afiq (for both forms are heard) on the brow of the hill beyond Qal`at el-Chucn, east of the Sea of Galilee, probably represents this ancient city.W. Ewing</p>

CONCLUSIONLITERATUREA series of pseudepigraphic works, mainly of Jewish origin, appeared during the period between 210 BC and 200 AD. They have many features in common. The most striking is the resemblance they all bear to the Book of Daniel. Following this model, most of them use &quot;vision&quot; as a literary device by which to introduce their conceptions of the remote future. A side product of this same movement was the composition, mainly in Alexandria, of the Sibylline books. The literary device of &quot;vision&quot; was one used in the Aeneid by Virgil, the classical contemporary of a large number of these works. One peculiarity in regard to the majority of these documents is the fact that while popular among the Christian writers of the first Christian centuries, they disappeared with the advent of the Middle Ages, and remained unknown until the first half of the 19th century was well on in its course.INTRODUCTORYI.

Classification of BooksV. ORIGINAL LANGUAGES OF THE APOCRYPHAVI. DATE OF THE APOCRYPHAL WRITINGSLITERATUREI. Definition.The word Apocrypha, as usually understood, denotes the collection of religious writings which the Septuagint and Vulgate (with trivial differences) contain in addition to the writings constituting the Jewish and Protestant canon. This is not the original or the correct sense of the word, as will be shown, but it is that which it bears almost exclusively in modern speech. In critical works of the present day it is customary to speak of the collection of writings now in view as &quot;the Old Testament Apocrypha,&quot; because many of the books at least were written in Hebrew, the language of the Old Testament, and because all of them are much more closely allied to the Old Testament than to the New Testament. But there is a &quot;New&quot; as well as an &quot;Old&quot; Testament Apocrypha consisting of gospels, epistles, etc. Moreover the adjective &quot;Apocryphal&quot; is also often applied in modern times to what are now generally called &quot;Pseudepigraphical writings,&quot; so designated because ascribed in the titles to authors who did not and could not have written them (eg. Enoch, Abraham, Moses, etc.). The persons thus connected with these books are among the most distinguished in the traditions and history of Israel, and there can be no doubt that the object for which such names have been thus used is to add weight and authority to these writings.The late Professor E. Kautzsch of Halle edited a German translation of the Old and New Testament Apocrypha, and of the Pseudepigraphical writings, with excellent introductions and valuable notes by the best German scholars. Dr. Edgar Hennecke has edited a similar work on the New Testament Apocrypha. Nothing in the English language can be compared with the works edited by Kautzsch and Hennecke in either scholarship or usefulness. (A similar English work to that edited by Kautzsch is now passing through the (Oxford) press, Dr. R. H. Charles being the editor, the writer of this article being one of the contributors.)II.

The Meaning of &quot;Apocryphal.&quot;As applied to early-Christian writings the term &quot;apocryphal&quot; has the secondary and conventional sense of &quot;extra- canonical.&quot;1. Secret:Originally, as the etymology of the word shows (Greek apokrupto = &quot;hide&quot;), it denoted what was &quot;hidden&quot; or &quot;secret.&quot; In this sense &quot;apocryphal&quot; was, to begin with, a title of honor, being applied to writings used by the initiated in esoteric circles and highly valued by them as containing truths miraculously revealed and kept secret from the outside world. Just as there were writings of this kind among the Jews, so there were in Christian circles, among Gnostic sects, apocrypha, which claimed to embody the deeper truths of Christianity, committed as a secret tradition by the risen Christ to His apostles.2. False and Heretical:When the conception of a catholic church began to take shape, it was inevitable that these secret writings should have been regarded with suspicion and have been ultimately forbidden, not only because they fostered the spirit of division in the church, but because they were favorable to the spread of heretical teaching. By a gradual and intelligible transference of ideas &quot;apocryphal,&quot; as applied to secret writings thus discredited by the church, came to have the bad sense of spurious and heretical. In this sense the word is used both by Irenaeus and Tertullian.3. Extra-Canonical:Short of being stigmatized as false and heretical many books were regarded as unsuitable for reading in public worship, although they might be used for purposes of private edification. Chiefly under the influence of Jerome the term &quot;apocryphal&quot; received an extension of meaning so as to include writings of this kind, stress now being laid on their non-acceptance as authoritative Scriptures by the church, without any suggestion that the ground of non- acceptance lay in heretical teaching. It is in this wide sense that the word is used when we speak of &quot;Apocryphal Acts.&quot; Although the Ac which bear this name had their origin for the most part in circles of heretical tendency, the description of them as &quot;apocryphal&quot; involves no judgment as to the character of their contents, but simply denotes that they are Ac which were excluded from the New Testam...</p>

The following epistles fall to be noted as apocryphal:1. Letter Attributed to our Lord:The letter attributed to our Lord is given in Eusebius (Historia Ecclesiastica, I, 13) who records that in his day a copy of the letter was to be found among the archives of Edessa. Abgarus, king of Osroene, which was a small country in Mesopotamia, writes from Edessa, the capital, to our Lord, asking for healing and offering Him protection. Our Lord sends back a short letter saying that He cannot leave Palestine, but that, after His ascension, a messenger will come and heal Abgarus. The letters are obviously spurious. Osroene was actually Christianized about the beginning of the 3rd century, and the legend took shape and received official sanction in order to show that the country had received the Gospel at a much earlier date. See ABGAR.2. Letter Attributed to Peter:The Clementine Homilies is a work of fiction attributed to Clement of Rome; it was actually written about the end of the 2nd century or the beginning of the 3rd. At the beginning of it there is set a letter of Peter to James. In it Peter counsels James not to show the book containing Peter&#x27;s preaching except to a limited circle, and makes a violent attack upon the apostle Paul. It is thus evidently Ebionitic in tendency, and is, like the homilies to which it is prefixed, spurious.3. Letters Attributed to Paul:(1) The Epistle from Laodicea.The mention of such an epistle in Col 4:16 evidently tempted someone to forge a letter. It is written in Latin, and consists of 20 vs; it is a mere cento of Pauline phrases strung together. It is mentioned in the Muratorian Fragment (170 AD); and by the end of the 4th century. it had a wide circulation. It is now almost universally rejected as spurious. See COLOSSIANS; EPHESIANS; LAODICEANS, EPISTLE TO THE.(2) Lost Epistle to the Corinthians.In 1Co 5:9 a letter to the Corinthians is mentioned which appears to have been lost. In a 5th century Armenian version of the Scriptures there is inserted after 2 Corinthians a short letter from the Corinthians to Paul, and one from Paul to the Corinthians. These are also found in Syriac, and were evidently accepted in many quarters as genuine at the end of the 4th century. They formed a part of the Apocryphal Ac of Paul, and date from about 200 AD. See CORINTHIANS.(3) An Epistle to the Alexandrines.This is mentioned only in the Muratorian Fragment, and has not come down to us.(4) Letters of Paul to Seneca.This is a correspondence in Latin, six of the letters being attributed to Paul and eight to Seneca. Regarding this correspondence Lightfoot says: &quot;This correspondence was probably forged in the 4th century, either to recommend Seneca to Christian readers, or to recommend Christianity to students of Seneca.&quot; It had a wide circulation in the Middle Ages.LITERATURE.See article &quot;Apocrypha&quot; in Encyclopedia ...</p>

Apocryphal here means non-canonical. Besides gospels, this literature included acts, epistles and apocalypses.I. Introductory.1. Early Gospels:The introduction to the third canonical Gospel shows that in the days of the writer, when the apostles of the Lord were still living, it was a common practice to write and publish accounts of the acts and words of Jesus. It has even been maintained (S. Baring-Gould, Lost and Hostile Gospels, xxiii, London, 1874) that at the close of the 1st century, almost every church had its own gospel with which alone it was acquainted. These were probably derived, or professed to be derived, from the oral reports of those who had seen, heard, and, it may be, conversed with our Lord. It was dissatisfaction with these compositions that moved Luke to write his Gospel. Whether any of these ante-Lukan documents are among those still known to us is hardly longer doubtful. Scholars of repute--Grotius, Grabe, Mill--were in earlier times disposed to place the Gospel of the Hebrews, the Gospel of the Ebionites, and the Gospel of the Egyptians among those alluded to by Luke, some holding the Gospel of the Hebrews to be as early as just after the middle of the 1st century. More recent criticism does not allow so early an appearance for those gospels, though a fairly early date is still postulated for the Gospel of the Hebrews. The Protevangelium of James (noticed below) is still held by some as possibly falling within the 1st century (EB, I, 259).2. Canonical Gospels:However this may be, there can be no doubt that by the close of the 1st century and the early part of the 2nd century, opinion was practically unanimous in recognition of the authority of the four Gospels of the canonical Scriptures. Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons (180 AD), recognizes four, and only four Gospels, as &quot;pillars&quot; of the church. The Harmonies of Theophilus, bishop of Antioch (168-80 AD), and of Tatian, and the Apology of Justin Martyr carry back the tradition to a much earlier period of the century, and, as Liddon proves at considerable length (Bampton Lectures, 2nd...</p>

It was situated a little to the south of Lake Bolbe, on the Via Egnatia, the great Roman road leading from the coast of the Adriatic to the river Hebrus (Maritza), one of the main military and commercial highways of the empire: it lay between Amphipolis and Thessalonica, a day&#x27;s journey (Livy xlv.28) or about 30 Roman miles from the former and 38 from the latter. The foundation of the town may perhaps be attributed to about 432 BC; in any case, coins are extant which attest its existence in the 4th century BC (Head, Historia Numorum, 181). Paul and Silas passed through the town on their journey from Philippi to Thessalonica, but do not appear to have stayed there (Ac 17:1). The name seems to have survived in the modern Pollina (Leake, Northern Greece, III, 458; Cousinery, Voyage dans la Macedoine, I, 115).Marcus N. Tod</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ap-o-lo&#x27;-ni-us (Apollonios): A common name among the Syro-Macedonians. Prideaux (Connexion) interrupts his narrative of the year 148 BC to give an account of the different persons who bore this name(1) Son of Thrasaeus (2 Macc 3:5) who was governor of Coele-Syria (Palestine and Phoenicia) under Seleucus Philopator, when Heliodorus came to Jerusalem to rob the temple, and afterward, by his authority in that province, supported Simon the governor of the temple at Jerusalem against Onias the high priest. He was also chief minister of state to King Seleucus. But on the accession of Antiochus Epiphanes, Apollonius, in some way becoming obnoxious to the new king, left Syria and retired to Miletus.(2) A son of (1) who, while his father resided at Miletus, was brought up at Rome along with Demetrius, son of Seleucus Philopator, and at that time held as a hostage by the Romans. This Apollonius lived in great intimacy with Demetrius, who, on recovering the crown of Syria, made him governor of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, the same government which his father held under Seleucus Philopator. He seems to have been continued in the same government by Alexander (1 Macc 10:69) but he revolted from him to embrace the interest of Demetrius.(3) Son of Menestheus, and favorite and chief minister of Antiochus Epiphanes (2 Macc 4:21). He went as ambassador from Antiochus, first to Rome (Livy xlii.6) and afterward to Ptolemy Philometor, king of Egypt (2 Macc 4:21). This is generally held to be the same who is said to have been over the tribute (1 Macc 1:29; 2 Macc 5:24) and who, on the return of Antiochus from his last expedition into Egypt, was sent with a detachment of 22,000 men to destroy Jerusalem. He attacked the Jews while keeping the Sabbath day holy and slew great multitudes of them (2 Macc 5:24-27).(4) Governor of Samaria in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes. He was slain in battle by Judas Maccabeus (1 Macc 3:10,11; Ant, XII, vii, 10). (5) Son of Gennaeus (2 Macc 12:2); as governor of a toparchy in Palestine under Antiochus Eupator he proved a bitter enemy of the Jews.J. Hutchison</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-pol&#x27;-os (Apollos, the short form of Apollonius): Apollos was a Jew of Alexandrian race (Ac 18:24) who reached Ephesus in the summer of 54 AD, while Paul was on his third missionary journey, and there he &quot;spake and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus&quot; (Ac 18:25). That he was eminently fitted for the task is indicated by the fact of his being a &quot;learned man,&quot; &quot;mighty in the scriptures,&quot; &quot;fervent in spirit,&quot; &quot;instructed in the way of the Lord&quot; (Ac 18:24,25). His teaching was however incomplete in that he knew &quot;only the baptism of John&quot; (Ac 18:25), and this has given rise to some controversy. According to Blass, his information was derived from a written gospel which reached Alexandria, but it was more probably the fruits of what Apollos had heard, either directly or from others, of the preaching of John the Baptist at Bethany beyond Jordan (compare Joh 1:28). Upon receiving further instruction from Priscilla and Aquila (Ac 18:26), Apollos extended his mission to Achaia, being encouraged thereto by the brethren of Ephesus (Ac 18:27).In Achaia &quot;he helped them much that had believed through grace; for he powerfully confuted the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ&quot; (Ac 18:27,28). During Apollos&#x27; absences in Achaia, Paul had reached Ephesus and learned of what had been taught by Apollos there. (Ac 19:1). Since Paul was informed that the Ephesians still knew nothing of the baptism of the Spirit (Ac 19:2-4), it is probable that Apollos had not imparted to his hearers the further instruction he had received from Priscilla and Aquila, but had departed for Achaia shortly after receiving it. Paul remained upward of two years among the Ephesians (Ac 19:8,10), and in the spring of 57 AD he wrote the First Epistle to the Corinthians. By this time Apollos was once more in Ephesus (compare 1Co 16:12). It is incredible that this epistle of Paul could have been prompted by any feelings of jealousy or animosity on his part against Apollos. It was rather the outcome of discussion between the two regarding the critical situation then existing in Corinth.The mission of Apollos had met with a certain success, but the breeding of faction, which that very success, through the slight discrepancies in his teaching (compare 1Co 1:12; 3:4) with that of Paul or of Cephas, had engendered, was utterly alien to his intentions. The party spirit was as distasteful to Apollos as it was to Paul, and made him reluctant to return to the scene of his former labors even at the desire of Paul himself (1Co 16:12). The epistle voiced the indignation of both. Paul welcomed the cooperation of Apollos (1Co 3:6: &quot;I planted, Apollos watered&quot;). It was not against his fellow-evangelist that he fulminated, but against the petty spirit of those who loved faction more than truth, who saw not that both he and Apollos came among them as &quot;God&#x27;s fellow-workers&quot; (1Co 3:9), the common servants of the one Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.This view is also born...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-pol&#x27;-i-on (Apolluon; &#x27;abhaddon, &quot;destroyer&quot;): Present participle of the verb apolluo, &quot;to destroy.&quot;I. Definition.A proper name, original with the author of the Apocalypse and used by him once (Re 9:11) as a translation of the Hebrew word &quot;Abaddon&quot; (see ABADDON) to designate an angel or prince of the lower world.II. Old Testament Background.1. Fundamental Meaning:The term Abaddon (&quot;destruction&quot;) appears solely in the Wisdom literature of the Old Testament and in the following narrow range of instances: Job 26:6; 28:22; 31:12; Ps 88:11; Pr 15:11. In all these passages save one (Job 31:12) the word is combined either with Sheol, &quot;death,&quot; or &quot;the grave,&quot; in such a way as to indicate a purely eschatological term based upon the advanced idea of moral distinctions in the realm of the dead. In the one exceptional passage (Es 8:6 is incorrectly referred to--the word here is different, namely, &#x27;abhedhan) where the combination does not occur, the emphasis upon the moral element in the &quot;destruction&quot; mentioned is so definite as practically to preclude the possibility of interpreting the term in any general sense (as Charles, HDB, article &quot;Abaddon&quot;; per con., Briggs, ICC, &quot;Psalms&quot; in the place cited.; BDB, sub loc.). The meaning of the word, therefore, is: the place or condition of utter ruin reserved for the wicked in the realm of the dead.2. Personification:One other feature of Old Testament usage is worthy of consideration as throwing light upon Re 9:11. Abaddon and the accompanying terms &quot;Death&quot; and Sheol are personified (as in Job 28:22) and represented as living beings who speak and act (compare Re 6:8).III. New Testament Usage.1. The Starting-Point:The starting-point of the Apocalyptist&#x27;s use of &quot;Apollyon&quot; is to be found in the fundamental meaning of &quot;Abaddon&quot; as moral destruction in the underworld, together with the occasional personification of kindred terms in the Old Testament. The imagery was in general terms familiar while the New Testament writer felt perfectly free to vary the usage to suit his own particular purposes.2. Apollyon not Satan but Part of an Ideal Description:(1) Since Apollyon is a personification he is not to be identified with Satan (compare Re 9:1 where Satan seems to be clearly indicated) or with any other being to whom historical existence and definite characteristics are ascribed. He is the central figure in an ideal picture of evil forces represented as originating in the world of lost spirits and allowed to operate destructively in human life. They are pictured as locusts, but on an enlarged scale and with the addition of many features inconsistent with the strict application of the figure (see Re 9:7-10). The intention is, by the multiplication of images which the author does not attempt to harmonize, to convey the impression of great power and far-reaching destructiveness.(2) This interpretation finds additional support in the writer&#x27;s significant departure from the familiar usage. In the Old Testament the place of dest...</p>

Not found in the English Versions of the Bible, but used twice in the New Testament, in the Greek original, to express abandonment of the faith. Paul was falsely accused of teaching the Jews apostasy from Moses (Ac 21:21); he predicted the great apostasy from Christianity, foretold by Jesus (Mt 24:10-12) which would precede &quot;the day of the Lord&quot; (2Th 2:2). Apostasy, not in name but in fact, meets scathing rebuke in the Epistle of Jude, e.g. the apostasy of angels (Jude 1:6). Foretold, with warnings, as sure to abound in the latter days (1Ti 4:1-3; 2Th 2:3; 2Pe 3:17). Causes of: persecution (Mt 24:9,10); false teachers (Mt 24:11); temptation (Lu 8:13); worldliness (2Ti 4:4); defective knowledge of Christ (1 Joh 2:19); moral lapse (Heb 6:4-6); forsaking worship and spiritual living (Heb 10:25-31); unbelief (Heb 3:12). Biblical examples: Saul (1Sa 15:11); Amaziah (2Ch 25:14,27); many disciples (Joh 6:66); Hymeneus and Alexander (1Ti 1:19,20); Demas (2Ti 4:10). For further illustration see De 13:13; Ze 1:4-6; Ga 5:4; 2Pe 2:20,21.&quot;Forsaking Yahweh&quot; was the characteristic and oft-recurring sin of the chosen people, especially in their contact with idolatrous nations. It constituted their supreme national peril. The tendency appeared in their earliest history, as abundantly seen in the warnings and prohibitions of the laws of Moses (Ex 20:3,4,23; De 6:14; 11:16). The fearful consequences of religious and moral apostasy appear in the curses pronounced against this sin, on Mount Ebal, by the representatives of six of the tribes of Israel, elected by Moses (De 27:13-26; 28:15-68). So wayward was the heart of Israel, even in the years immediately following the national emancipation, in the wilderness, that Joshua found it necessary to re-pledge the entire nation to a new fidelity to Yahweh and to their original covenant before they were permitted to enter the Promised Land (Jos 24:1-28). Infidelity to this covenant blighted the nation&#x27;s prospects and growth during the time of the Judges (Jud 2:11-15; 10:6,10,13; 1Sa 12:10). It was the cause of prolific and ever-increasing evil, civic and moral, from Solomon&#x27;s day to the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities. Many of the kings of the divided kingdom apostatized, leading the people, as in the case of Rehoboam, into the grossest forms of idolatry and immorality (1Ki 14:22-24; 2Ch 12:1). Conspicuous examples of such royal apostasy are Jeroboam (1Ki 12:28-32); Ahab (1Ki 16:30-33); Ahaziah (1Ki 22:51-53); Jehoram (2Ch 21:6,10,12-15); Ahaz (2Ch 28:1-4); Manasseh (2Ch 33:1-9); Amen (2Ch 33:22). See IDOLATRY.Prophecy originated as a Divine and imperative protest against this historic tendency to defection from the religion of Yahweh. In classical Greek, apostasy signified revolt from a military commander. In the roman catholic church it denotes abandonment of religious orders; renunciation of ecclesiastical...</p>

In earlier classical Greek there was a distinction between an aggelos or messenger and an apostolos, who was not a mere messenger, but a delegate or representative of the person who sent him. In the later Judaism, again, apostoloi were envoys sent out by the patriarchate in Jerusalem to collect the sacred tribute from the Jews of the Dispersion. It seems unlikely, however, that either of these uses bears upon the Christian origin of a term which, in any case, came to have its own distinctive Christian meaning. To understand the word as we find it in the New Testament it is not necessary to go beyond the New Testament itself. To discover the source of its Christian use it is sufficient to refer to its immediate and natural signification. The term used by Jesus, it must be remembered, would be Aramaic, not Greek, and apostolos would be its literal equivalent.1. The Twelve:In the New Testament history we first hear of the term as applied by Jesus to the Twelve in connection with that evangelical mission among the villages on which He dispatched them at an early stage of His public ministry (Mt 10:1 ff; Mr 3:14; 6:30; Lu 6:13; 9:1 ff). From a comparison of the Synoptics it would seem that the name as thus used was not a general designation for the Twelve, but had reference only to this particular mission, which was typical and prophetic, however, of the wider mission that was to come (compare Hort, Christian Ecclesia, 23-29). Luke, it is true, uses the word as a title for the Twelve apart from reference to the mission among the villages. But the explanation probably is, as Dr. Hort suggests, that since the Third Gospel and the Book of Ac formed two sections of what was really one work, the author in the Gospel employs the term in that wider sense which it came to have after the Ascension.When we pass to Acts, &quot;apostles&quot; has become an ordinary name for the Eleven (Ac 1:2,26), and after the election of Matthias in place of Judas, for the Twelve (2:37,42,43, etc.). But even so it does not denote a particular and restricted office, but rather that function of a world-wide missionary service to which the Twelve were especially called. In His last charge, just before He ascended, Jesus had commissioned them to go forth into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature (Mt 28:19,20; Mr 16:15). He had said that they were to be His witnesses not only in Jerusalem and Judea, but in Samaria (contrast Mt 10:5), and unto the uttermost part of the earth (Ac 1:8). They were apostles, therefore, qua missionaries--not merely because they were the Twelve, but because they were now sent forth by their Lord on a universal mission for the propagation of the gospel.2. Paul:The very fact that the name &quot;apostle&quot; means what it does would point to the impossibility...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">kred.The Oldest Creed:The Apostles&#x27; Creed is the oldest creed, and lies at the basis of most others. Though not, as the long-current legend of its origin affirmed, the direct work of the Apostles, it has its roots in apostolic times, and embodies, with much fidelity, apostolic teaching. It will be seen immediately that it had an important place in the early church, when as yet no creed but itself existed. The oldest usage of the term &quot;Rule of Faith&quot; (regula fidei), now commonly given to the Scriptures, has reference to this creed. It was the creed that could be appealed to as held by the church in all its great branches, and so as forming the test of catholicity. It was as resting on this creed that the church could be called &quot;catholic and apostolic.&quot; Of late the creed has been the subject of great controversy, and violent attempts have been made to thrust out some of its chief articles from the Christian faith. This is a special reason for considering the foundations on which these articles of faith rest.I. Form of the Creed.In the first place, what is the creed? Here, first of all, it is to be pointed out that the received form of the creed is not its oldest or original form. The creed exists in two forms--a shorter and a longer; the former, known as the Old Roman Form, going back certainly as early as the middle of the 2nd century (about 140 AD), the latter, the enlarged form, in its present shape, of much later date. Its final form was probably given to it in South Gaul not before the middle of the 5th century (in one or two clauses, as late as the 7th). It is desirable, at the outset, to put these two forms of the creed (in translation) clearly before the reader.1. Old Roman Form:First, the Old Roman Form is given from the Greek of Marcellus, of Ancyra, 341 AD. It runs thus: &quot;I believe in God the Father Almighty. And in Jesus Christ His only (begotten) Son our Lord, who was born of the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary; crucified under Pontius Pilate, and buried; the third day He rose from the dead; He ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father, from thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead. And in the Holy Ghost; the holy Church; the forgiveness of sins; the resurrection of the body; (the life everlasting).&quot;The last clause is omitted in the Latin form preserved by Rufinus, 390 AD.2. The Received Form:The Received Form of the creed reads thus: &quot;I believe in God the Father Almighty; Maker of Heaven and Earth; and in Jesus Christ His only (begotten) Son our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; He descended into hell; the third day He rose from the dead; He ascended into heaven; and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

The Mission:(1) When the disciples realized that they had seen the risen Christ for the last time and that it had now become their duty to spread His message, they gathered themselves together and restored the number of &quot;witnesses&quot; to the appointed Twelve. Immediately afterward the outpouring of the Holy Spirit gave them the signal to begin work. At first this work was rigidly centered in Jerusalem, and the first journeyings were the result of forcible dispersion and not of planned effort (Ac 11:19). But pilgrims to the feasts had carried away the gospel with them, and in this way Christianity had been spread at least as far as Damascus (Ac 9:2,19). The dispersion itself widened the circle to Cyprus and to Antioch and marked the beginning of the Gentilework (Ac 11:19-20). Here the extreme prominence of Paul&#x27;s ministry in the New Testament should not obscure the success of the other missionaries.When the apostles began their journeys we do not know but at the time of Ga 1:19 only Peter represented the Twelve in Jerusalem. Paul mentions their extended work in 1Co 9:5,6 and it seems certain that Peter was in Rome shortly before his death. The troubles caused Paul by the Judaizers at least give evidence of the missionary zeal of the latter. Barnabas and Mark worked after their separation from Paul (Ac 15:39) and GentileChristianity existed in Rome long before the latter&#x27;s arrival there (Ro 1:13). By the year 100 it appears that Christianity extended around the Mediterranean from Alexandria to Rome (and doubtless farther, although data are scanty), while Asia Minor was especially pervaded by it.(2) Many factors cooperated to help the work: Peace was universal and communication was easy. Greek was spoken everywhere. The protection given Judaism sheltered from civil interference. The presence of Judaism insured hospitality and hearers for at least the first efforts to convert. The Jews&#x27; own proselytizing zeal (Mt 23:15) had prepared Gentiles to receive Christianity. And not the least element was the break-up of the old religions and the general looking to the East for religious satisfaction.(3) For the methods, Paul&#x27;s procedure is probably typical. Avoiding the smaller places, he devoted himself to the cities as the strategic points and traveled in a direct route, without side-journeys. In this way a &quot;line of fire&quot; (Harnack) was traced, and the flame could be trusted to spread of its own accord to each side of the road. So as fruits of Paul&#x27;s work at Ephesus there appear churches at Colosse and Laodicea some hundred and twenty miles away (Col 2:1; 4:16). The churches founded needed revisiting and confirming, but when the apostle felt that they could shift for themselves, he felt also that his work in the East was over (Ro 15:23).2. Jerusalem Church:The members of the earliest Jerusalem church thought of themselves simply as Jews who had a true understanding of the Messiah and so constituting a new &quot;way&quot; or &quot;party&quot; (hardly &quot;sect&quot;) in ...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">In the institution of judges by Moses (Ex 18:26), the reference: &quot;The hard cases they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves,&quot; indicates simply a distribution of cases between two courts, but gives no trace of any provision for the rehearing of any case, by a higher court, that has already been decided by a lower. In De 17:8-13, directions are given that a lower court, under certain conditions, shall ask a higher for instructions as to procedure, and shall strictly follow the order prescribed: nevertheless, the decision itself belongs to the lower court. When its sentence was once given, there was no appeal.In the New Testament, the provision of the Roman law, for an appeal from a lower to a higher court, is clearly recognized, although the case of Paul in Ac 25 does not strictly fall within its scope. The Roman law originally gave a citizen the right of appeal to the tribune of the people, but, with the establishment of the Empire, the emperor himself assumed this function of the tribune, and became the court of last resort. The case of Paul, however, had not been tried before Festus, nor any verdict rendered, when (Ac 25:10,11) he utters the proper legal formula: &quot;I appeal unto Caesar&quot; (Kaisara epikaloumai). That Roman citizens could insist upon such procedure, as right, is not perfectly certain (HJP, II, 2 279). Paul evidently acted upon the suggestion of the governor himself (Ac 25:9), who seems to have been desirous of avoiding the responsibility of a case involving questions most remote from his ordinary attention. At first sight, Paul&#x27;s decision to appeal seems premature. He throws away his chance of acquittal by Festus, and acts upon the assumption that he has been already condemned. Ac 26:32 shows that the possibility of his acquittal had amounted almost to a certainty. His course is explicable only by regarding his appeal the master stroke of a great leader, who was ready to take risks. In the proposition of Festus, he grasps at what had been an object of hope long deferred.For many years, he had been desiring and praying to get to Rome (Ac 19:21; Ro 1:11,15; 15:23,24). The Lord had just assured him (Ac 23:11), that as he had testified at Jerusalem, &quot;so must thou bear witness also at Rome.&quot; With this promise and direction in view, he hastens toward the world&#x27;s capital and the center of the world&#x27;s influence, in the seemingly precipitate words, &quot;I appeal,&quot; which a lower order of prudence would have deferred until he had first been condemned.H.

Nephesh then comes to mean the seat of the senses, affections, emotions, and to it is ascribed love, joy, desire (compare De 12:20; Pr 6:30 the Revised Version, margin; Mic 7:1, where the nephesh &quot;desires&quot;). The idea of desire or appetite of the nephesh may include all forms of longing; e.g. lust (Jer 2:24; &quot;her desire&quot; is literally &quot;the desire of her nephesh&quot;), the appetite for revenge (Ps 41:2, &quot;the will of his enemies&quot; is literally &quot;the nephesh,&quot; etc.). The next step is to identify the nephesh with its desire, hence in the cases above nephesh is translated &quot;appetite.&quot; In the 4th case (Isa 29:8) &quot;His soul hath appetite&quot; is a free translation of naphsho shoqeqah, literally &quot;His soul runneth to and fro.&quot;S.

Hist., iii.64; xiv.61; CIL, X, 6824, or Market of Appius, was a town situated at the forty-third milestone on the Appian Road (39 1/2 English miles from Rome, a single day&#x27;s journey for energetic travelers) according to the imperial itineraries (Ant., 108; Hierosol. 611; Geog. Rav. 4.34). Its existence probably dates from the time of Appius Claudius Caecus (Suet. Tib. 2; compare Mommsen, Rom. Forsch., I, 308), who laid out the famous highway from Rome to Capua in 312 BC. In the 1st century it had the rank of a municipality (Pliny, iii.64). Its importance as a highway station is due chiefly to the canal which ran by the side of the road from there to within a short distance of Tarracina (at the sixty-second milestone), affording an alternative means of conveyance (Strabo v.3.6). It was customary to cover this section of the journey, passing through the Pontine Marshes, by night in canal boats drawn by mules. Horace (Sat. i.5) offers a lively picture of the discomforts of the trip, mentioning the importunate inn-keepers and intolerable drinking water at Appii Forum, the gnats and frogs which were enemies to repose, and the exasperating procrastination of the muleteer.The Christian brethren in Rome went out along the Appian Road to welcome the apostle Paul upon hearing of his arrival at Puteoli. One party awaited him at Three Taverns while another proceeded as far as Appii Forum Ac 28:15).George H. Allen</p>

Its great value and careful protection by the eyelids automatically closing when there is the least possibility of danger made it the emblem of that which was most precious and jealously protected. The Hebrew terms for it were, &#x27;ishon, diminutive of &#x27;ish, &quot;man,&quot; little man or mannikin, referring perhaps specially to the pupil, probably from &quot;the little image one sees of himself when looking into another&#x27;s pupil&quot; (Davies&#x27; Lexicon). &quot;He kept him (Israel) as the apple of his eye&quot; (De 32:10); &quot;Keep me as the apple of the eye,&quot; literally, &quot;as the apple, the daughter of the eye&quot; (Ps 17:8). &quot;Keep my law (the Revised Version, margin &quot;teaching&quot;) as the apple of thine eye&quot; (Pr 7:2). Compare Pr 7:9 where it is used to denote what is the center (American Revised Version, &quot;in the middle of the night&quot;; the English Revised Version &quot;in, the blackness of night&quot;; margin &quot;Hebrew pupil (of the eye)&quot;); babhah perhaps an &quot;opening,&quot; &quot;gate&quot;; others regard it as a mimetic word akin to Latin pupa, papilla (&quot;He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye,&quot; i.e. Yahweh&#x27;s; Zec 2:8); bath-`ayin, &quot;daughter of the eye&quot;; &quot;Give thyself no respite, let not the apple of thine eye cease&quot; (La 2:18), which means, either &quot;sleep not,&quot; or &quot;cease not to weep.&quot; kore, &quot;young girl,&quot; &quot;pupil of the eye&quot;: &quot;He (the Lord) will keep the good deeds (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;bounty&quot;) of a man as the apple of the eye&quot; (Ecclesiasticus 17:22); the Septuagint also has kore in all instances except La 2:18, where it has thugater, &quot;daughter.&quot;W.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ap&#x27;-l ap&#x27;-l tre, (tappuach): A fruit tree and fruit mentioned chiefly in Cant, concerning the true nature of which there has been much dispute.So 2:3 says: &quot;As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight&quot;; So 8:5: &quot;Under the apple-tree I awakened thee: there thy mother was in travail with thee, there was she in travail that brought thee forth.&quot; Of the fruit it is said, So 2:3: &quot;His fruit was sweet to my taste&quot;; So 2:5: &quot;Stay ye me with raisins, refresh me with apples&quot;; So 7:8: &quot;the smell of thy breath (Hebrew &quot;nose&quot;) like apples.&quot;In all the above references the true apple, Pyrus malus, suits the conditions satisfactorily. The apple tree affords good shade, the fruit is sweet, the perfume is a very special favorite with the people of the East. Sick persons in Palestine delight to hold an apple in their hands, simply for the smell. (Compare Arabian Nights, &quot;Prince Hassan and the Paribanou.&quot;) Further the Arabic for apple tuffah is without doubt identical with the Hebrew tappuach. The apple was well known, too, in ancient times; it was, for example, extensively cultivated by the Romans.The one serious objection is that apples do not easily reach perfection in Palestine; the climate is too dry and hot; farther north in the Lebanon they flourish. At the same time it is possible to exaggerate this objection, for with careful grafting and cultivation exceedingly good apples may be produced in the mountain regions. Apple trees there need special care and renewal of the grafts, but there is no impossibility that at the time of the writing of Canticles skilled gardeners should have been able to produce sweet and perfumed apples in Palestine. Small but very sweet and fragrant apples are now grown at Gaza. Good apples are now plentiful in the market at Jerusalem, but they are chiefly importations from the North.On account of the above difficulty three other fruits have been suggested by various writers. Two doubtless have been brought forward with a view to Pr 25:11: &quot;A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in network of silver,&quot; but the reference would certainly seem to be to some silver filigree work ornamented with gold modeled to look like fruit rather than to any actual fruit. The citron and the apricot (Tristram) have both been suggested as the true tappuach. The former, which is a native of Persia, does not appear to have been introduced into Palestine until well into the Christian era and the apricot, though an attractive substitute for the apple and today one of the most beautiful and productive of fruit trees, can hardly have been established in Palestine at the time of the scriptural references. It is a native of China and is said to have first begun to find its way westward at the time of Alexander the Great.The third of the fruits is the quince, Cydonia vulgaris (Natural Order Rosaceae), and this had more serious claims. It flourishes in Palestine and has been long...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">sod&#x27;-um: Josephus (BJ, IV, viii, 4) says that &quot;the traces (or shadows) of the five cities (of the plain) are still to be seen, as well as the ashes growing in their fruits, which fruits have a color as if they were fit to be eaten; but if you pluck them with your hands they dissolve into smoke and ashes.&quot; What this &quot;Dead Sea fruit&quot; is, is uncertain. The name &quot;Dead Sea apples&quot; is often given to the fruit of the Solanum Sodomaean &quot;a prickly shrub with fruit not unlike a small yellow tomato.&quot; Cheyne thinks that the fruits referred to by Josephus (compare Tacitus Hist. v.37) may be either(1) those of the `osher tree (`usar, Calotropis procera, described by Hasselquist (Travels, 1766)), found in abundance about Jericho and near the Dead Sea, which are filled with dust when they have been attacked by an insect, leaving the skin only entire, and of a beautiful color. Tristram describes the fruit as being &quot;as large as an apple of average size, of a bright yellow color, hanging three or four together close to the stem&quot;; or as suggested by Tristram(2) those of the wild colocynth; the fruit is fair of aspect with a pulp which dries up into a bitter powder (EB, article &quot;Sodom,&quot; col. 4669, note 2). This colocynth is supposed to be the &quot;wild vine&quot; mentioned 2Ki 4:39. The &quot;vine of Sodom&quot; of De 32:32 has been supposed to bear the &quot;Dead Sea fruit&quot;; but most modern writers regard the passage as figurative.W. L. Walker</p>

Its Biblical and archaic use conveys a much stronger meaning and is equivalent to its use in legal formalities of today, &quot;to approve a bill,&quot; i.e. by some act, generally a signature, to express approval. In New Testament, a number of times, for Greek dokimazo, &quot;to test, try, make proof of,&quot; and its derivative, dokimos, &quot;tested,&quot; &quot;tried.&quot; The word will, in almost every ease, imply that the proof is victoriously demonstrated, the proved is also approved, just as in English we speak of &quot;tried men&quot; (Trench, Greek Synonyms of New Testament). It is the word most frequently used for the testing of ores.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ak&#x27;-wi-la (Akulas), (&quot;an eagle&quot;): Aquila and his wife Priscilla, the diminutive form of Prisca, are introduced into the narrative of the Ac by their relation to Paul. He meets them first in Corinth (Ac 18:2). Aquila was a native of Pontus, doubtless one of the colony of Jews mentioned in Ac 2:9; 1Pe 1:1. They were refugees from the cruel and unjust edict of Claudius which expelled all Jews from Rome in 52 AD. The decree, it is said by Suetonius, was issued on account of tumults raised by the Jews, and he especially mentions one Chrestus (Suetonius Claud. 25). Since the word Christus could easily be confounded by him to refer to some individual whose name was Chrestus and who was an agitator, resulting in these disorders, it has been concluded that the fanatical Jews were then persecuting their Christian brethren and disturbances resulted. The cause of the trouble did not concern Claudius, and so without making inquiry, all Jews were expelled. The conjecture that Aquila was a freedman and that his master had been Aquila Pontius, the Roman senator, and that from him he received his name is without foundation.He doubtless had a Hebrew name, but it is not known. It was a common custom for Jews outside of Palestine to take Roman names, and it is just that this man does, and it is by that name we know him. Driven from Rome, Aquila sought refuge in Corinth, where Paul, on his second missionary journey, meets him because they have the same trade: that of making tents of Cilician cloth (Ac 18:3). The account given of him does not justify the conclusion that he and his wife were already Christians when Paul met them. Had that been the case Lu would almost certainly have said so, especially if it was true that Paul sought them out on that account. Judging from their well-known activity in Christian work they would have gathered a little band of inquirers or possibly converts, even though they had been there for but a short time. It is more in harmony with the account to conclude that Paul met them as fellow-tradespeople, and that he took the opportunity of preaching Christ to them as they toiled.There can be no doubt that Paul would use these days to lead them into the kingdom and instruct them therein, so that afterward they would be capable of being teachers themselves (Ac 18:26). Not only did they become Christians, but they also became fast and devoted friends of Paul, and he fully reciprocated their affection for him (Ro 16:3,4). They accompanied him when he left Corinth to go to Ephesus and remained there while he went on his journey into Syria. When he ,wrote the first letter to the church at Corinth they were still at Ephesus, and their house there was used as a Christian assembly-place (1Co 16:19). The decree of Claudius excluded the Jews from Rome only temporarily, and so afterward Paul is found there, and his need of friends and their affection for him doubtless led them also to go to that city (Ro 16:3).

This is probably the place called the City of Moab in Nu 22:36, where the Hebrew is `ir mo&#x27;abh. It is probably also intended by &quot;the city that is in the middle of the valley&quot; (De 2:36; Jos 13:9,16; 2Sa 24:5). It lay &quot;on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border&quot; (Nu 22:36). A possible identification might be the ruin noted by Burckhardt, in the floor of the valley, on a piece of pasture-land below the confluence of the Lejjun and the Mojib. Buhl however thinks that not a city but a Moabite district somewhere in the region south of the Arnon may be intended (GAP, 269).W. Ewing</p>

In the King James Version it is transliterated only once (Jos 18:18) describing the border of Benjamin. Elsewhere it is rendered &quot;plain.&quot; But in the Revised Version (British and American) it is everywhere transliterated. South of the Dead Sea the name is still retained in Wady el-Arabah. In De 1:1; 2:8 (the King James Version &quot;plain&quot;) the southern portion is referred to; in De 3:17; 4:49; Jos 3:16; 11:2; 12:3 and 2Ki 14:25 the name is closely connected with the Dead Sea and the Sea of Chinnereth (Gennesaret). The allusions to the Arabah in De 11:30; Jos 8:14; 12:1; 18:18; 2Sa 2:29; 4:7; 2Ki 25:4; Jer 39:4; 52:7 indicate that the word was generally used in its most extended sense, while in Jos 11:16, and 12:8 it is represented as one of the great natural divisions of the country.The southern portion, which still retains the name of Arabah, is included in the wilderness of Zin (Nu 34:3). According to the survey of Lord Kitchener and George Armstrong made in 1883, under the auspices of the Palestine Exploration Fund, its length from the head of the Gulf of Akabah to the Dead Sea is 112 miles. The lowest point of the watershed is 45 miles from Akabah, and 660 feet above tide (1,952 above the Dead Sea). The average width of the valley up to this point is about 6 miles, but here a series of low limestone ridges (called Er Risheh) rising 150 feet above the plain runs obliquely across it for a distance of 10 miles, narrowing it up to a breadth of about one-half mile. North of this point, opposite Mount Hor, the valley widens out to 13 miles and then gradually narrows to 6 miles at the south end of the Dead Sea. At Ain Abu Werideh, 29 miles north of the watershed, the valley is at the sea-level--1,292 feet above that of the Dead Sea. North of the watershed, the main line of drainage is the Wady el-Jeib, which everywhere keeps pretty close to the west side of the valley.At Ain Abu Werideh it is joined by numerous wadies descending from the Edomite mountains on the east, which altogether water an oasis of considerable extent, covered with a thicket of young palms, tamarisks, willows and reeds. Twenty-four miles farther north the Arabah breaks down suddenly into the valley of the Dead Sea, or the Ghor, as it is technically called. Lord Kitchener&#x27;s report is here so vivid as to be worthy of literal reproduction. &quot;The descent to the Ghor was down a sandy slope of 300 feet, and the change of climate was most marked, from the sandy desert to masses of tangled vegetation with streams of water running in all directions, birds fluttering from every tree, the whole country alive with life; nowhere have I seen so great and sudden a contrast&quot; (Mount Seir, 214).

Name:The Hebrew word `arabh always denotes, strictly speaking, not the country, but the people of Arabia taken collectively, and especially the nomadic Arabs. The name of the country does not occur in the Old Testament, but in the New Testament it is used to denote the Syrian desert or the peninsula of Sinai.2. Situation and Configuration:Surrounded as it is on three sides by the sea--by the Indian Ocean on the south, and its two branches, the Red Sea on the west and the Persian Gulf on the east--and on the fourth side by the desert of Syria, the country of Arabia is to all intents and purposes an island; and it is named by its inhabitants and by those who speak their language &quot;the Island of the Arabs.&quot; In configuration the country is roughly of the form of a parallelogram, about 1,000 miles in length by 500 or 600 miles broad. This parallelogram is not of uniform altitude, but the generally even surface is tilted to one corner in such a way that the most southerly point contains mountains rising to 10,000 feet in height, whilst the Northeast corner is almost on a level with the sea. The altitudes of the intervening portions are in proportion to their situation with respect to these extremes. Thus the mountains of the Southeast corner have an altitude of from 5,000 to 6,000 feet, those of the Northwest of 4,000 or 5,000, whereas those which are situated near the middle of the West coast rise to 8,000 feet, and the plateau which forms the northern half of the interior of the peninsula is between 3,000 and 4,000 feet above sea-level. In consequence of this configuration the main watershed of the country runs parallel to the West coast at a distance of between 50 and 100 miles from the sea, with a subsidiary watershed running along the south; and the principal outlets for the drainage run in a Northeast direction. The whole of Arabia stretches from about 13 degrees to about 36 degrees north of the equator, and it lies between 33 degrees and 60 degrees east of Greenwich. Its area is about eight times that of the British Isles, or nearly 1,000,000 square miles.II. Physical Features.1. The Desert:Although Arabia is considered by geographers as part of the continent of Asia, it belongs in almost every respect to Africa. The great bulk of the country is desert, of fine sand in the southern part, but consisting of coarse sand (the nefud), gravel and fl...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ar&#x27;-a-bik lan&#x27;-gwaj: For the student of the Bible the Arabic language is of interest, first, as one of the members of the Semitic group of languages, to which belong the Hebrew and Aramaic tongues of the Bible; secondly, as one of the languages into which the Bible and other church literature were early translated and in which a Christian literature was produced; and thirdly, as the vernacular of Mohammed and his followers, the classical tongue of that religious system which is the offspring of a degenerate Judaism and Christianity.1. Philological Characterization:Scholars are generally agreed in grouping the Arabic and Ethiopic together as a South-Sem branch of the Semitic stock. For the geographical and ethnological background of the Arabic language, see ARABIA. A general characteristic of this tongue of the desert is its remarkable retention into a late historical period, of grammatical features obliterated or in process of obliteration in the other Semitic tongues at their earliest emergence in literature; so that in the period since the golden age of its literature, the Arabic has been undergoing changes in some respects analogous to those which its sister-dialects underwent in their pre-literary or earliest literary stage. Thus, for example, the case-endings of nouns, lost in Aramaic and Canaanitish (including Hebrew), all but lost in the Abyssinian dialects, beginning to be disregarded in even the early (popular) Babylonian, lost also in the dialects of modern Arabic are in full vitality throughout the classical period of Arabic literature.The Arabic language itself, ancient and modern, divides into a vast number of dialects, many of which have attained the distinction of producing a literature greater or less. But the dialect of the tribe of Koreish, to which Mohammed belonged, is the one that, naturally, by the circumstance of the Koran&#x27;s composition and diffusion, has become the norm of pure Arabic. Old Arabic poems, some of them produced in &quot;the Ignorance,&quot; that is, before the days of Mohammed, are in substantially the same dialect as that of the Koran, for it appears that Bedouin tribes ranging within the limits of the Arabian desert spoke an Arabic little differentiated by tribal or geographical peculiarities. On the other hand the inhabitants of the coast of the Indian Ocean from Yemen to Oman, and of the island of Socotra off that coast, spoke an Arabic differing widely from that of the northern tribes. The various dialects of this &quot;South-Arabic,&quot; known partly through their daughter-dialects of today (Mehri, Socotri, etc.), partly from the numerous and important inscriptions (&quot;Minaean&quot; and &quot;Sabaean&quot;) found in Yemen by recent travelers, notably Halevy and Glaser, show a closer affinity than do the &quot;North-Arabic&quot; with the Abyssinian dialects (Ge&#x27;ez, i.e. &quot;Ethiopic,&quot; Tigre, Tigrina, Amharic, etc.), as might indeed be expected from the admitted South Arabian origin of the Habesh-tribes or Abyssinians.For the interpretation of the Old T...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ar&#x27;-a-bik vur&#x27;-shuns: Arabic translations of the Bible must have been made at a very early date, for Christianity and Judaism had penetrated far into Arabia by the 6th century of our era, but the oldest of which a copy has come down to our time is that of Sasdish the Gaon (942 AD). This version was made directly from the Massoretic Text and is said to have covered the whole of the Old Testament, but much of it is no longer extant. It is characterized by an avoidance of anthropomorphisms (e.g. Ge 6:2, &quot;sons of nobles&quot; and &quot;daughters of common people&quot;) and by giving modern equivalents, e.g. Turks, Franks, Chinese, for the Hebrew names. Saadiah&#x27;s Pentateuch was first printed at Constantinople in 1546 and was incorporated into the Paris (1629-45) and London (1657) Polyglots.When, after the rise of Islam, Arabic became the common language of Syria, Egypt and North Africa, translations were made from the Septuagint, from the Peshitta and from Coptic. In the Polyglots the translation of Joshua is, like the Pentateuch, made from the Massoretic Text, as also portions of Kings and Nehemiah, with interpolations from the Peshitta. Judges, Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings (in parts), 1 and 2 Chronicles (?), Nehemiah (in parts) and Job have been translated into Arabic from Syriac. The remaining books (Prophets, Psalms, Proverbs, etc.) are from the Septuagint, and that according to Codex Alexandrinus. In the New Testament the Gospels have been translated from the Vulgate, and the remaining books, although from the Greek, are late. A revised edition of the versions in Walton&#x27;s Polyglot was published by J. D. Carlyle, professor of Arabic in Cambridge, and printed at Newcastle by Sarah Hodgson in 1811. A very fine translation of the entire Bible in classical Arabic has been issued by the Jesuit Fathers in Beirut, and a simpler version in Arabic which can be understood by the common people, educated and uneducated alike, was made by the late Dr. Cornelius Van Dyck of the Syrian Protestant College and published by the American Press in Beirut. Dr. Van Dyck had the benefit of the help and advice of the Sheikh Nacif al-Yaziji.A large number of manuscripts of the Bible in Arabic, in whole or in part, are to be found in the British Museum, the Bibliotheque Nationale and the great libraries of the Continent, but none of them are of sufficient age to make them of value for the criticism of the text.Thomas Hunter Weir</p>

Three times it is spoken of as in the South Country, one mention using the phrase `the wilderness of Judah which is in the South Country of Arad&#x27; (Jud 1:16), that is, the part of the wilderness of Judah which is in the South Country near Arad. It was situated near the frontier of Judah and Simeon, being grouped with Debir, Hormah, Makkedah, etc. (Jos 12:14). Arad and other cities joined in attacking Israel in the fortieth year of the sojourn in the wilderness (Nu 21:1-3), and Israel vowed to &quot;make their cities a devoted thing.&quot; In the case of Zephath, one of the cities, this vow was fulfilled after the death of Joshua (Jud 1:17). The Kenite relatives of Moses had their inheritance near Arad (Jud 1:16). In the form a-ru-da the city is mentioned by Shishak of Egypt as among the places which he conquered in Palestine. The identification of the site with Tel Arad, about 17 miles South of Hebron, seems to be generally accepted.(2) One of the descendants of Elpaal the son of Shaharaim, mentioned among the descendants of Benjamin (1Ch 8:15).Willis J.

Comparison of Aramaic of Sinjirli with That of Bible7. Comparison of Aramaic of Assouan with That of Daniel8. Elephantine Papyri9. Comparison with Aramaic of the Targums10. Chief Differences in LatterLITERATUREThe name is given to a form of Semitic speech, most nearly related to Hebrew and Phoenician, but exhibiting marked peculiarities, and subsisting in different dialects. Its original home may have been in Mesopotamia (Aram), but it spread North and West, and, as below shown, became the principal tongue throughout extensive regions. After the return from the Captivity, it displaced Hebrew as the spoken language of the Jews in Palestine. In its eastern form it is known as Syriac. In its occurrence in the Old Testament, it formerly, though incorrectly, generally bore the name Chaldee. The present article deals with it chiefly in its. Old Testament relations.1. Early Notices of Aramaic in Scripture:If we neglect two words which occur in Ge 31:47, the earliest notice of the use of this language in Scripture is in the request which the representatives of Hezekiah make to Rabshakeh: &quot;Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syriac language&quot; (&#x27;aramith, 2Ki 18:26; Isa 36:11). The narrative from which we have made this excerpt, even if it stood alone, would prove that Aramaic, &quot;the Syriac language,&quot; was so different from Hebrew, &quot;the Jews&#x27; language,&quot; that it was not understood by the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Further, it shows that Aramaic was the ordinary language of Assyrian diplomacy. We next meet with Aramaic in Jer 10:11 which appears to be an answer put into the mouths of the Jews as a reply to any attempt to seduce them to the worship of idols. If we assume the traditional date of Daniel to be correct, the six chapters in that book (Da 2:4-7:28), forming the greater part of the whole, are the next and most important occurrence of Aramaic in Scripture. There are, further, passages in Ezr 4:8-6:18; 7:12-26, amounting approximately to three chapters, in which Aramaic is used. In the New Testament several Aramaic words and phrases occur, modified by having passed through Greek2. Extra-Biblical Evidences of Aramaic:Formerly our knowledge of Aramaic earlier than the Targums and the Peshitta was restricted to the above-noticed passages of Scripture. Now, however, discoveries, still comparatively recent, have put us in a different position. In the closing decade of last century extensive inscriptions were discovered in Sibbaldia, in the neighborhood of Aleppo, dated in the reigns of Tiglathpileser and the Sargonid monarchs, and one that seems earlier. More recent has been the discovery of the Assouan papyri; these bear dates which synchronize with Ezra and Nehemi...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ar&#x27;-a-rat (&#x27;araraT): A mountainous plateau in western Asia from which flow in different directions the Euphrates, the Tigris, the Aras and the Choruk rivers. Its general elevation is 6,000 feet above the sea. Lake Van, which like the Dead Sea has no outlet, is nearly in its center. The Babylonian name was Urartu, the consonants being the same in both words. In 2Ki 19:37 and Isa 37:38 the word is translated in the King James Version Armenia, which correctly represents the region designated. It was to Armenia that the sons of Sennacherib fled. In Jer 51:27 Ararat is associated with Minni and Ashkenaz, which according to the Assyrian monuments lay just to the east of Armenia. In Ge 8:4 the ark is said to have rested &quot;upon the mountains of Ararat,&quot; i.e. in the mountainous region of Armenia, the plural showing that the mountain peak known as Ararat was not referred to. This peak is of volcanic origin and lies outside the general region, rising from the lowlands of the Araxes (Aras) River to a height of 17,000 feet, supported by another peak seven miles distant, 13,000 feet high. It is only in comparatively modern times that the present name has been given to it. The Armenians still call it Massis, but believe, however, that Noah was buried at Nachitchevan near its base.The original name of the kingdom occupying Armenia was Bianias, which Ptolemy transliterated Byana. Later the &quot;B&quot; was modified into &quot;V&quot; and we have the modern Van, the present capital of the province. The &quot;mountains of Ararat&quot; on which the ark rested were probably those of the Kurdish range which separates Armenia from Mesopotamia and Kurdistan. In the Babylonian account the place is called &quot;the mountain of Nizir&quot; which is east of Assyria. Likewise Berosus locates the place &quot;in the mountain of the Kordyaeans&quot; or Kurds (Ant., I, iii, 6), while the Syriac version has Hardu in Gen. 8:4 instead of Ararat. The Kurds still regard Jebel Judi, a mountain on the boundary between Armenia and Kurdistan, as the place where the ark rested.This elevated plateau of Armenia has still many attractions, and is eminently suited to have been the center from which the human race spread in all directions. Notwithstanding its high elevation the region is fertile, furnishing abundant pasture, and producing good crops of wheat and barley, while the vine is indigenous. Moreover there are unmistakable indications that in early historic times there was a much more abundant rainfall in all that region than there is now, so that the climate was then better adapted to the wants of primitive man. This is shown by the elevated beaches surrounding lakes Van, Urumiah, and, indeed, all the lakes of central Asia. Great quantities of mammoth bones have been found in these bordering lacustrine deposits corresponding to those found in the glacial and postglacial deposits of Europe and America. It should, also, be remembered that the drying up of the waters of the flood is represented to have been very gradual--it being 170 da...</p>

Educated in Rome, he imbibed Roman ideas and became a faithful ally of the Romans, in conformity with whose wishes he declined a proposal of marriage with the sister of Demetrius Soter. The latter declared war, drove Arathes from his kingdom and set up Holophernes in his stead. He fled to Rome about 158, and through the good offices of the Romans succeeded in obtaining for himself a participation in the government of Cappadocia. Later he again became sole king. In 139 BC, as a result of an embassy sent by Simon Maccabeus, the Romans wrote letters to Arathes (1 Macc 15:22) and other eastern kings in behalf of the Jews. (See Diodor.

It cannot be identified with certainty. Ewald (Hist, V, 314, English translation) favors el- BaTeicha, the plain through which the Jordan flows into the Lake of Galilee. Encyclopedia Biblica (s.v.) suggests &quot;the Arabah, or Araboth of Jordan.&quot; Possibly however we should look for it in the toparchy of Akrabattis, to the Southeast of Shechem (BJ, III, iii, 4 f).W.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ar-be&#x27;-la (en Arbelois): This place is mentioned in 1 Macc 9:1 ff, and in Ant, XII, xi, 1, describing the march and encampment of Bacchides. The former says that &quot;Demetrius sent Bacchides and Alcimus into the land of Judea .... who went forth by the way that leadeth to Galgala, and pitched their tents before Masaloth, which is in Arbela, and after they had won it they slew much people.&quot; Josephus says that Bacchides &quot;marched out of Antioch and came into Judea and pitched his camp at Arbela, a city of Galilee, and having besieged and taken those that were there in caves (for many people fled into such places) he removed and made all the haste he could to Jerusalem.&quot; It was from the caves near the village of Arbela in Galilee that Herod dislodged the robbers (Ant., XIV, xv, 4 f; BJ, I, xvi, 2 ff). Josephus fortified the caves of Arbela in lower Galilee (Vita, 37), &quot;near the lake of Gennesar&quot; (BJ, II, xx, 6). The references in Josephus point plainly to the caves in the cliff forming the south wall of the tremendous gorge of Wady el-Chamam which opens on the plain of Gennesaret, west of the village el-Mejdel. A series of these caves, skillfully adapted to purposes of refuge and defense, is still known as Qal`at ibn Ma`an, &quot;fortress of the son of Ma`an.&quot; On the height above stand the ruins of Irbid or Irbil (both forms are heard today), which unquestionably represent the Arbela of Josephus. The army from Antioch may quite well have come this way. No name however in the least resembling Masaloth has been recovered in this district. We may mention Robinson&#x27;s suggestion (BR, II, 398, note), that it may stand for the Hebrew mecilloth, &quot;steps, stories, terraces,&quot; and may apply to the fortress in the rocks.On the other hand the writer of 1 Macc is an earlier authority than Josephus. If we accept his guidance, Bacchides must have crossed the plain of Esdraelon and followed the main highway southward through Samaria. Galgala may then be identified with Jiljilia, about 8 miles North of Bethel, and Masaloth with Meselieh, about 3 miles Southeast of Dothan. Onomasticon mentions an Arbela in the great plain, 9 miles from Legio (Lejun), but it is now unknown. The phrase en arbelois might mean that Masaloth was in the district of Arbela; but there is no trace of this name as attaching to any tract in this neighborhood.One or other of these routes must have been taken. While no certain decision can be reached, special weight attaches to the statement of Josephus, on account of his acquaintance with the localities in the region, and his unquestionable familiarity with the history.

Thus &quot;Archaeology and Criticism,&quot; the title of this article, is meant to designate the bearing of the archaeology of Bible lands upon the criticism, especially the Higher Criticism, of the Bible. The subject as thus defined calls for the discussion of, I. What archaeology can do in the case--the powers, rights and authority, that is to say, the Function of archaeology in criticism; and II. What archaeology has done in the case, the resulting effects of such archaeological evidence, that is to say, the History of the bearing of archaeology upon the criticism of the Bible.I. Function.The function of archaeology in criticism has only recently been given much attention and the opinions thereon have varied greatly.(a) Ignored by Encyclopaedists:Biblical encyclopaedists generally, until the most recent, have not given this subject a place at all (Hastings Dictionary of the Bible, Encyclopedia Biblica, Smith, Dictionary of the Bible, Kitto, Encyclopedia of Biblical Literature, Hamburger, See Hauck-Herzog, Realencyklopadie fur protestantische Theologie und Kirche, Eadie, Biblical Encyclopedia). McClintock and Strong&#x27;s Encyclopedia Biblical and Ecclesiastical Literature has an article on &quot;Biblical Archeology&quot; consisting entirely of bibliography , also an article of a general character under &quot;Sac. Ant.&quot; The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge Encyclopedia has an article, The Catholic Encyclopedia, 1907, has an article under the title &quot;Biblical Antiquities,&quot; and the Jewish Encyclopedia, 1902, has an article of five pages on &quot;Biblical Archeology&quot; But on the function of archaeology in criticism there is almost nothing anywhere.(b) Variously Estimated by Critics:Critics have varied much in their estimate of the value of archaeology in criticism, according to their individual predilections and their critical theories, but until very recently archaeology has not generally been given a commanding, or even a prominent, place in criticism. Wellhausen seems to declare for the dominance of archaeology in criticism in the beginning of his History of Israel, though he very much ignores it in the pages that follow (History of Israel, 12). Driver (Authority and Archaeology, 143-50), thinks &quot;testimony of archaeology sometimes determines the question decisively,&quot; but is &quot;often strangely misund...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(1) The art of using the arcus, or bow and arrow for hunting and in battle is of great antiquity. It is mentioned in Ge 21:20, as well as in the Iliad and the Odyssey, and depicted on Egyptian monuments and in Assyrian sculptures. The Philistines excelled in the art, which led David to order that special training in it be given to the Hebrews (2Sa 1:18). It was an important art throughout the world in Biblical times (see Ge 27:3; Isa 22:6; 49:2; Ps 127:4). The Benjamites among the Hebrews were noted as archers (Jud 20), and archers constituted much of the fighting strength, and played no mean part in the victories, of the world-famed Greek and Roman armies.(2) The bow was common to civil (Ge 21:20) and military life (Zec 9:10), and vies with the spear in importance and antiquity. It was usually made of tough, elastic, seasoned wood, and often mounted with bronze (see Ps 18:34 Revised Version (British and American); compare Job 20:24). But horn, too, was used for bows by the ancients, some with double curves being evidently modeled after the horns of oxen. The bow-string was commonly ox-gut and the arrows were of reed, or light wood tipped with flint, bronze, or iron.(3) The battle bows, such as are mentioned in Zec 9:10; 10:4, must have been of great size, since they required to be strung by pressing the foot on the lower end, while the upper end was bent down to receive the string into a notch; hence the expression &quot;to tread (= string) the bow,&quot; and &quot;bowtreaders,&quot; for archers (Jer 50:14,29 Hebrew). The arrows, &quot;the sons of his quiver&quot; (La 3:13 margin, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;shafts&quot;), were ordinarily, of course, carried in the quiver, which was either placed on the back or slung on the left side, secured by a belt over the right shoulder (HDB). The day of gunpowder and firearms, of course, was not yet.George B. Eager</p>

The latter condition was that of the Jews in Palestine; they failed so to establish themselves that their character and aims could find true expression in architecture. The country by reason of its geographical position and its broken territorial character, which exaggerat edition the tribal nature of its inhabitants, did not favor political empire (see HGHL, 10). The great difficulty of the Jews was the preservation of their own integrity. There could be no victorious expeditions to foreign lands to inspire monumental evidence of achievement in arms, nor had they the inspiration. of various gods or saints, to whose glory great and separate buildings might be raised. Their dwellings were, by force of circumstances, unpretentious, and their tombs were of the same character.1. Plans, Estimates and Measuring:Although in the smaller buildings there is very little evidence of the builder having been governed by a previously drawn plan, there seems no doubt that in larger works a plan was prepared. The Tabernacle was made according to a &quot;pattern&quot; (Ex 25:9) and Solomon&#x27;s Temple was also designed and submitted for approval (1Ch 28:11). Estimated cost was also considered (Lu 14:28). The equivalents to a tape line and foot rule can be identified (Eze 40:3,5; 47:3; Re 11:1; 21:15).The Israelites arrived in tents, and the walled cities, &quot;great and walled up to heaven&quot; (De 1:28 the King James Version) which they took and occupied were well fortified, unlovely shelters, covering areas of anything from 12 acres, as at Taanach and Megiddo, to about 23 acres as at Gezer (Canaan d&#x27;apres l&#x27;exploration recente). The habitations within the walls were poor structures of mud bricks or rude stone; in many cases they were rock-cut caves. True, the Jews attempted, at the outset of their full pos session, to build in beauty, and made efforts toward greater substantiality, using the best available help; the attempt, however, was doomed to failure. Their most important buildings were their fortifications. The engineering skill displayed in the construction of aqueducts and other water systems was forced out of them by sheer necessity, and proved the existence of a latent construct...</p>

Mars&#x27; Hill, 17:22 the King James Version): A sort of spur jutting out from the western end of the Acropolis and separated from it by a very short saddle. Traces of old steps cut in the rock are still to be seen. Underneath are deep grottoes, once the home of the Eumenides (Furies). On the flat surface of the summit are signs still visible of a smoothing of the stone for seats. Directly below to the North was the old Athenian agora, or market-place. To the East, on the descent from the Acropolis, could be seen in antiquity a small semicircular platform--the orchestra--from which rose the precipitous rock of the citadel. Here the booksellers kept their stalls; here the work of Anaxagoras could be bought for a drachma; from here his physical philosophy was disseminated, then, through Euripides, the poetic associate of Socrates and the sophists, leavened the drama, and finally reached the people of Athens. Then came the Stoics and Epicureans who taught philosophy and religion as a system, not as a faith, and spent their time in searching out some new thing in creed and dogma and opinion. Five centuries earlier Socrates was brought to this very Areopagus to face the charges of his accusers.To this same spot the apostle Paul came almost five hundred years after 399 BC, when the Attic martyr was executed, with the same earnestness, the same deep-rooted convictions, and with even greater ardor, to meet the philosophers of fashion. The Athenian guides will show you the exact place where the apostle stood, and in what direction he faced when he addressed his audience. No city has ever seen such a forest of statues as studded the market-place, the streets and the sides and summit of the Acropolis of Athens. A large part of this wealth of art was in full view of the speaker, and the apostle naturally made this extraordinary display of votive statues and offerings the starting-point of his address. He finds the Athenians extremely religious. He had found an altar to a god unknown. Then he develops theme of the great and only God, not from the Hebrew, but from the Greek, the Stoic point of view. His audiences consisted, on the one hand, of the advocates of prudence as the means, and pleasure as the end (the Epicureans); on the other, of the advocates of duty, of living in harmony with the intelligence which rules the world for good. He frankly expresses his sympathy with the nobler principles of the Stoic doctrine. But neither Stoic nor Epicurean could believe the declarations of the apostle: the latter believed death to be the end of all things, the former thought that the soul at death was absorbed again into that from which it sprang. Both understood Paul as proclaiming to them in Jesus and Anastasis (&quot;resurrection&quot;) some new deities. When they finally ascertained that Jesus was ordained by God to judge the world, and that Anastasis was merely the resurrection of the dead, they were disappointed. Some scoffed, othe...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ar&#x27;-e-tas (Aretas): The name is a common one among Arabian princes and signifies &quot;virtuous or pleasing.&quot;1. 2 Macc 5:8:It is mentioned several times in Biblical literature and in Josephus. Here it refers to an Arabian king, who was a contemporary of Antiochus Epiphanes (circa 170 BC), before whom Jason the high priest was accused.2. Obodas:Another Arabian prince of this name, surnamed Obodas (Ant., XIII, xv, 2; xvi, 2; XVI, ix, 4) defeated Antiochus Dionysius and reigned over Coele-Syria and Damascus. He participated with Hyrcanus in the war for the Jewish throne against his brother Aristobulus, but the allies were completely defeated at Papyron, by Aristobulus and Scaurus, the Roman general. The latter carried the war into Arabia and forced Aretas to make an ignominious peace, at the price of three hundred talents of silver. Of that event a memorial denarius still exists, with a Roman chariot in full charge on the one side and a camel on the other, by the side of which an Arab is kneeling, who holds out a branch of frankincense.3. Aeneas:The successor of Obodas was apparently surnamed Aeneas and this is the Arabian king who figures in the New Testament (2Co 11:32; compare Ac 9:24). The Aretas, here mentioned, is the father-in-law of Herod Antipas, who divorced his wife to marry Herodins, the wife of his brother Philip (Mt 14:3; Mr 6:17; Lu 3:19). Josephus (Ant., XVIII, v, 1,3) gives us a circumstantial narration of the events leading up to and following the conduct of Antipas. Coupled with a boundary dispute, it occasioned a bitter w ar between the two princes, in which Antipas was completely overwhelmed, who thereupon invoked the aid of the Romans. Tiberius ordered Vitellius, proconsul of Syria, to make war on Aretas and to deliver him dead or alive into the hands of the emperor. On the way, at Jerusalem, Vitellius received intelligence of the death of Tiberius, March 16, 37 AD, and stopped all warlike proceedings (Ant., XVIII, v, 1,3). According to 2Co 11:32, Damascus, which had formerly belonged to the Arabian princes, was again in the hands of Are tas, when Paul escaped from it, not immediately after his conversion, but on a subsequent visit, after his Arabian exile (Ga 1:16,17). It is inconceivable that Aretas should have taken Damascus by force, in the face of the almost omnipotent power of Rome. The picture moreover, which Josephus draws of the Herodian events, points to a passive rather than an active attitude on the part of Aretas. The probability is that Cajus Caligula, the new emperor, wishing to settle the affairs of Syria, freely gave Damascu s to Aretas, inasmuch as it had formerly belonged to his territory. As Tiberius died in 37 AD, and as the Arabian affair was completely settled in 39 AD, it is evident that the date of Paul&#x27;s conversion must lie somewhere between 34 and 36 AD. This date is further fixed by a Damascus coin, with the image of King Aretas and the date 101. If that date points to the Pompeian era, it equals 37 AD, m...</p>

The context deals with Pekah&#x27;s conspiracy against Pekahiah; but it is not clear, owing to the state of the text, whether Argob and his associate Arieh (if these are the names of men) were officers of Pekahiah who were slain with him, or fellow- conspirators with Pekah. The vulg takes them as names of places; they may then be considered glosses that have crept into the text. Rashi holds that Argob was the royal palace.

Havvoth-jair lay not in Bashan but in Gilead (Jud 10:4; Nu 32:40 f; 1Ki 4:13). It contained threescore cities. &quot;All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates and bars; besides the unwalled towns a great many.&quot; De 3:14 seems to say that it marched with Geshur and Maacah; but we cannot lay stress on this. We may take it that Argob lay in the land of Bashan; beyond this, on available data, we cannot certainly go.The word chebhel, translated &quot;region,&quot; means primarily a line or cord, then &quot;a measuring line,&quot; then &quot;the portion measured,&quot; e.g. &quot;the part of the children of Judah&quot; (Jos 19:9), the &quot;lot&quot; or &quot;portion&quot; of an inheritance (De 32:9; Jos 17:14, etc.). Chebhel precedes Argob in each of the four cases where it is named. This has led many to think that a district with very clearly marked borders is intended. No region so well meets this condition as el-Leja&#x27;, a volcanic tract lying about 20 miles South of Damascus, and 30 miles East of the Sea of Galilee. It is roughly triangular in form, with the apex to the North, and is about 25 miles long, with a base of some 20 miles. The lava which has hardened into this confused wilderness of black rock, rent and torn by countless fissures, flowed from the craters whose dark forms are seen on the East.It rises to an average height of about 20 ft. above the plain, on which it lies like an island on a sea of emerald, the edges being sharply defined. At all points it is difficult of entrance, and might be defended by a few resolute men against an army. To this fact doubtless it owes its name el-Leja&#x27;, &quot;the refuge.&quot; There are many traces of considerable cities in the interior. The present writer collected there the names of no fewer than seventy-one ruined sites. See further TRACHONITIS. This identification is supported by taking &#x27;argobh as the Hebrew equivalent of the Greek trachon, &quot;stony.&quot; This is possible only if, as Gesenius assumes, the root raghabh is cognate with ragham, an extremely precarious assumption. &quot;Clod&quot; is the translation of the word reghebh in Job 21:33; 38:38; probably therefore &#x27;argobh should be tendered &quot;a region of clods,&quot; i.e. &quot;arable land.&quot; This practically rules out el-Leja&#x27;.We have seen above that the term chebhel need have no reference to the clearly marked rocky boundaries. As regards the great cities, all Bashan is studded with the ruins of such. The splendid remains that everywhere meet the traveler&#x27;s eye were thought by Porter (Giant Cities of Bashan) and others, to be the wreck of the great cities that struck the invading Israelites with wonder. It is now clear that the ruins above ground are not older than the beginning of our era. The Greek and Roman architecture is easily recognized. Probably, however, excavation will prove that in ver...</p>

The Onomasticon of Eusebius and Jerome identifies it with Ramathaim- Zophim in the hill-country of Ephraim (1Sa 11), which is Ramah the birthplace and burial-place of Samuel (1Sa 1:19; 25:1), and places it near Timnah on the borders of Judah and Dan.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ar&#x27;-i-ok: (&#x27;aryokh):(1) The name of the vassal king of Ellasar, under Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Amraphel, king of Shinar (Babylonia), who took part in the expedition against Sodom, Gomorrah and other states (Ge 14:1,9). Assyriologists generally, and probably rightly, identify Arioch with Eri-Aku (which see), king of Larsa, Ellasar being for Al-Larsa (now Sinqara in central Babylonia).Texts Referring to the Reign of Arioch:For an account of the expedition see AMRAPHEL, and for the Babylonian texts bearing upon the reign, see ERI-AKU. In Ge 14:1,9, where the names of the allied kings who marched against the Cities of the Plain are given, that of Arioch follows his more immediate suzerain, Amraphel, and not Chedorlaomer, who, however, appears to have been the real overlord (verse 4), which agrees with the indications of the Bah records. No details of the expedition are available from Babylonian sources. Besides Larsa, Eri-Aku&#x27;s inscriptions inform us that Ur (Muqayyar, Mugheir) was in the principality of which Larsa was the capital.(2) The Arioch of Da 2:14,25 was captain of the bodyguard of King Nebuchadnezzar. Nothing else is known about him except that it was he who was commanded to slay the &quot;wise men&quot; who failed to repeat to the king his dream and its interpretation; and who communicated to his royal master that Daniel had undertaken the task.T.

He is suddenly mentioned along with Gaius as having been seized by the excited Ephesians during the riot stirred up by the silversmiths (Ac 19:29). They are designated &quot;men of Macedonia, Paul&#x27;s companions in travel.&quot; We learn later that he was a native of Thessalonica (Ac 20:4; 27:2). They were probably seized to extract from them information about their leader Paul, but when they could tell nothing, and since they were Greeks, nothing further was done to them.When Aristarchus attached himself to Paul we do not know, but he seems ever after the Ephesian uproar to have remained in Paul&#x27;s company. He was one of those who accompanied Paul from Greece via Macedonia (Ac 20:4). Having preceded Paul to Troas, where they waited for him, they traveled with him to Palestine. He is next mentioned as accompanying Paul to Rome (Ac 27:2). There he attended Paul and shared his imprisonment. He is mentioned in two of the letters of the Roman captivity, in the Epistle to the church at Col 4:10, and in the Epistle to Phm (Phm 1:24), in both of which he sends greetings. In the former Paul calls him &quot;my fellow-prisoner.&quot; According to tradition he was martyred during the persecution of Nero.S. F. Hunter</p>

Three other brothers and his mother he cast into prison, where they died of starvation. He murdered Antigonus, and died conscience-stricken himself in 104 BC. See MACCABEES.(2) Aristobulus, nephew of the former, dethroned his mother, Alexandra (69 BC), and forced his brother Hyrcanus to renounce the crown and mitre in his favor. In 64 Pompey came to Palestine and supported the cause of Hyrcanus. See HYRCANUS. Aristobulus was defeated and taken prisoner, and Hyrcanus was appointed ethnarch in 63 BC. Aristobulus and his two daughters were taken to Rome, where he graced the triumph of Pompey. The father escaped later (56 BC) and appeared in Palestine again as a claimant to the throne. Many followers flocked to his standard, but he was finally defeated, severely wounded and taken prisoner a second time and with his son, Antigonus, again taken to Rome. Julius Caesar not only restored him to freedom (49 BC), but also gave him two legions to recover Judea, and to work in his interest against Pompey. But Quintus Metellus Scipio, who had just received Syria as a province, had Aristobulus poisoned as he was on his way to Palestine.CR(3) Grandson of the preceding, and the last of the Maccabean family. See ASMONEANS.(4) The Jewish teacher of Ptol. VII (2 Macc 1:10).(5) An inhabitant of Rome, certain of whose household are saluted by Paul (Ro 16:10). He was probably a grandson of Herod and brother of Herod Agrippa, a man of great wealth, and intimate with the emperor Claudius. Lightfoot (Philippians, 172) suggests that &quot;the household of Aristobulus&quot; were his slaves, and that upon his death they had kept together and had become the property of the emperor either by purchase or as a legacy, in which event, however, they might, still retain the name of their former master. Among these were Christians to whom Paul sends greeting.M. O. Evans</p>

Definitions:The Hebrew word here translated &quot;ark&quot; is used in the Old Testament only of the ark of Noah (Ge 6:14 ff) and of the ark of bulrushes (Ex 2:3), and always in the secondary meaning, a vessel to float. The Septuagint translates it of Noah&#x27;s ark by kibotos, &quot;a casket,&quot; and of the ark of bulrushes by thibis, a little basket made of osiers or flags. For the Ark of the Covenant, the Hebrew employed a different word (&#x27;aron, &quot;a chest&quot;). Bulrushes (gome&#x27;, &quot;papyrus&quot;): This species of reed was used by the Egyptians for many different vessels, some of which were intended to float or even to be used as a skiff. Slime (chemar, &quot;bitumen&quot;), pitch (zepheth, &quot;pitch&quot;) was probably the sticky mud of the Nile with which to this day so many things in Egypt are plastered. In this case it was mixed with bitumen. Flags (cuph, &quot;sedge&quot;) were reeds of every kind and tall grass growing in the shallow water at the edge of the river.2. History:Thus the ark of bulrushes was a vessel made of papyrus stalks and rendered fit to float by being covered with a mixture of bitumen and mud. Into this floating vessel the mother of Moses placed the boy when he was three months old, and put the vessel in the water among the sedge along the banks of the Nile at the place where the ladies from the palace were likely to come to bathe. The act was a pathetic imitation of obedience to the king&#x27;s command to throw boy babies into the river, a command which she had for three months braved and which now she so obeyed as probably to bring the cruelty of the king to the notice of the royal ladies in such way as to arouse a womanly sympathy, A similar story is related of Sargon I of Babylonia (Records of the Past, 1st series, V, 1-4; Rogers, Hist. Babylonian and Assyrian, I, 362).The one story in no wise discredits the other. That method of abandoning children, either willingly or by necessity, is as natural along the Nile and the Euphrates, where the river is the great artery of the land and where the floating basket had been used from time immemorial, as is the custom in our modern cities of placing abandoned infants in the streets or on door-steps where they are likely to be found, and such events probably occurred then as often as now.M.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ark, no&#x27;-a: A structure built by Noah at the command of God to preserve from the Flood a remnant of the human race and of the animals associated with man. It was constructed of &quot;gopher wood&quot; (Ge 6:14)--very likely the cypress used extensively by the Phoenicians for ship-building. It was divided into rooms or nests, and was three stories high, pitched within and without with bitumen or &quot;asphalt,&quot; of which there are extensive deposits at Hit, in the Euphrates valley, a little above Babylon. It was 300 cubits long, 50 cubits broad, 30 cubits high, which according to Petrie&#x27;s estimate of a cubit as 22.5 inches would make it to be 562 1/2 ft. long, 93 2/3 ft. wide, 56 1/4 ft. deep, which are natural proportions of a ship of that size. The dimensions of the &quot;Great Eastern,&quot; built in 1858, were 692 ft. long, 83 ft. broad, 58 ft. deep; those of the &quot;Celtic&quot; built in 1901 are 700 ft. long, 75 ft. wide, 49 1/3 ft. deep. It is extremely improbable that such reasonable dimensions should have been assigned to the Ark except they were based on fact. Unrestrained tradition would have been sure to distort the proportions, as is shown by what actually occurred in other accounts of the Ark. The cuneiform tablets represent it as six stories high, with the length, width, and depth, each as 140 cubits (262 ft.), and having a mast on top of all, and a pilot to guide the impossible craft (see Deluge Tablet, ll.22, 23, 38-41). Berosus, the Greek historian, represents it to have been five stadia (3,000 ft.) long and two stadia (1,200 ft.) broad, while Origen, in order to confound Celsus (Against Celsus 4.41) gave the figures an interpretation which made the Ark 25 miles long and 3/4 of a mile wide.It is needless to speculate upon the capacity of the Ark for holding absolutely all the species of animals found in the world, together with the food necessary for them, since we are only required to provide for such animals as were native to the area to which the remnants of the human race living at that time were limited, and which (see DELUGE OF NOAH) may not have been large. But calculations show that the structure described contained a space of about 3,500,000 cubic feet, and that after storing food enough to support several thousand pairs of animals, of the average size, on an ocean voyage of a year, there would remain more than 50 cubic feet of space for each pair.No mention is made in the Bible of a pilot for the Ark, but it seems to have been left to float as a derelict upon the waters. For that purpose its form and dimensions were perfect, as was long ago demonstrated by the celebrated navigator, Sir Walter Raleigh, who notes it had &quot;a flat bottom, and was not raised in form of a ship, with a sharpness forward, to cut the waves for the better speed&quot;--a construction which secured the maximum of storage capacity and made a vessel which would ride steadily upon the water. Numerous vessels after the pattern of the Ark, but of smaller dimensions, have been made in Holland ...</p>

The Statements of the Old Testament Concerning the Ark of the Covenant.1. Pentateuch:In Ex 25:10 ff, Moses receives the command to build an ark of acacia wood. Within this ark were to be placed the tables of the law which God was about to give to Moses. Upon the top of the ark, probably not as a lid but above the lid, the kapporeth, in the New Testament to hilasterion (Heb 9:5), is to be placed, which was a golden plate upon which two cherubim, with raised wings and facing each other, covered the ark. From the place between the two cherubim God promises to speak to Moses, as often as He shall give him commands in reference to the Israelites.The portion of the Pentateuch in which this is recorded is taken from the so-called Priest Codex (P). The reports of the Elohist (E) and the Jahwist (Jahwist) on this subject are wanting; but both of these sources report concerning the important role which the ark played in the entrance of Israel into Canaan, and these documents too must have contained the information that the people had received this ark. It can further with certainty be stated concerning the Elohist, and with some probability concerning the Jahwist, in what part of these documents these accounts were to be found. For Elohist reports in Ex 33:6 that the Israelites, in order to demonstrate their repentance on account of the golden calf, had at God&#x27;s command laid aside their ornaments. In 33:7-10 there follows a statement concerning the erection of the sacred tent; but this is explained only by the fact that between 33:6 and 7 a report concerning the erection of the ark of the covenant must have been found, which the R of the Pentateuch (since before this he had already made use of the much more exhaustive account of the Priest Codex) was compelled to omit.But that at this place the Elohist must have reported not only concerning the erection of the sacred tent but also of the construction of the ark of the covenant, is in itself probable, and can too be concluded from this, that according to the Deuteronomist, the composition of which is also conditioned upon that of the Elohist and the Jahwist, the ark was built on this occasion. We further conclude that it was not so much the tabernacle which could serve as a consolation to the people, something that at that time they needed, but rather the ark, which was to symbolize to them that God was on the march with them. In the Jahwist we do not indeed find at this place any statement concerning this sacred structure, but we do find the statement that the Israelites, out of sorrow because of the bad news brought by Moses, discarded their ornaments.For Ex 33:4 is taken from the Jahwist, since the Elohist contains the command to discard the ornaments later on, and hence could not have written 33:4. Now it is a justifiable surmise that the Jahwist has also reported what use was made of the ornaments that had been discarded; and as this author, just as is the case with the...</p>

Chotsen is really &quot;bosom,&quot; thus the Revised Version (British and American) (Isa 49:22); and katheph is &quot;shoulder,&quot; thus the Revised Version (British and American) (Job 31:22). Compare cheir, also, in Ac 11:21.Figurative: The arm denotes influence, power, means of support or conquest. The arms of Moab (Jer 48:25) and of Pharaoh (Eze 30:21 ff) are broken. The arm of Eli and the arm of his father&#x27;s house are to be cut off (1Sa 2:31). Because the arm wielded the sword it signified &quot;oppression&quot; (Job 35:9). The arms are the means of support, therefore to refuse to aid the fatherless is to break their arms (Job 22:9).Applied anthropomorphically to God, the arm denotes also His power, power to deliver, support, conquer. His &quot;outstretched arm&quot; delivered Israel from Egypt (Ex 6:6; De 4:34, etc.). They support: &quot;Underneath are the everlasting arms&quot; (De 33:27). His arm protects (Isa 40:11). Yahweh is sometimes likened to a warrior and smites with His arm (Ps 89:10; Isa 63:5; Jer 21:5). The arm of Yahweh is holy (Ps 98:1; Isa 52:10). Many other passages of Scripture might be quoted showing how the power of God to redeem, judge, protect, punish is expressed by the idea of &quot;the arm of Yahweh.&quot;S. F. Hunter</p>

Throughout the Bible, this is a country, not a mountain. Armenia Major was bounded on the North by the River Cyrus (Kour), Iberia, Colchis, and the Moschici Mts.; on the West by Asia Minor and the Euphrates; on the South by Mesopotamia and Assyria; on the East by the Caspian and Media. (Armenia Minor lay between the Euphrates and the Halys.) Ararat was originally the name of the central district. Most of Armenia is between 8,000 and 3,000 feet above sea-level, and slopes toward Euphrates, Cyrus, and the Gaspian. Mt. Massis (generally called Greater Ararat) is 16,969 ft. and Lesser Ararat, 12,840 ft. Both are of igneous origin, as is Aragds (A`la Goz), 13,436 ft. Sulphur springs and earthquakes still attest volcanic activity.The largest rivers are the Euphrates, Tigris and Araxes. The latter, swift and famed for violent floods, joins the Cyrus, which falls into the Caspian. The lakes Van, Urmi and Sevan are veritable inland seas. The many mountain chains, impassable torrents and large streams divide the country into districts far less accessible from one another than from foreign lands. Hence, invasions are easy and national union difficult. This has sadly affected the history of Armenia. Xenophon (Anab. iv.5) describes the people as living in houses partly underground, such as are still found. Each village was ruled by its chief according to ancient customary laws. He well describes the severity of the winters. In summer the climate in some places is like that of Italy or Spain. Much of Armenia is extremely fertile, producing large herds of horses and cattle, abundant crops of cereals, olives and fruit. It is rich in minerals, and is probably the home of the rose and the vine.LITERATURE.Minas Gaphamatzean; Garagashean; Palasanean; Entir Chatouadsner, I; Rawlinson, Seven Anc.

Turanian Armenians:The country is first mentioned in Ge 8:4 as the land upon (some one of) the mountains of which Noah&#x27;s Ark rested. (According to Jewish tradition this was one of the Kurdish mountains.) It is next spoken of by Sargon I of Agade, circa 3800 BC, as among his conquests. In early Babylonian legends Armenia figures as an almost unknown land far to the North, full of high mountains and dense forests, containing the entrance to the Lower World (Mad Nu-ga, &quot;Land of No Return&quot;).

Ancient Armenian.1. Circumstances under Which Made:Armenia was in large measure Christianized by Gregory Lousavorich (&quot;the Illuminator&quot;: consecrated 302 AD; died 332), but, as Armenian had not been reduced to writing, the Scriptures used to be read in some places in Greek, in others in Syriac, and translated orally to the people. A knowledge of these tongues and the training of teachers were kept up by the schools which Gregory and King Tiridates had established at the capital Vagharshapat and elsewhere. As far as there was any Christianity in Armenia before Gregory&#x27;s time, it had been almost exclusively under Syrian influence, from Edessa and Samosata. Gregory introduced Greek influence and culture, though maintaining bonds of union with Syria also.When King Sapor of Persia became master of Armenia (378 AD), he not only persecuted the Christians most cruelly, but also, for political reasons, endeavored to prevent Armenia from all contact with the Byzantine world. Hence his viceroy, the renegade Armenian Merouzhan, closed the schools, proscribed Greek learning, and burnt all Greek books, especially the Scriptures. Syriac books were spared, just as in Persia itself; but in many cases the clergy were unable to interpret them to their people. Persecution had not crushed out Christianity, but there was danger lest it should perish through want of the Word of God. Hence several attempts were made to translate the Bible into Armenian. It is said that Chrysostom, during his exile at Cucusus (404-407 AD), invented an Armenian alphabet and translated the Psalter, but this is doubtful. But when Arcadius ceded almost all Armenia to Sapor about 396 AD, something had to be done. Hence in 397 the celebrated Mesrob Mashtots and Isaac (Sachak) the Catholicos resolved to translate the Bible. Mesrob had been a court secretary, and as such was well acquainted with Pahlavi, Syriac and Greek, in which three languages the royal edicts were then published. Isaac had been born at Constantinople and educated there and at Caesarea. Hence he too was a good Greek scholar, besides being versed in Syriac and Pahlavi, which latter was then the court language in Armenia. But none of these three alphabets was suited to express the sounds of the Armenian tongue, and hence, an alphabet had to be devised for it.2. The Translators:A council of the nobility, bishops and leading clergy was held at Vagharshapat in 402, King Vramshapouch being present, and this council requested Isaac to translate the Scriptures into the vernacular. By 406, Mesrob had succeeded in inventing an alphabet--practically the one still in use--principally by modifying the Greek and the Pahlavi characters, though some think the Pal...</p>

This greatly resembled that of Persia, though Zoroastrianism and its dualistic system were not professed. We are thus enabled to judge how far the religion of the Avesta is due to Zoroaster&#x27;s reformation. Aramazd (Ahura Mazda), creator of heaven and earth, was father of all the chief deities. His spouse was probably Spandaramet (Spenta Armaiti), goddess of the earth, who was later held to preside over the underworld (compare Persephone; Hellenistic). Among her assistants as genii of fertility were Horot and Morot (HaurvataT and AmeretaT), tutelary deities of Mt. Massis (now styled Ararat). Aramazd&#x27;s worship seems to have fallen very much into the background in favor of that of inferior deities, among the chief of whom was his daughter Anahit (Anahita), who had temples in many places. Her statues were often of the precious metals, and among her many names were &quot;Golden Mother&quot; and &quot;Goddess of the Golden Image.&quot;Hence to the present day the word &quot;Golden&quot; enters into many Armenian names. White heifers and green boughs were offered her as goddess of fruitfulness, nor was religious prostitution in her honor uncommon. Next in popularity came her sister Astghik (&quot;the little star&quot;), i.e. the planet Venus, goddess of beauty, wife of the deified hero Vahagn (Verethraghna). He sprang from heaven, earth, and sea, and overthrew dragons and other evil beings. Another of Anahit&#x27;s sisters was Nane (compare Assyrian Nana, Nannaea), afterward identified with Athene. Her brother Mihr (Mithra) had the sun as his symbol in the sky and the sacred fire on earth, both being objects of worship. In his temples a sacred fire was rekindled once a year. Aramazd&#x27;s messenger and scribe was Tiur or Tir, who entered men&#x27;s deeds in the &quot;Book of Life.&quot; He led men after death to Aramazd for judgment. Before birth he wrote men&#x27;s fates on their foreheads. The place of punishment was Dzhokhk&#x27;h (= Persian Duzakh). To the sun and moon sacrifices were offered on the mountain-tops. Rivers and sacred springs and other natural objects were also adored. Prayer was offered facing eastward. Omens were taken from the rustling of the leaves of the sacred Sonean forest. Armavir was the religious capital.Among inferior spiritual existences were the Arlezk&#x27;h, who licked the wounds of those slain in battle and restored them to life. The Parikk&#x27;h were evidently the Pairakas (Peris) of Persia. The Armenian mythology told of huge dragons which sometimes appeared as men, sometimes as worms, or basilisks, elves, sea-bulls, dragon-lions, etc. As in Persia, the demons made darts out of the parings of a man&#x27;s nails to injure him with. Therefore these parings, together with teeth and trimmings of hair, must be hidden in some sacred place.LITERATURE.Eznik Goghbatzi; Agathangelos; Moses of Khorene; Eghishe; Palasanean; Faustus Byzantinus; Chhamchheantz; Plutarch; Strabo; Tacitus.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">arm&#x27;-hol: The Hebrew word &#x27;atstsil, is used in Jer 38:12 in the sense of armpits. When the prophet was pulled up out of the pit by ropes, the armpits were protected with rags and old garments. The meaning in Eze 13:18 the King James Version (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;elbows,&quot; the Revised Version, margin &quot;joints of the hands&quot;) is far from clear. The phrase is used, without doubt, of some ornament or article of dress worn by the false prophetesses and priestesses of Ashtaroth in order to allure the unwary and tempt the simple. The &quot;pillows&quot; were probably &quot;amulets&quot; supposed to have magical virtues, and worn on the arms or wrists.W. W. Davies</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">arm&#x27;-let: The word translated &quot;bracelet&quot; in 2Sa 1:10 the King James Version, probably denotes an &quot;armlet,&quot; or &quot;arm-band,&quot; worn on the upper arm. But it is the same word which with a different context is rendered &quot;ankle- chains&quot; (in Nu 31:50 the Revised Version (British and American)). The &quot;bracelet&quot; of Sirach 21:21 the King James Version, worn upon the right arm, was an &quot;armlet,&quot; as is seen from the list given of Judith&#x27;s ornaments: who &quot;decked herself bravely with her armlets (the Revised Version (British and American) `chains&#x27;) and her bracelets, and her rings, and her ear-rings, and all her ornaments&quot; (Judith 10:4). The nature of the ornaments given in the Revised Version (British and American) as &quot;armlets,&quot; Ex 35:22; Nu 31:50, and in the King James Version as &quot;tablets,&quot; is uncertain.

All warriors of distinction had such an attendant. Rather than perish by the hand of a woman, Abimelech called upon his armor-bearer to give him the finishing stroke (Jud 9:54), and when King Saul&#x27;s armor-bearer refused to do this office for him that he might not become the prisoner of the Philistines, he took a sword himself and fell upon it (1Sa 31:4). David became Saul&#x27;s armor-bearer for a time, and Jonathan&#x27;s armor-bearer was a man of resource and courage (1Sa 14:7).

There are no such descriptions given by the sacred writers as are to be found in Homer, who sets forth in detail the various pieces of armor worn by an Achilles or a Patroclus, and the order of putting them on. There is an account of the armor offensive and defensive of the Philistine Goliath (1Sa 17:5-7); and from a much later time we read of shields and spears and helmets and habergeons, or coats of mail, and bows and slings with which Uzziah provided his soldiers (2Ch 26:14). In Jeremiah&#x27;s ode of triumph over the defeat of Pharaoh-neco, there is mention of the arms of the Egyptians: &quot;Prepare ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle. Harness the horses, and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, put on the coats of mail&quot; (Jer 46:3,4). Of the arms of Assyrian, Chaldean, Egyptian and Hittite soldiery there have come down to us sculptured representations from their ancient monuments, which throw light upon the battlepieces of the Hebrew historians and prophets.II. In the New Testament; Polybius.In the New Testament, Paul describes the panoply of the Christian soldier, naming the essential pieces of the Roman soldier&#x27;s armor--the girdle, the breastplate, the footgear, the shield, the helmet, the sword--although it is to be noticed that his most characteristic weapon, the pilum or spear, is omitted (Eph 6:10-17). In a similar context the same apostle speaks of &quot;the armor&quot; of light (Ro 13:12), &quot;of righteousness on the right hand and on the left&quot; (2Co 6:7). Of the equipment of the Roman soldier in detail, the most useful illustration is the account given by Polybius (vi.23): &quot;The Roman panoply consists in the first place of a shield (thureos). .... Along with the shield is a sword (machaira). .... Next come two javelins (hussoi) and a helmet (perikephalaia), and a greave (knemis). ..... Now the majority, when they have further put on a bronze plate, measuring a span every way, which they wear on their breasts and call a heart-guard (kardiophulax), are completely armed, but those citizens who are assessed at more than 10,000 drachmae wear instead, together with the other arms, cuirasses made of chain mail (halusidotous thorakas).&quot;III.

The First Campaign of History2. In the Wilderness3. The Times after the Conquest4. In the Early Monarchy5. From the Time of Solomon Onward6. Organization of the Hebrew Army7. The Army in the Field8. The Supplies of the Army9. In the New TestamentThe Israelites were not a distinctively warlike people and their glory has been won on other fields than those of war. But Canaan, between the Mediterranean and the desert, was the highway of the East and the battle-ground of nations. The Israelites were, by the necessity of their geographical position, often involved in wars not of their own seeking, and their bravery and endurance even when worsted in their conflicts won for them the admiration and respect of their conquerors.1. The First Campaign of History:The first conflict of armed forces recorded in Holy Scripture is that in Ge 14. The kings of the Jordan valley had rebelled against Chedorlaomer, king of Elam--not the first of the kings of the East to reach the Mediterranean with his armies--and joined battle with him and other kings in the Vale of Siddim. In this campaign Abraham distinguished himself by the rescue of his nephew Lot, who had fallen with all that he possessed into the hands of the Elamite king. The force with which Abraham effected the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him was his own retainers, 318 in number, whom he had armed and led forth in person in his successful pursuit.2. In the Wilderness:When we first make the acquaintance of the Israelites as a nation, they are a horde of fugitives who have escaped from the bitter oppression and hard bondage of Pharaoh. Although there could have been but little of the martial spirit in a people so long and grievously oppressed, their journeyings through the wilderness toward Canaan are from the first described as the marching of a great host. It was according to their &quot;armies&quot; (&quot;hosts&quot; the Revised Version (British and American)) that Aaron and Moses were to bring the Children of Israel from the land of Egypt (Ex 6:26). When they had entered upon the wilderness they went up &quot;harnessed&quot; (&quot;armed&quot; the Revised Version (British and American)) for the journeyings that lay before them--where &quot;harnessed&quot; or &quot;armed&quot; may point not to the weapons they bore but to the order and arrangements of a body of troops marching five deep (hamushshim) or divided into five army corps (Ex 13:18).On the way through the wilderness they encamped (Ex 13:20; and passim) at their successive halting-places, and the whole army of 600,000 was, after Sinai, marked off into divisions or army corps, each with its own camp and the ensigns of their fathers&#x27; houses (Nu 2:2). &quot;From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel,&quot; the males of the tribes were numbered and assigned to their place in the camp (Nu 1:3).

Organization.There were originally no standing forces, but the citizens performed military service like any other civic duty when summoned by the magistrates. The gradual development of a military profession and standing army culminated in the admission of the poorest class to the ranks by Marius (about 107 BC). Henceforth the Roman army was made up of a body of men whose character was essentially that of mercenaries, and whose term of continuous service varied in different divisions from 16 to 26 years.The forces which composed the Roman army under the Empire may be divided into the following five groups:(1) the imperial guard and garrison of the capital,(2) the legions,(3) the auxilia,(4) the numeri,(5) the fleet. We shall discuss their organization in the order mentioned.1. The Imperial Guard:The imperial guard consisted of the cohortes praetoriae, which together with the cohortes urbanae and vigiles made up the garrison of Rome. In the military system as established by Augustus there were nine cohorts of the praetorian guard, three of the urban troops, and seven of the vigiles. Each cohort numbered 1,000 men, and was commanded by a tribune of equestrian rank. The praetorian prefects (praefecti praetorii), of whom there were usually two, were commanders of the entire garrison of the capital, and stood at the highest point of distinction and authority in the equestrian career.2. The Legions:There were 25 legions in 23 AD (Tacitus Annals 4, 5), which had been increased to 30 at the time of the reign of Marcus Aurelius, 160-180 AD (CIL, VI, 3492 a-b) and to 33 under Septimius Severus (Dio Cassius, iv. 23-24). Each legion was made up, ordinarily, of 6,000 men, who were divided into 10 cohorts, each cohort containing 3 maniples, and each maniple in turn 2 centuries.The legatus Augustus pro praetore, or governor of each imperial province, was chief commander of all the troops within the province. An officer of senatorial rank known as legatus Augusti legionis was entrusted with the command of each legion, together with the bodies of auxilia which were associated with it. Besides, there were six tribuni militum, officers of equestrian rank (usually sons of senators who had not yet held the quaestorship) in each legion. The centurions who commanded the centuries belonged to the plebeian class. Between the rank of common soldier and centurion there were a large number of subalterns, called principales, who correspond roughly to the non-commissioned officers and men detailed from the ranks for special duties in modern armies.3. The &quot;Auxilia&quot;:The auxilia were organized as infantry in cohortes, as cavalry in alae, or as mixed bodies, cohortes equitatae. Some of these divisions contained approximately 1,000 men (cohortes or alae miliari...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ar&#x27;-non (&#x27;arnon; Arnon): Is first mentioned in Nu 21:24 as the border between Moab and the Amorites. &quot;The valleys of Arnon&quot; in the next verse undoubtedly indicate the numerous wadies contributary to the main stream. It formed the southern boundary of the land assigned to Reuben (De 3:12). The city of Aroer stood on the northern edge of the valley (De 2:36; Jud 12:2, etc.). Arnon was claimed by the Ammonites as having marked the southern limit of their territory when Israel invaded the land (Jud 11:13). They, however, had already been driven out by the Amorites, and the region north of Arnon was held by Sihon. From the inscription of Mesha on the Moabite Stone we gather that Moab had established herself on the north of the Arnon before the time of Omri. Under Omri and Ahab she was confined to the south of the river. A rebellion under Mesha was put down by Jehoram son of Ahab (2Ki 3), and the expedition of Hazael against Israel reached the valley of the Arnon (2Ki 10:33). But according to Mesha he regained for Moab the lost land; and this agrees with Isa 15, 16, where cities north of Arnon are located in Moab, e.g. Heshbon.The modern name of Arnon is Wady el-Mojib, which enters the Dead Sea from the East about 11 miles North of el- Lisan. Some 13 miles East of the Dead Sea two streams, Seil es-Sa`ideh from the South, and Wady Enkeileh from the East, unite their waters and flow westward in the bottom of an enormous trench. The waters of Wady Welch come in from the Northeast. A wide stretch of country thus drains into the valley by means of a great network of smaller wadies--the &quot;valleys of Arnon.&quot; The &quot;fords of the Arnon&quot; (Isa 16:2) were doubtless crossed by Mesha&#x27;s highway which he claims to have built in Arnon; and may be marked by the traces of the old Roman road and bridge immediately to the West of where, on the northern edge of the Wady, stands `Ara`ir, the ancient Aroer.W.

It is one of the cities which Mesha claims to have built, i.e. fortified. It was within the territory allotted to Reuben, yet its building (fortification) is attributed to Gad (Nu 32:34). Thus far came the Syrian, Hazael, in his raid upon Israel (2Ki 10:33). The Roman road across the valley lay about an hour to the West of Khirbet `Ara`ir.(2) A city in Gilead described as &quot;before Rabbah,&quot; on the boundary between Gad and the Ammonites (Jos 13:25). No name resembling this has yet been recovered in the district indicated.(3) A city in the territory of Judah named only in 1Sa 30:28.

Nebuchadrezzar &quot;shall array himself with the land of Egypt&quot; (Jer 43:12).(c) Periballo, &quot;to throw around,&quot; is used 6 times in the New Testament. It is the word used of Herod&#x27;s &quot;arraying&quot; Jesus &quot;in gorgeous apparel&quot; (Lu 23:11; the other references are Mt 6:29; Lu 12:27; Re 7:13; 17:4; 19:8).(d) Enduomai, middle or passive of enduo, &quot;to enter,&quot; means, therefore, &quot;to be entered into&quot; clothing. Once it is used in reference to Herod (Ac 12:21).(e) Himatismos, &quot;clothing,&quot; is translated once &quot;array&quot; = raiment (from same root). This is the only occurrence of &quot;array&quot; in this sense (1Ti 2:9).(2) (a) `Arakh is the common word in the Old Testament, used in reference to the disposition of an army, and is translated &quot;to put in array,&quot; &quot;to set in array,&quot; the object being &quot;the battle&quot; or the army. The root meaning is that of orderly arrangement, and the verb is used in other senses than the military, e. g. arranging the table of shewbread.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ar-sa&#x27;-sez ar&#x27;-sa-sez (Arsakes): The common name assumed by all the Parthian kings, is mentioned in 1 Macc 14:1- 3, and in 15:22 in connection with the history of Demetrius, one of the Greek, or Seleucid, kings of Syria, and successor to Antiochus Epiphanes, the oppressor of the Jews, who caused the uprising against the Syrian domination under the leadership of the Maccabees. This particular Arsaces was the sixth of the line of independent Parthian rulers which had been founded in 250 BC by Arsaces I, who revolted from Antiochus Theos, killed the Syrian satraps, and with his successor Tiridates I firmly established the independence of the Parthian kingdom. About 243 BC, Tiridates added Hyrcania to his dominions; but it was not till the reign of Arsaces VI, whose pre- regnal name was Mithridates, that Parthia through the conquest of Bactria, Media, Persia, Armenia, Elymais and Babylonia, threatened the very existence of the kingdom of the Seleucids and became a dangerous competitor of Rome itself.It was this king who about 141 BC was attacked by Demetrius Nicator, king of Syria. According to the account preserved in 1 Macc 14:1-3, Arsaces sent one of his captains, who went and smote the host of Demetrius, and took him alive, and brought him to Arsaces, by whom he was put in ward. At first, the captive king was treated with great severity, being carried in triumph from city to city and exhibited to his enemies. Later, however, Arsaces gave him his daughter in marriage and assigned him a residence in Hyrcania. Some time after the death of Arsaces, Demetrius was sent back to Syria by Phraates, the son of Mithridates, and reigned from 128 to 125 BC. Arsaces VI is mentioned, also, in 1 Macc 15:22, as one of the kings whom the Romans forbade to make war on their Jewish allies.LITERATURE.See 1 Macc 14:1-3, and 15:22; Ant, XIII, v, 11; XIV, viii, 5; Appian, Syria, 67; Strabo, XI, 515; XV, 702; Justin, XLI, 5, 6; XXXVI, 1; Orosius, V, 4; Rawlinson&#x27;s Parthia, in the Story of the Nations series and Die Herrschaft der Parther in Justi&#x27;s Geschichte des alten Persiens in Oncken&#x27;s Allgemeine Geschichte, I, 4.R.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ar-taks-urk&#x27;-sez (Artaxerxes): Is the Greek and Latin form of one, and perhaps of two or three kings of Persia mentioned in the Old Testament.(1) All are agreed that the Artaxerxes at whose court Ezra and Nehemiah were officials is Artaxerxes I, the son of Xerxes, commonly called Longimanus, who reigned from 465 to 424 BC. This Artaxerxes was the third son of Xerxes and was raised to the throne by Artabanus, the murderer of Xerxes. Shortly after his accession, Artaxerxes put his older brother Darius to death; and a little later, Artabanus, who perhaps aimed to make himself king, was killed. Hystaspes, the second brother, who seems to have been satrap of Bactria at the time of his father&#x27;s death, rebelled, and after two battles was deprived of his power and probably of his life. The reign of Artaxerxes was further disturbed by the revolt of Egypt in 460 BC, and by that of Syria about 448 BC.The Egyptians were assisted by the Athenians, and their rebellion, led by Inarus and Amyrtaeus, was suppressed only after five years of strenuous exertions on the part of the Persians under the command of the great general Megabyzus. After the re-conquest of Egypt, Artaxerxes, fearing that the Athenians would make a permanent subjugation of Cyprus, concluded with them the peace of Callias, by which he retained the island of Cyprus; but agreed to grant freedom to all Greek cities of Asia Minor. Shortly after this Megabyzus led a revolt in Syria and compelled his sovereign to make peace with him on his own terms, and afterward lived and died in high favor with his humiliated king. Zopyrus, the son of Megabyzus at a later time, while satrap of Lycia and Caria, led a rebellion in which he was assisted by the Greeks. It is thought by some that the destruction of Jerusalem which is lamented by Nehemiah occurred during the rebellion of Syria under Megabyzus. Artaxerxes I died in 424 BC, and was succeeded by his son Xerxes II, and later by two other sons, Sogdianus and Ochus, the last of whom assumed the regnal name of Darius, whom the Greeks surnamed Nothus.(2) Ewald and others have thought that the Artaxerxes of Ezr 4:7 was the pseudo-Smerdis. The principal objection against this view is that we have no evidence that either the pseudo-Smerdis, or the real Smerdis, was ever called Artaxerxes. The real Smerdis is said to have been called Tanyoxares, or according to others Oropastes. Ewald would change the latter to Ortosastes, which closely resembles Artaxerxes, and it must be admitted that many of the Persian kings had two or more names. It seems more probable, however, that Artaxerxes I is the king referred to; and there is little doubt that the identification of the Artaxerxes of Ezr 4:7 with the pseudo-Smerdis would never have been thought of had it not been for the difficulty of explaining the reference to him in this place.(3) The Greek translation of the Septuagint renders the Ahasuerus of the Book of Esther by Artaxerxes, and is followed in this rendering by Jo...</p>

Maxima (Lugd. 1677), III, 429). He is mentioned in Titus 3:12 as one of the faithful companions of Paul. The name is probably Greek, a masculine form of Artemis, or, as has been suggested, a short form of Artemidorus, a common name in Asia Minor. These contracted forms were by no means rare in the Greek world. The Athenian orator, Lysias, was doubtless named after his grandfather, Lysanias, and at first may even have been called Lysanias himself.</p>

It was a barren rock covered with fortifications and houses several stories in height. The island was about 800 ft. long by 500 wide, surrounded by a massive wall, and an artificial harbor was constructed on the East toward the main land. It developed into a trading city in early times, as did most of the Phoenician cities on this coast. It had a powerful navy, and its ships are mentioned in the monuments of Egypt and Assyria. It seems to have had a sort of hegemony over the northern Phoenician cities, from Mt. Cassius to the northern limits of Lebanon, something like that of Sidon in the South. It had its own local dynasty and coinage, and some of the names of its kings have been recovered. Its inhabitants are mentioned in the early lists of Ge 10:18, and Eze 27:8,11 refers to its seamen and soldiers in the service of Tyre. It brought under its authority some of the neighboring cities on the main land, such as Marathus and Simyra, the former nearly opposite the island and the latter some miles to the South.Thothmes III, of Egypt, took it in his campaign in north Syria (1472 BC) and it is noticed in the campaigns of Rameses II in the early part of the 13th century BC (Breasted, Ancient Records). It is also mentioned in the Tell el-Amarna Lettersas being in league with the Amorites in their attacks upon the Egyptian possessions in Syria (44 and 28, B.M. Tell el-Amarna Letters). About the year 1200, or later, it was sacked by invaders from Asia Minor or the islands, as were most of the cities on the coast (Paton, Syria and Palestine, 145) but it recovered when they were driven back. Its maritime importance is indicated by the inscriptions of the Assyrian kings. Tiglath-pileser I (circa 1020) boasts that he sailed in the ships of Arvad. Asshur-nazir-pal (circa 876) made it tributary, but it revolted and we find 200 men of Arvad mentioned among the allies of Benhadad, of Damascus, at the great battle of Quarqar, when all Syria seems to have been in league against Shalmaneser II (circa 854). At this time the king of Arvad was Mattan Baal.It was afterward tributary to Tiglath-pileser III and Sennacherib, the king who paid it to the latter being Abd-ilihit (circa 701). Ashurbanipal (circa 664) compelled its king Yakinlu to submit and send one of his daughters to become a member of the royal harem (Rawlinson, Phoenicia, 456-57). Under the Persians Arvad was allowed to unite in a confederation with Sidon and Tyre, with a common council at Tripolis(ib 484). When Alexander the Great invaded Syria in 332 BC Arvad submitted without a struggle under her king Strato, who sent his navy to aid Alexander in the reduction of Tyre. It seems to have received the favor of the Seleucid kings of Syria and enjoyed the right of asylum for political refugees. It is mentioned in a rescript from Rome about 138 BC, in connecti...</p>

He was the son of Abijah and grandson of Rehoboam. Maacah, his mother, or rather grandmother, was daughter of Abishalom (Absalom) (1Ki 15:1 ff). The first ten years of his reign were prosperous and peaceful (2Ch 14:1). He introduced many reforms, such as putting away the sodomites or male prostitutes, removing idols from holy places, breaking down altars, pillars and Asherim. He even deposed the &quot;queen mother&quot; because of her idolatrous practices, and of the image which she had made for Asherah (1Ki 15:12 ff; 2Ch 14:3). Though the king himself, in the main, was a zealous reformer, his subjects did not always keep pace with him (1Ki 15:17). With an army of 580,000 he repelled an attack of Zerah, the Ethiopian, and routed him completely at Mareshah in the lowlands of Judah (2Ch 14:6 ff). Directed and encouraged by Azariah the prophet, he carried on a great revival. Having restored the great altar of burnt offering in the temple, he assembled the people for a renewal of their covenant with Yahweh. On this occasion 700 oxen and 7,000 sheep were offered in sacrifice.For the next twenty years there was apparently great prosperity and peace throughout his kingdom, but in the thirty-sixth year of his reign, Judah was attacked by Baasha, king of Israel, at all times hostile to Judah (1Ki 15:32). Baasha continued to encroach and finally fortified Ramah as a frontier fortress. Asa, faint-hearted, instead of putting his entire trust in Yahweh, made an alliance with Ben-hadad, of Damascus. The Syrian king, in consideration of a large sum of money and much treasure from the temple at Jerusalem, consented to attack the northern portion of Baasha&#x27;s territory. It was at this favorable moment that Asa captured Ramah, and with the vast building material collected there by Baasha, he built Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah (1Ki 15:16-22). This lack of faith in Yahweh was severely criticized by Hanani the prophet. Asa, instead of listening patiently to this prophet of God, was greatly offended and enraged and Hanani was put in prison (2Ch 16:1-10). Three years later, Asa was attacked by gout or some disease of the feet. Here again he is accused of lack of faith, for &quot;he sought not to Yahweh, but to the physicians&quot; (2Ch 16:12). Having ruled forty-one years, he died and was buried with great pomp in a tomb erected by himself in the city of David, i.e. Jerusalem. On the whole his reign was very successful, but it is sad to chronicle that as the years rolled on he became less and less faithful to Yahweh and His law.(2) A son of Elkanah, a Levite, who dwelt in one of the villages of the Netophathites (1Ch 9:16).W.

The three were sons of Zeruiah, one of David&#x27;s sisters (1Ch 2:15,16; 2Sa 2:18, etc.). The three brothers seem to have been from the beginning members of David&#x27;s troop of strangely respectable brigands. Asahel was distinguished for his swift running, and this fact brought misfortune upon him and upon Israel. When Abner and the forces of Ish-bosheth were defeated near Gibeon, Asahel pursued Abner. Abner knew that he could outright Asahel, though he could not outrun him. He also knew that the time had come for making David king, and that a blood feud among the leaders would be a calamity. He expostulated with Asahel, but in vain. It came to a fight, and Abner slew Asahel (2Sa 2:3). As a result the coming of David to the throne of all Israel was delayed; and when at last Abner brought it about, he himself was treacherously killed by Joab in alleged blood revenge for Asahel. Asahel is mentioned as sixth in the list of David&#x27;s &quot;mighty men&quot; (2Sa 23:24; 1Ch 11:26).The earlier of the names in this list are evidently arranged in the order of seniority. If it be assumed that the list was not made till after the death of Asahel, still there is no difficulty in the idea that some of the names in the list were placed there posthumously. Asahel is also mentioned as the fourth of David&#x27;s month-by-month captains (1Ch 27:7). Superficial criticism describes this position as that of &quot;commander of a division of David&#x27;s army,&quot; and regards the statement, &quot;and Zebadiah his son after him,&quot; as a note added to explain the otherwise incredible assertion of the text. This criticism is correct in its implication that the fourth captain was, as the text stands, the dead Asahel, in the person of his son Zebadiah. Coming from an annotator, the criticism regards this meaning as intelligible; is it any the less so if we regard it as coming from the author? In fact, the statement is both intelligible and credible. The second of David&#x27;s month-by-month captains is Dodai, the father of the second of David&#x27;s &quot;mighty men&quot;; and the fourth is Asahel, with his son Zebadiah. With these two variations the twelve month-by-month captains are twelve out of the nineteen seniors in the list of mighty men, and are mentioned in practically the same order of seniority. The 24,000 men each month were not a fighting army mobilized for war. The position of general for a month, whatever else it may have involved, was an honor held by a distinguished veteran. There is no absurdity in the idea that the honor may in some cases have been posthumous, the deceased being represented by his father or his son or by someone else.(2) A Levite member of the commission of captains and Levites and priests which Jehoshaphat, in his third year, sent among the cities of Judah, with the book of the law, to spread information among the people (2Ch 17:7-9).

In 1Ch 25:1 ff we are told that four of his sons were appointed to conduct under him detachments of the great chorus, the families of Heman and Jeduthun also furnishing leaders, and all took part at the dedication of the temple (2Ch 5:12).

If the translator mistook the waw (w) for beth (b) and read &#x27;en, he might have left the phrase untranslated because he supposed it to be the name of a place. Schurer disposes of the en by taking it as a corruption of segen = ceghen, which is equivalent to the Greek strategos (GVI, I, 197, note 17).H. J. Wolf</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-sen&#x27;-shun: Most modern Lives of Christ commence at Bethlehem and end with the Ascension, but Christ&#x27;s life began earlier and continued later. The Ascension is not only a great fact of the New Testament, but a great factor in the life of Christ and Christians, and no complete view of Jesus Christ is possible unless the Ascension its consequences are included. It is the consummation of His redemptive work. The Christ of the Gospels is the Christ of history, the Christ of the past, but the full New Testament picture of Christ is that of a living Christ, the Christ of heaven, the Christ of experience, the Christ of the present and the future. The New Testament passages referring to the Ascension need close study and their teaching careful observation.I. In the Gospels.1. Anticipations:The Ascension is alluded to in several passages in the Gospels in the course of our Lord&#x27;s earthly ministry (Lu 9:31,51; Joh 6:62; 7:33; 12:32; 14:12,28; 16:5,10,17,28; 20:17). These passages show that the event was constantly in view, and anticipated by our Lord. The Ascension is also clearly implied in the allusions to His coming to earth on clouds of heaven (Mt 24:30; 26:64).2. Records:If with most modern scholars we regard Mark&#x27;s Gospel as ending with 16:8, it will be seen to stop short at the resurrection, though the present ending speaks of Christ being received up into heaven, of His sitting at the right hand of God, and of His working with the disciples as they went preaching the word (Mr 16:19,20). In any case this is a bare summary only. The close of the Third Gospel includes an evident reference to the fact of the Ascension (Lu 24:28-53), even if the last six words of Lu 24:51, &quot;and was carried up into heaven&quot; are not authentic. No difficulty need be felt at the omission of the Fourth Gospel to refer to the fact of the Ascension, though it was universally accepted at the time the apostle wrote (Joh 20:17). As Dr. Hort has pointed out, &quot;The Ascension did not lie within the proper scope of the Gospels .... its true place was at the head of the Ac of the Apostles&quot; (quoted Swete, The Ascended Christ, 2).II. In the Acts.1. Record:The story in Ac 1:6-12 is clear. Jesus Christ was on the Mount of Olives. There had been conversation between Him and His disciples, and in the course of it He was taken up; and a cloud received Him out of their sight (Ac 1:9). His body was uplifted till it disappeared, and while they continued to gaze up they saw two men who assured them that He would come back exactly as He had gone up. The three Greek words rendered &quot;taken up&quot; (eperthe) (Ac 1:9); &quot;went&quot; (poreuomenou) (Ac 1:10); &quot;received up&quot; (analemphtheis) (Ac 1:11); deserve careful notice. This account must either be attributed to invention, or to the testimony of an eye-witness. But Luke&#x27;s historicity now seems abundantly proved.2. References:The Ascension is mentioned or implied in several passages in Ac 2:33 ff; 3:21; 7:55 f; 9:3-5; 22:6-8; 26:13-15. All these passages assert th...</p>

The last two consonants appear to represent the name of the Egyptian goddess Neith. The first part of the name will then represent either ns = &quot;belonging to&quot; (so Brugsch and generally), or &#x27;ws-n (note the doubled &quot;n&quot; in the Septuagint transcription) = &quot;she belongs to&quot; (so Spiegelberg). It is possible that these four letters represent the Egyptian name Sn-t (so Lieblein and others), though the &#x27;aleph (&#x27;) must then be explained as &#x27;aleph prostheticum and the taw (t) would be less regular than a he (h) to stand for the Egyptian feminine t.J.

It is a suggestion as old as Luther that the final letter &quot;n&quot;, was originally a &quot;z&quot;, and that the word should be &#x27;erez, &quot;cedar&quot;; the chief objection is that cedar occurs just before in the same verse. The word &#x27;oren seems to be connected with the Assyrian irin, meaning fir or cedar or allied tree. &quot;Fir&quot; has support from the Septuagint and from the rabbis. Post (HDB) suggests as probable the stone pine, Pinus pinea, which has been extensively planted round Beirut and unlike most planted trees flourishes without artificial watering--&quot;the rain doth nourish it.&quot;The translation &quot;ash&quot; was probably suggested by the fanciful resemblance of the Hebrew &#x27;oren and the Latin ornus, the manna ash of Europe. Three varieties of ash flourish in Syria, Fraxinus ornus, F. excelsior and F. oxycarpa. The last mentioned, which is common in parts of North Palestine, being a large tree some 30 to 40 ft. high, might suit the context were there anything philological to support the idea.E. W. G.

Often including also a sense of terror or fear because of the disgrace connected with the performance of some action. Capacity for shame indicates that moral sense (conscience) is not extinct. &quot;Ashamed&quot; occurs 96 out of 118 times in the Old Testament. Hebrew bosh, &quot;to feel shame&quot; (Latin, pudere), with derivatives occurs 80 times; kalam, &quot;to shame,&quot; including the thought of &quot;disgrace,&quot; &quot;reproach&quot;; chapher, &quot;to blush&quot;: hence shame because of frustrated plans (uniformly in the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;confounded&quot;); Greek aischunomai, &quot;suffused with shame,&quot; passive only and its compounds. Uses:(1) A few times, of actual embarrassment, as of Hazael before the steadfast look of Elisha (2Ki 8:11; see also 2Sa 10:5; 2Ki 2:17; Ezr 8:22).(2) Innocence not capable of shame: &quot;both naked .... and .... not ashamed&quot; (Ge 2:25; see SHAME); the redeemed no occasion for (Ps 34:5 the King James Version; 1Joh 2:28); Christ not of &quot;brethren&quot; (Heb 2:11); nor Christian of gospel (Ro 1:16); nor God of men of faith (Heb 11:16); nor they who trust in God (Isa 50:7; 54:4; Joe 2:26).(3) Sense of guilt: &quot;I am ashamed .... for our iniquities&quot; (Ezr 9:6); &quot;of thy lewd way&quot; (Eze 16:27,61); ascribed to idolaters chagrined at worthlessness of idols (Isa 1:29; 44:9,11; 45:16; Jer 2:26); to enemies (Ps 6:10); to wicked (Ps 31:17); to all who forsake God (Jer 17:13); to those who trust in human help, as Israel of Egypt and Assyria, and Moab of Chemosh (Jer 2:36; 48:13); to a mother of wicked children (Jer 50:12).(4) Repentance causes shame for sin (Jer 31:19; Ro 6:21).(5) Calamities also, and judgments (Jer 14:3,4; 15:9; 20:11).(6) Capacity for shame may be lost through long-continued sin (Jer 6:15; 8:12; compare Jer 3:3), exceptionally striking passages on the deadening power of immorality, suggestive of 1Ti 4:2; Titus 1:15.(7) The grace of Christ delivers from the shame of moral timidity (Ro 1:1; 2Ti 1:18,12,16;1Pe 4:16).(8) At Christ&#x27;s second coming His followers will &quot;not be ashamed before him&quot; (1Joh 2:28); at the final judgment He will be ashamed of all who have been ashamed of Him (Mr 8:38; Lu 9:26; compare Mt 10:33; Heb 11:16).(9) The word lends itself to rich poetic use, e.g. Lebanon, with faded and falling foliage, &quot;is ashamed&quot; (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;confounded&quot;) at the desolations of the land under Sennacherib (Isa 33:9); so great is God&#x27;s glory in the new Jerusalem that &quot;the sun (is) ashamed&quot; in His presence (Isa 24:23), explaining the glorious figure in Re 21:23; 22:5.

In 1Ch 7:6-11 (6) &quot;Jediael&quot; (&quot;known to God&quot;) is substituted for the heathen-sounding &quot;Ashbel&quot; (&quot;Ishbaal,&quot; &quot;man of Baal&quot;). The chronicler, in this case, conforms literally to the principle laid down in Ho 2:17; the title &quot;Baal&quot; (&quot;lord&quot;) was applied in early days (e.g. in the days of Saul) to the national God of Israel, but in later days the prophets objected to it because it was freely applied to heathen gods (compare ISH-BOSHETH).

The name means stronghold or fortress, and its strength may be inferred by the fact that Psammetik I, of Egypt, besieged it for many years (Herodotus says 29). Some of the Anakim were found there in the days of Joshua (Jos 11:22), and the inhabitants were too strong for the Israelites at that time. It was among the towns assigned to Judah, but was not occupied by her (Jos 13:3; 15:46,47). It was still independent in the days of Samuel, when, after the defeat of the Israelites, the ark was taken to the house of Dagon in Ashdod (1Sa 5:1,2). We have no account of its being occupied even by David, although he defeated the Philistines many times, and we have no definite knowledge of its coming into the hands of Judah until the time of Uzziah (2Ch 26:6).Ashdod, like the other Philistine towns, came under the authority of the Assyrian monarchs, and we have mention of it in their records. It revolted against Sargon in 711 BC, and deposed the Assyrian governor, Akhimiti, who had been appointed by him in 720. Sargon at once dispatched a force to subdue the rebels and the city was severely punished. This is referred to by Isaiah (Isa 20:1). Amos had prophesied such a calamity some years before (1:8), and Jeremiah refers to &quot;the remnant of Ashdod&quot; as though it had continued weak until his day (Jer 25:20). Zephaniah (Ze 2:4) refers to the desolation of Ashdod and Zechariah to its degraded condition (Zec 9:6). It continued to be inhabited, however, for we find the Jews intermarried with them after the return from Babylon (Ne 13:23,24). In the Maccabean period we are told that Judas and Jonathan both took it and purified it of idolatry (1 Macc 5:68; 10:84). In these passages it is called Azotus, as it is also in the New Testament (Ac 8:40). In the 4th century AD it became the seat of a bishopric. It had been restored in the time of Herod, by the Roman general Gabinius, and was presented to Salome, the sister of Herod, by the emperor Augustus. It is now a small village about 18 miles Northeast of Gaza.H. Porter</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ash&#x27;-er (&#x27;asher; Aser).1. Biblical Account:According to the Biblical account Asher was the eighth of Jacob&#x27;s sons, the second borne to him by Zilpah the handmaid of Leah. His uterine brother was Gad (Ge 35:26). With four sons and one daughter he went down into Egypt (Ge 46:17). At his birth Leah exclaimed, &quot;Happy am I! for the daughters will call me happy: and she called his name Asher,&quot; i.e. Happy (Ge 30:13). This foreshadowing of good fortune for him is repeated in the blessing of Jacob: &quot;His bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties&quot; (Ge 49:20); and again in that of Moses: &quot;Blessed be Asher with children; let him be acceptable unto his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil&quot; (De 33:24). His family prospered in Egypt, and at the Exodus the tribe of Asher is numbered at 41,500 adult males (Nu 1:41). At the second census the number is given 53,400 (Nu 26:47). The place of Asher in the desert march was with the standard of the camp of Dan, on the north of the tabernacle, along with Da and Naphtali; the prince of the tribe being Pagiel the son of Ochran (Nu 2:27 ff). Among the spies Asher was represented by Sethur (Nu 13:13). The tribe seems to have taken no important part in the subsequent history. It raised no hero, and gave no deliverer to the nation. In the time of David it was of so little consequence that the name is not found in the list of chief rulers (1Ch 27:16 ff). The rich land assigned to Asher sloped to the Phoenician seaboard, and brought him into touch with the Phoenicians who were already world-famous in trade and commerce. He probably soon became a partner in their profitable enterprises, and lost any desire he may ever have had to eject them from their cities (Jud 1:31). He cared not who ruled over him if he were free to pursue the ends of commerce. Zebulun might jeopard their lives unto the death, and Naphtali upon the high places of the field, to break the power of the foreign oppressor, but Asher &quot;sat still at the haven of the sea, and abode by his creeks&quot; (Jud 5:17 ff). He was probably soon largely absorbed by the people with whose interests his were so closely identified: nevertheless &quot;divers of Asher,&quot; moved by the appeal of Hezekiah, &quot;humbled themselves, and came to Jerus&quot; (2Ch 30:11 the King James Version). To this tribe belonged the prophetess Anna (Lu 2:36 ff).2. Modern Theory:According to a modern theory, the mention of the slave girl Zilpah as the mother of Asher is meant to indicate that the tribe was of mixed blood, and arose through the mingling of Israelites with the Canaanites. It is suggested that the name may have been taken from that of the Canaanite clan found in the Tell el-Amarna Letters, Mari abd-Ashirti, &quot;sons of the servant of Asherah.&quot; A similar name occurs in the inscriptions of the Egyptian Seti I (14th century BC), `Aseru, a state in western Galilee (W. Max Muller, As. und Eur., 236-39). This people it is thought may have associated themselves with the invaders from the wilderness. But...</p>

References to the Goddess2. Assyrian Origin of the Goddess3. Her Symbol4. The Attributes of the GoddessWas the name of a goddess whose worship was widely spread throughout Syria and Canaan; plural Asherim.1. References to the Goddess:Her &quot;image&quot; is mentioned in the Old Testament (1Ki 15:13; 2Ki 21:7; 2Ch 15:16), as well as her &quot;prophets&quot; (1Ki 18:19) and the vessels used in her service (2Ki 23:4). In Assyria the name appears under the two forms of Asratu and Asirtu; it was to Asratu that a monument found near Diarbekir was dedicated on behalf of Khammu-rabi (Amraphel) &quot;king of the Amorites,&quot; and the Amorite king of whom we hear so much in Tell el-Amarna Letters bears the name indifferently of EbedAsrati and Ebed-Asirti.2. Assyrian Origin of the Goddess:Like so much else in Canaanite religion, the name and worship of Asherah were borrowed from Assyria. She was the wife of the war- god Asir whose name was identified with that of the city of. Assur with the result that he became the national god of Assyria. Since Asirtu was merely the feminine form of Asir, &quot;the superintendent&quot; or &quot;leader,&quot; it is probable that it was originally an epithet of Ishtar (Ashtoreth) of Nineveh. In the West, however, Asherah and Ashtoreth came to be distinguished from one another, Asherah being exclusively the goddess of fertility, whereas Ashtoreth passed into a moon-goddess.3. Her Symbol:In Assyrian asirtu, which appears also under the forms asratu, esreti (plural) and asru, had the further signification of &quot;sanctuary.&quot; Originally Asirtu, the wife of Asir, and asirtu, &quot;sanctuary,&quot; seem to have had no connection with one another, but the identity in the pronunciation of the two words caused them to be identified in signification, and as the tree-trunk or cone of stone which symbolized Asherah was regarded as a Beth-el or &quot;house of the deity,&quot; wherein the goddess was immanent, the word Asirtu, Asherah, came to denote the symbol of the goddess. The trunk of the tree was often provided with branches, and assumed the form of the tree of life. It was as a trunk, however, that it was forbidden to be erected by the side of &quot;the altar of Yahweh&quot; (De 16:21; see Jud 6:25,28,30; 2Ki 23:6). Accordingly the symbol made for Asherah by his mother was &quot;cut down&quot; by Asa (1Ki 15:13). So, too, we hear of Asherim or symbols of the goddess being set up on the high places under the shade of a green tree (Jer 17:2; see 2Ki 17:10). Manasseh introduced one into the temple at Jerusalem (2Ki 21:3,7).4. The Attributes of the Goddess:Asherah was the goddess of fertility, and thus represented the Babylonian Ishtar in her character as goddess of love and not of war. In one of the cuneiform tablets found at Taanach by Dr. Sellin, and written by one Canaanite sheikh to another shortly before the Israelite invasion of Palestine, reference is made to &quot;the finger of Asherah&quot; from whic...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ash&#x27;-iz: Among the ancient Hebrews and other Orientals, to sprinkle with or sit in ashes was a mark or token of grief, humiliation, or penitence. Ashes on the head was one of the ordinary signs of mourning for the dead, as when &quot;Tamar put ashes on her head .... and went on crying&quot; (2Sa 13:19 the King James Version), and of national humiliation, as when the children of Israel were assembled under Nehemiah &quot;with fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth (ashes) upon them&quot; (Ne 9:1), and when the people of Nineveh repented in sackcloth and ashes at the preaching of Jonah (Jon 3:5,6; compare 1 Macc 3:47). The afflicted or penitent often sat in ashes (compare Job 2:8; 42:6: &quot;I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes&quot;), or even wallowed in ashes, as Jeremiah exhorted sinning Israel to do: &quot;O daughter of my people .... wallow thyself in ashes&quot; (Jer 6:26), or as Ezekiel in his lamentation for Tyre pictures her mariners as doing, crying bitterly and `casting up dust upon their heads&#x27; and `wallowing themselves in the ashes&#x27; (in their weeping for her whose head was lifted up and become corrupted because of her beauty), &quot;in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning&quot; (Eze 27:30,31). However, these and various other modes of expressing grief, repentance, and humiliation among the Hebrews, such as rending the garments, tearing the hair and the like, were not of Divine appointment, but were simply the natural outbursts of the impassioned oriental temperament, and are still customary among eastern peoples.Figurative: The term &quot;ashes&quot; is often used to signify worthlessness, insignificance or evanescence (Ge 18:27; Job 30:19). &quot;Proverbs of ashes,&quot; for instance, in Job 13:12, is Job&#x27;s equivalent, says one writer, for our modern &quot;rot.&quot; For the ritual use of the ashes of the Red Heifer by the priests, see RED HEIFER.George B.

The original meaning of the name is the &quot;man of Horus,&quot; Ashurites (ha-&#x27;ashuri). This name occurs in the list of Ish-bosheth&#x27;s subjects (2Sa 2:9).The Syriac, Arabic, and Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) versions read ha-geshuri, &quot;the Geshurites,&quot; designating the small kingdom to the South or Southeast of Damascus. This reading, though adopted by Ewald, Thenius and Wellhausen, is untenable, for during the reign of Ish-bosheth Geshur was ruled by its own king Talmai, whose daughter was married to David (2Sa 3:3; 13:37). Furthermore Geshur was too far away from the rest of Ishbosheth&#x27;s territory. A more consistent reading is ha- &#x27;asheri, as given in the Targum of Jonathan and accepted by Kohler, Klost, Kirkpatrick and Budde, &quot;those of the house of Asher&quot; (compare Jud 1:32). The term would, then, denote the country to the West of Jordan above Jezreel.Samuel Cohon</p>

The Ashkelonites are mentioned by Joshua (Jos 13:3), and the city was taken by the tribe of Judah (Jud 1:18). One of the golden tumors (the King James Version &quot;emerods&quot;) sent back with the ark by the Philistines was from Ashkelon (1Sa 6:17).David couples Ashkelon with Gath in his lament over Saul and Jonathan (2Sa 1:20) indicating its importance, and it is joined with Gaza, Ashdod and Ekron in the denunciations of Amos (1:7,8). It is referred to in a similar way by Jeremiah (Jer 25:20; 47:5,7). Zephaniah (2:4,7) speaks of the desolation of Ashkelon and Zechariah announces the fear of Ashkelon on the destruction of Tyre (9:5).The city is mentioned in the Tell el-Amarna Letters, and a certain Yitia is referred to as king. It revolted against Rameses II and was subdued, and we have mention of it as being under the rule of Assyria. Tiglath-pileser III names it among his tributaries, and its king, Mitinti, is said to have lost his reason when he heard of the fall of Damascus in 732 BC. It revolted in the reign of Sennacherib and was punished, and remained tributary to Assyria until the decay of that power. In Maccabean times we learn of its capture by Jonathan (1 Macc 10:86; 11:60, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;Ascalon&quot;). Herod the Great was born there (BJ, III, ii, 1 ff). In the 4th century AD it was the seat of a bishopric. It became subject to the Moslems in the 7th century and was taken by the Crusaders. It was taken in 1187 by Saladin, who dismantled it in 1191 to make it useless to Richard of England, into whose hands it was expected to fall. Richard restored it the next year but it was again destroyed by Saladin. It was an important fortress because of its vicinity to the trade route between Syria and Egypt.H. Porter</p>

Ashtaroth is the plural of ASHTORETH (which see). The name denotes a place associated with the worship of this goddess. Ashteroth-karnaim is mentioned only once in canonical Scripture unless we accept Gratz&#x27;s restoration, when Karnaim appears as a city taken by Israel: &quot;Have we not taken to us horns (qarnayim) by our own strength?&quot; (Am 6:13). It is identical with Carnion or Carnaim of 1 and 2 Macc, a city of Gilead with a temple of Atar-gatis. The name Ashtaroth has been identified with Astertu in the lists of Tahutmes III of the XVIIIth Egyptian Dynasty; and with Ashtarti of the Tell el-Amarna Letters. Its claim to antiquity is therefore well established.As far as the Biblical record is concerned, the names at the head of this article might stand for one and the same city, Ashtaroth being a contraction from Ashteroth-karnaim. But in the days of Eusebius and Jerome, we learn from the Onomasticon, there were two forts of this name 9 miles apart, lying between Adara (Der`ah) and Abila (Abil), while Ashtaroth, the ancient city of Og, king of Bashan, lay 6 miles from Adara. Carnaim Ashtaroth, which is evidently identical with Ashteroth-karnaim, they describe as a large village in the angle of Bashan where tradition places the home of Job. This seems to point to Tell `Ashtara, a hill which rises about 80 ft. above the plain, 2 miles South of el-Merkez, the seat of the governor of the Chauran. Three-quarters of a mile North of el-Merkez, at the south end of a ridge on which the village of Sheikh Ca&#x27;ad is built, stands the weley of the stone of Job, Weley Sakhret &#x27;Ayyub. By the large stone under the dome Job was said to have sat to receive his friends during his affliction.An Egyptian inscription, found by Schumacher, proves the stone to be a monument of the time of Rameses II. At the foot of the hill is pointed out the bath of Job. In el-Merkez the building known as Deir &#x27;Ayyub, &quot;Monastery of Job,&quot; is now part of the barracks. There is also shown the tomb of Job. The stream which flows southward past Tell `Ashtara, is called Moyet en-Neby &#x27;Ayyub, &quot;stream of the prophet Job,&quot; and is said to have risen where the patriarch stamped his foot on his recovery. It is to be noted also that the district lying in the angle formed by Nahr er-Raqqad and the Yarmuk River is called to this day ez-Zawiyet esh-sharqiyeh, &quot;the eastern angle&quot; (i.e. of the Jaulan). The term may in Jerome&#x27;s time have covered the land east of the `Allan, although this is now part of the Chauran. At Tell `Ashtara there are remains pointing to a high antiquity. The site was also occupied during the Middle A...</p>

Attributes of the Goddess3. Ashtoreth as a Moon-Goddess4. The Local Ashtaroth1. Name and Origin:The name of the supreme goddess of Canaan and the female counterpart of Baal.The name and cult of the goddess were derived from Babylonia, where Ishtar represented the evening and morning stars and was accordingly androgynous in origin. Under Semitic influence, however, she became solely female, but retained a memory of her primitive character by standing, alone among the Assyro-Bab goddesses, on a footing of equality with the male divinities. From Babylonia the worship of the goddess was carried to the Semites of the West, and in most instances the feminine suffix was attached to her name; where this was not the case the deity was regarded as a male. On the Moabite Stone, for example, `Ashtar is identified with Chemosh, and in the inscriptions of southern Arabia `Athtar is a god. On the other hand, in Atar-gatis or Derketo (2 Macc 12:26), Atar, without the feminine suffix, is identified with the goddess `Athah or `Athi (Greek Gatis). The cult of the Greek Aphrodite in Cyprus was borrowed from that of Ashtoreth; whether the Greek name also is a modification of Ashtoreth, as has often been maintained, is doubtful.2. Attributes of the Goddess:In Babylonia and Assyria Ishtar was the goddess of love and war. An old Babylonian legend related how the descent of Ishtar into Hades in search of her dead husband, Tammuz, was followed by the cessation of marriage and birth in both earth and heaven, while the temples of the goddess at Nineveh and Arbela, around which the two cities afterward grew up, were dedicated to her as the goddess of war. As such she appeared to one of Assur-bani-pal&#x27;s seers and encouraged the Assyrian king to march against Elam. The other goddesses of Babylonia, who were little more than reflections of the god, tended to merge into Ishtar who thus became a type of the female divinity, a personification of the productive principle in nature, and more especially the mother and creatress of mankind. The chief seat of the worship of Ishtar in Babylonia was Erech, where prostitution was practiced in her name, and she was served with immoral rites by bands of men and women. In Assyria, where the warlike side of the goddess was predominant, no such rites seem to have been practiced, and, instead, prophetesses were attached to her temples to whom she delivered oracles.3. Ashtoreth as a Moon-Goddess:In Canaan, Ashtoreth, as distinguished from the male `Ashtar, dropped her warlike attributes, but in contradistinction to Asherah, whose name and cult had also been imported from Assyria, became, on the one hand, the colorless consort of Baal, and on the other hand, a moon-goddess. In Babylonia the moon was a god, but after the rise of the solar theology, when the larger number of the Babylonian gods were resolved into forms of the sun-god, their wives also became sol...</p>

At the same time he proclaimed his son Shamash-shum-ukin as the crown prince of Babylonia. At the father&#x27;s death the latter, however, was only permitted to become viceroy of Babylonia.Ashurbanipal is generally believed to be the great and noble Osnappar (Ezr 4:10). See OSNAPPAR. If this identification should not prove correct, the king is not mentioned by name in the Old Testament. In the annals of Ashurbanipal there is a list of twenty tributary kings in which Manasseh (written Minse) of the land of Judah is mentioned. With a few exceptions the list is the same as that given by Esarhaddon, his father. In 2Ch 33:11 ff we learn that the captains of the host of the king of Assyria took Manasseh with hooks and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon. The king to whom reference is made in this passage was either Esarhaddon or Ashurbanipal. If the latter, his restoration of Manasseh was paralleled in the instance of Necho, the vassal king of Memphis and Sais, who also had revolted from Assyria; for he was accorded similar treatment, being sent back to Egypt with special marks of favor, and reinstated upon his throne.Another reference in the Old Testament, at least to one of the acts of Ashurbanipal, is the prophecy of Nahum, who in predicting the downfall of Nineveh, said, &quot;Art thou (Nineveh) better than No-amon?&quot; This passage is illustrated by the annals of the king, in which he recounts the destruction of the city. No (meaning &quot;city&quot;) is the name of Thebes, while Amon (or Amen) was the chief deity of that city.Esarhaddon died on his way to Egypt, which he had previously conquered, an insurrection having taken place. Tirhakah, whom Esarhaddon had vanquished, and who had fled to Ethiopia, had returned, and had advanced against the rulers appointed by Assyria. He formed a coalition with Necho and others. Not long after Ashurbanipal came to the throne, he set out for Egypt and defeated the forces. The leaders of the insurrection were carried to Nineveh in fetters. Necho, like Manasseh, as mentioned above, was restored to his rule at Sais. Tirhakah died shortly after. His sister&#x27;s son Tanut-Amon (Tandami) then took up the cause, and after the departure of the Assyrian army he advanced against the Assyrian vassal governors. The Assyrian army returned and relieved the besieged. Tanut- Amon returned to Thebes, which was conquered and which was spoiled by the rapacious Assyrians, 663 BC. This is what the prophet Nahum referred to (3:8). A few years later Psammetik, the son of Necho, who had remained faithful after his restoration, declared his independence. As the Assyrian army was required elsewhere, Egypt was henceforth free from the yoke of the Assyrian. Ba`al...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a&#x27;-shi-a (Asia): A Roman province embracing the greater part of western Asia Minor, including the older countries of Mysia, Lydia, Caria, and a part of Phrygia, also several of the independent coast cities, the Troad, and apparently the islands of Lesbos, Samos, Patmos, Cos and others near the Asia Minor coast (Ac 16:6; 19:10,27). It is exceedingly difficult to determine the exact boundaries of the several countries which later constituted the Roman province, for they seem to have been somewhat vague to the ancients themselves, and were constantly shifting; it is therefore impossible to trace the exact borders of the province of Asia. Its history previous to 133 BC coincides with that of Asia Minor of which it was a part. However, in that year, Attalus III (Philometer), king of Pergamos, bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman Empire. It was not until 129 BC that the province of Asia was really formed by Rome. Its first capital was Pergamos, the old capital of Mysia, but in the time of Augustus, when Asia had become the most wealthy province of the Empire, the seat of the government was transferred to Ephesus. Smyrna was also an important rival of Ephesus. The governor of Asia was a pro-consul, chosen by lot by the Roman senate from among the former consuls who had been out of office for at least five years, and he seldom continued in office for more than a single year. The diet of the province, composed of representatives from its various districts, met each year in the different cities. Over it presided the asiarch, whose duty it was, among other things, to offer sacrifices for the welfare of the emperor and his family.In 285 AD the province was reduced in size, as Caria, Lydia, Mysia and Phrygia were separated from it, and apart from the cities of the coast little remained. The history of Asia consists almost entirely of the history of its important cities, which were Adramyttium, Assos, Cnidus, Ephesus, Laodicea, Miletus, Pergamos, Philadelphia, Sardis, Smyrna, Thyatira, Troas, etc.E.

CHRISTIANITY IN ASIA MINORChristian Inscriptions, etc.LITERATUREIntroductory:Technically, it is only on sufferance that an account of &quot;Asia Minor&quot; can find a place in a Biblical encyclopedia, for the country to which this name applies in modern times was never so called in Old Testament or New Testament times. The term first appears in Orosius, a writer of the 5th century AD, and it is now applied in most European languages to the peninsula forming the western part of Asiatic Turkey.The justification for the inclusion in this work of a summary account of Asia Minor as a whole, its geography, history, and the social and political condition of its people in New Testament times, is to be found in the following sentence of Gibbon: &quot;The rich provinces that extend from the Euphrates to the Ionian Sea were the principal theater on which the Apostle to the Gentiles displayed his zeal and piety&quot;; and no region outside the city of Rome has preserved to modern times so many records of the growth and character of its primitive Christianity.I. The Country.1. Position and Boundaries:Asia Minor (as the country was called to distinguish it from the continent of Asia), or Anatolia, is the name given to the peninsula which reaches out between the Black Sea (Pontus Euxinus) on the North and the Mediterranean on the South, forming an elevated land-bridge between central Asia and southeastern Europe. On the Northwest corner, the peninsula is separated from Europe by the Bosporus, the Sea of Marmora and the hellespont. On the West the peninsula borders on the Aegean Sea, whose numerous islands tempted the timid mariner of ancient times on toward Greece. The West coast, with its alternation of mountain and river-valley, is deeply indented: there is a total coast line of four times the length of a line drawn from North to South The numerous land-locked bays and harbors of this coast have made it the happy hunting-ground of Mediterranean traders in all ages. On the East it is usual to delimit Asia Minor by a line drawn from Alexandretta to Samsun, but for the purposes of New Testament history it must be remembered that part of Cilicia, Cappadocia and Pontus (Galatia) lie to the East of this line (Longitude 26 degrees to 36 degrees East; latitude 36 degrees to 42 degrees North).2. General Description:There are two distinct countries, implying distinct historical development, in the Anatolian peninsula, the country of the coast, and the country of the central plateau. The latter takes its shape from that o...</p>

Views unquestioned only a few years ago are already passing out of date, while the modern archaeologist, enthusiastically excavating old sites, laboriously deciphering worn inscriptions, and patiently collating documentary evidence, has by no means completed his task. But it is now clear that an archaeological field, worthy to be compared with those in the valleys of the Euphrates and the Nile, invites development in Asia Minor.1. Earliest Influences from Mesopotamia:In the Contemporary Review for August, 1907, Professor Sayce reminded his readers that the Greek geographers called Cappadox the son of Ninyas, thereby tracing the origin of Cappadocian culture to Nineveh, and similarly they derived the Merm had Dynasty of Lydia from Ninos the son of Belos, or from Babylonia through Assyria. Actual history is probably at the back of these legends, and the Table of Nations supports this (Ge 10:22), when it calls Lud, or Lydia, a son of Shem and brother of Asshur. This is not to assert, however, that any great number of Semitic people ever made Asia Minor their home. But Professor Winckler and others have shown us that the language, script, ideas and institutions characteristic of the Babylonian civilization were widespread among the nations of western Asia, and from very early times Asia Minor came within their sphere of influence. Strabo records the tradition that Zile, as well as Tyana, was founded upon &quot;the mound of Semiramis,&quot; thus connecting these ancient sites with the Mesopotamian culture.Dr. David Robinson in his Ancient Sinope (145 ff), argues that &quot;the early foundations of Sinope are probably Assyrian,&quot; though established history cannot describe in detail what lay back of the Milesian settlement of this the northern point and the best harbor of the peninsula. Neither could Strabo go back of the Milesian colonists for the foundation of Samsoun, the ancient Amisus, an important commercial city east of Sinope, but the accompanying illustration (Fig. 1) seems clearly to show the influence of Assyria. The original is a terra cotta figure of gray clay found recently in Old Samsoun. Mesopotamian religious and cultural influences thus appear to have tinged Asia Minor, at least at certain points, as far as the coast of the Black Sea, and indeed the great peninsula has been what its shape suggests, a friendly hand stretching out from the continent of Asia toward the continent of Europe.2. Third Millennium BC:Professor Sayce&#x27;s article referred to above was based upon the evidence furnished by cuneiform tablets from Kara Eyuk, the &quot;Black Mound,&quot; an ancient site just within the ox-bows of the Halys River near Caesarea Mazaca. These tablets, as deciphered by himself and Professor Pinches, were of the period of Abraham, or of Hammurabi, about 2250 BC, and were written in a dialect of Assyrian. The settlers...</p>

What their exact functions were is not altogether clear. They derived their appellation from the name of the province over which they presided (compare BITHYNIARCH; CARIARCH; SYRIARCH).Brandis has shown that they were not &quot;high priests of Asia,&quot; as some have thought, but delegates of individual cities to the provincial Council (Commune Asioe; see ASIA MINOR) which regulated the worship of Rome and of the emperor. They were probably assembled at Ephesus, among other places, to preside over the public games and the religious rites at the festival, in honor of the gods and the emperor, when they sent word to Paul and gave him a bit of friendly advice, not to present himself at theater (me dounai heauton eis to theatron, Ac 19:31). The title could be held along with any civil office and with the high-priesthood of a particular city. They served for one year, but re-election was possible (the tenure of office, according to Ramsay, was four years). The municipalities must have shown the Asiarchs high honor, as we find the names of many perpetuated on coins and inscriptions. The office could only be held by men of wealth, as the expenses of the provincial games were for the greater part defrayed by the Asiarchs.LITERATURE.CI, 2511, 2912; CIL, 296, 297; Brandis, Pauly-Wissowa&#x27;s Real-Encyclopedia, articles &quot;Archiereus&quot; and &quot;Asiarches&quot;; Strabo, XIV, 649; Eusebius, HE, IV, 15; Hicks, Ancient Greek Inscrs in the British Museum; Ramsay, Classical Review, III, 174 ff; Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia, I, 55-58, and II, chapter xi; Guiraud, Les assemblees provinciales de l&#x27;Empire Romain; Lightfoot, Ignatius and Polycarp, II, 987 ff.M.

It does not imply any inferiority on the part of the person asking (Ps 2:8). It is the Son who is bidden to ask, and therefore the word expresses the request of an equal. It has also the meaning &quot;to inquire&quot;: &quot;Wherefore .... ask after my name?&quot; (Ge 32:29) signifying, &quot;Surely you must know who I am.&quot; &quot;Ye shall ask me no question&quot; (Joh 16:23), i.e. &quot;about the true meaning of My words, for all will then be clear to you&quot; (Dummelow). aiteo, is the word commonly used with reference to prayer. It means &quot;to ask,&quot; &quot;to implore,&quot; and presents the petitioner as an inferior asking from a superior (Mt 6:8; 7:7,8; Mr 10:35; Joh 14:13, and in many other places). It is not, however, asking in the sense of the word beg, but rather that of a child making request of its father. The petitioner asks both because of his need and of the assurance that he is welcome. He is assured before he asks that the petition will be granted, if he asks in accordance with God&#x27;s will (1 Joh 3:22; 5:15). Moreover the Spirit leads us to such asking in that He reveals our need and the goodness of God to us. See AMISS; PRAYER.Jacob W. Kapp</p>

In the presence of death no truth has been so sustaining to Christian faith as this. It is the distinct product of Christ&#x27;s resurrection. Paul speaks of departed believers as having &quot;fallen asleep in Christ&quot; (1Co 15:6,18); as proof of the soul&#x27;s immortality he terms the risen Christ &quot;the first- fruits of them that are asleep.&quot; Lazarus and Stephen, at death, are said to have &quot;fallen asleep&quot; (Joh 11:11; Ac 7:60); so of David and the ancient patriarchs (Ac 13:36; 2Pe 3:4). The most beautiful description of death in human language and literature is Paul&#x27;s characterization of the dead as &quot;them also which sleep in Jesus&quot; (1Th 4:14 the King James Version). This blessed hope has wrought itself permanently into the life and creed and hymnology of the Christian church, as in the hymn often used with such comforting effect at the burial service of believers: &quot;Asleep in Jesus! blessed sleep!&quot;Dwight M.

Older etymologists derived the name from the Hebrew verb shamadh, &quot;destroy&quot;; but it is now generally held to be associated with Zoroastrianism, with which the Jews became acquainted during the exile, and by which later Jewish views on the spirit-world were greatly influenced. It is now held to be the equivalent of the Persian Aeshma-Deva, the spirit of concupiscence. The spirit is at times reckoned as the equal in power of &quot;Abaddon&quot; (Job 31:12) and of &quot;Apollyon&quot; (Re 9:11), and in Tobit is represented as loving Sara, only daughter of Raguel of Ecbatana, and as causing the death on the bridal night of seven husbands who had in succession married her. His power was broken by the young Tobias acting on the advice of the angel Raphael (Tobit 6:15). He burnt on the &quot;ashes of incense&quot; the heart and liver of a fish which he caught in the Tigris. &quot;But when the devil smelled the smell, he fled into the uppermost parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him&quot; (Tobit 8:3).

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">as-mo-ne&#x27;-ans: A remarkable priestly family of Modin, in Judea, also called Hasmoneans or Maccabees. They belonged to that portion of the Jewish nation which under all trials and temptations remained loyal to Yahweh, even when the national life and religion seemed at their lowest ebb, and they succeeded, for a while at least, in restoring the name and fame of Israel. All in all they were an extremely warlike family. But the entire Asmonean history affords abundant proof of the bitter partisanships which, even more than the persecutions of their enemies, sapped the national strength and divided the nation into bitterly hostile factions.The Asmoneans never, in all their history, or at any given period in it, had a united people behind their backs. They had to fight disloyalty at home, as well as deadly enmity abroad. A considerable portion of the people was unable to withstand the paganizing influence of the Macedonian and Syrian periods, and in this direction the thousands of Hebrew soldiers, who fought under the Greek banners, must have exerted an inestimable influence. The Asmonean struggle is therefore, in all its phases, a three-sided one, and it makes the ascendancy of the family all the more remarkable. The sources of our knowledge of this period are mainly found in the Books of the Macc, in the Josephus, Antiquities and Josephus, Jewish Wars of Josephus, and in occasional references of Strabo, Livy and other classic historians.The contents of Josephus, Antiquities plainly prove that Josephus used the Books of the Macc as far as possible, but that besides he was possessed of sources of information now wholly lost. The name &quot;Asmonean&quot; is derived from the Hebrew Chashman, &quot;wealthy.&quot; Chashman was a priest of the family Joarib (Ant., XII, vi, 1; 1 Macc 2:1; 1Ch 24:7). The name &quot;Maccabee,&quot; from the surname of Judas, the son of Mattathias, may be derived from the Hebrew maqqdbhah, &quot;a hammer&quot;; makhbi, &quot;an extinguisher&quot;; or from the first letters of the Hebrew sentence, Mi Khamokhah Ba-&#x27;elim YHWH? &quot;Who among the gods, O Lord, can be likened unto thee,&quot; inscribed on the Maccabean banner in the word Makhbiy.1. The Asmonean Revolt:Antiochus Epiphanes returned in 169 BC from the Egyptian wars, the fruits of which had been wrested from him by the Roman power, which a year later, in his fourth war, in the person of Pompilius Laenas, was to order him peremptorily to leave Egypt once and for all time. Thus his four campaigns against his hereditary foe were made utterly barren. Grave suspicions had been aroused in the king&#x27;s heart against the Jews, and when their wrangling about the high-priesthood afforded him an opportunity, he resolved forever to crush the power of Judaism and to wipe out its detested religion. Thus Apollonius (Josephus tells us, the king himself, BJ, V, ix, 4) in 168 BC appeared before Jerusalem, devastated the city, defiled the temple by the sacrifice of swine on the altar of burnt offering, destroyed all the holy writings that could be...</p>

Most authors have supposed the Egyptian cobra (Naia haje, L.) to be the snake meant, but while this is widely distributed throughout Africa, its occurrence in Southern Palestine seems to rest solely on the authority of Canon Tristram, who did not collect it.There are Other poisonous snakes in Palestine, any one of which would satisfy the requirements of these passages. See SERPENT. While the aspis of classical Greek literature may well have been the Egyptian cobra, it is to be noted that Vipera aspis, L., is confined to central and western Europe.Alfred Ely Day</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">as (chamowr or chamor, compare Arabic chamar, apparently connected with Arabic root &#x27;achmar, &quot;red,&quot; but referred by some to root hamal, &quot;to carry&quot;; also, but less commonly, both in Hebrew and in Arabic, &#x27;athon, Arabic &#x27;atan, used in Arabic only of the females; pereh, or pere&#x27;, and `aradh, or `arodh, Arabic &#x27;ard, &quot;wild ass,&quot; and also `ayir, Arabic `air, &quot;a young&quot; or &quot;wild ass&quot;).1. Names:The name `arodh (Job 39:5) is rare; onos (Mt 21:2).2. Meaning:(1) Chamor is derived from the root which means, in all probability, &quot;to carry a burden&quot; (see Furst, Handworterbuch, ch-m-r ii), or &quot;heap up.&quot; While no analogies are contained in the Old Testament this root occurs in New Hebrew. The Aramaic chamer, means &quot;to make a ruin-heap&quot; (from which the noun chamor, &quot;a heap,&quot; used in Jud 15:16 in a play of words: &quot;With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of an ass have I smitten a thousand men&quot;). The root may also mean &quot;to be red.&quot; In this case the nominal form chamor may have been derived from the reddish-brown skin of a certain type of the ass.(2) &#x27;Athon, Assyrian &#x27;atanu and Aramaic &#x27;atana&#x27;, is derived from &#x27;atha&#x27; &quot;to come,&quot; &quot;go,&quot; etc. (Furst suggests that it may be derived from &#x27;athan, Aramaic `adhan, &quot;to be slender,&quot; &quot;docile,&quot; etc.); &#x27;athonoth tsechoroth, &quot;red-white asses&quot; (Jud 5:10) designates a better breed.(3) `Ayir, Arabic `airu (&quot;male ass&quot;) used of the young and vigorous animal, is derived from the root `-y-r, &quot;to go away,&quot; &quot;escape through swiftness&quot; (Hommel, Namen der Saugethiere, 121-23). This name is used as a parallel to beni &#x27;athono (Ge 49:11) and as a compound of `ayir pere&#x27; (Job 11:12), &quot;a wild ass&#x27;s colt.&quot;(4) Pere&#x27;, &quot;wild ass,&quot; is derived from the root which means &quot;to run,&quot; suggestive of the animal&#x27;s swiftness.  (5) `Arodh, is, in all probability, an Aramaic loan-word for the Hebrew pere&#x27;. The Targum uses `arodha&#x27; and `aradha&#x27;.3. Uses:From the references to these various names in the Old Testament it is clear that(1) chamor was used for riding purposes:(a) by men (2Sa 16:2,23; 19:26; 1Ki 2:40; 13:13,23,24,27);(b) by women (Ex 4:20; Jos 15:18; Jud 1:14; 1Sa 25:20,23,42; compare 2Ch 28:15). tsemedh chamorim, &quot;a pair of asses&quot; was used for riding as well as for burdens (Jud 19:3,10,19,21, etc.).(2) It was also used in tillage (Isa 32:20). In this connection the law prohibits the use of an ass in plowing with an ox (De 22:10). The she-ass (&#x27;athon) was used as a beast of burden (Ge 45:23) and for riding (Jud 5:10; Nu 22:21,22; 2Ki 4:24). The &#x27;ayir is also referred to as used in riding (Jud 10:4), carrying (Isa 30:6) and tilling (Isa. 30:24).4. As a Domestic Animal:Besides the use of the ass in agriculture and riding it was employed in the caravans of commerce, and sent even upon long expeditions through the desert. The ass is and always has been one of the most common domestic animals. It is a much more important animal in Bible lands than in England and America. The humblest peasant owned his own ass.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-sas-i-na&#x27;-shun.1. Meaning of the Term:The language of Scripture distinguishes less clearly than the modern juridical between assassination and murder. &quot;Murderer&quot; = rotseach (Nu 35:16-19,21,30,31; 2Ki 6:32; Job 24:14); horegh, from haragh = &quot;to slay,&quot; &quot;kill,&quot; the King James Version translation &quot;murderer&quot; in Ho 9:13; but &quot;slayer&quot; in Eze 21:11. Where the Revised Version (British and American) renders &quot;slayers,&quot; we find ratsach, in Nu 35:11,25-28; De 4:42; 19:3,4,6; Jos 20:3,5,6; 21:13,21,27,32,38, irrespective of whether willful, deliberate killing is spoken of, or hasty or merely accidental; and nakhah = &quot;to strike,&quot; &quot;wound,&quot; &quot;kill,&quot; &quot;slay,&quot; in Nu 35:24. The prohibition against killing is all-inclusive, even to suicide, placing the ban not only on deliberate, purposeful slaying (Ex 21:12,14,18), but on all endangering of life through negligence (De 22:8) or recklessness (Le 19:14) or hatred, anger and revengefulness (Le 19:17 ff).2. Punishment of the Act:The Mosaic law presupposes the punishment of all killing of human beings on the ground of Ge 9:6, and repeatedly reiterates it (Ex 21:12,14 ff; Le 24:17,21; Nu 35:33; De 19:11 ff), the reason assigned being that man is made in the image of God; hence to slay a man is paramount to lifting the hand against the Creator. And while the degrees of guilt are not indicated by the language, they are closely distinguished by the punishments prescribed. Not only notorious enmity against the slain and deliberate lying-in-wait on the part of the murderer (Ex 21:13; Nu 35:20 ff; De 19:4,11), but also the nature of the instrument was taken into account to determine the nature of the crime (Nu 35:16 ff).

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-sas&#x27;-inz (sicarioi; the King James Version murderers): Josephus (BJ, II, xiii, 3, xvii) relates that &quot;there sprang up in Jerusalem a class of robbers called Sicarii, who slew men in the daytime, and in the midst of the city. This they did chiefly when they mingled with the populace at the festivals, and, hiding short daggers in their garments, stabbed with them those that were their enemies. The first to be assassinated by them was Jonathan the high priest, and after him many were slain daily&quot; (see also Ant, XX, viii, 6, ix). The name is derived from Latin sica, &quot;a dagger.&quot; The sicarioi were implacable in their hatred to Rome and to those Jews who were suspected of leaning toward Rome. They took a leading part in the Jewish rebellion and in the disturbance previous to it, and also in the faction quarrels during the war. After the war they continued their nefarious practices in Egypt and Cyrene whither they had fled. Lysias mistook Paul for `the Egyptian who .... led out into the wilderness the 4,000 men of the sicarioi&#x27; (Ac 21:38).S. F. Hunter</p>

The Greek word horme used of an attack upon persons in Ac 14:5 (the King James Version) is rendered &quot;onset&quot; in the Revised Version (British and American).

The Hebrew word ya&#x27;al (1Sa 17:39) is used of David clad in Saul&#x27;s armor, who &quot;assayed,&quot; that is, &quot;tried unsuccessfully,&quot; to go and attack Goliath in it, for &quot;he had not proved it,&quot; where nacah is the verb. In De 4:34 and Job 4:2 nacah is rendered &quot;assay,&quot; in the sense of &quot;attempt,&quot; &quot;venture.&quot; In Ac 16:7 Paul is said to have &quot;assayed,&quot; that is, &quot;attempted&quot; (but was hindered), to go into Bithynia, and now in Ac 24:6 Paul is charged with having &quot;assayed,&quot; that is, &quot;having had the audacity,&quot; to profane the temple, where peirazein is the verb used in both cases. In Ac 9:26, and now in the Revised Version (British and American) Ac 26:21, &quot;assay,&quot; renders the verb peirasthai, &quot;to attempt,&quot; in both cases unsuccessfully. In Heb 11:29 it translates two Greek words peiran lambanein &quot;to make an attempt unsuccessfully.&quot;T. Nicol.</p>

This has been variously interpreted. Tyler translates &quot;editors of collections.&quot; Klienert renders &quot;protectors of the treasure- chambers,&quot; &#x27;acuppoth being considered equivalent to the &#x27;acuppim of 1Ch 26:15,17; Ne 12:25 (see ASUPPIM). The proverbs are like nails guarding the sacred storehouse, the book closing with this warning against touching the collection (compare Re 22:18,19). Delitzsch translates &quot;like fastened nails which are put together in collections.&quot; &quot;As ba`ale berith (Ge 14:13) signifies `the confederates,&#x27; ba`ale shebhu`ah (Ne 6:18) `the sworn,&#x27; and the frequently occurring ba`ale ha-`ir `the citizens&#x27;: so ba`ale &#x27;acuppoth means, the possessors of assemblies and of the assembled themselves, or the possessors of collections and of things collected. Thus ba`ale &#x27;acuppoth will be a designation of the `words of the wise&#x27; (as in shalishim, &quot;choice men&quot; = choice proverbs, Pr 22:20, in a certain measure personified), as of those which form or constitute collections and which stand together in order and rank&quot; (&quot;Eccl,&quot; English translation, 434).The Jerusalem Talmud takes &#x27;acuppoth as the Sanhedrin. On the whole it is better to interpret the phrase &quot;persons skilled in collections&quot; of wise sayings, grouped in a compact whole (compare Wright, Eccl, 102).S. F. Hunter</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-sem&#x27;-bli (qahal; ekklesia): The common term for a meeting of the people called together by a crier. It has reference therefore to any gathering of the people called for any purpose whatsoever (Ex 12:6; Ps 22:16 the King James Version; Ps 89:7 the King James Version; Ac 19:32,41). The solemn assemblies of the Jews were their feasts or religious gatherings of any kind (Isa 1:13). The word paneguris, &quot;a general festal assembly&quot; (Heb 12:23), is transferred from the congregation of the people of Israel to the Christian church of which the congregation of Israel was a figure. In the same passage, ekklesia has the sense of calling, summoning. In classical Greek ekklesia was the name for the body of free citizens summoned by a herald. In this sense the church calls all the world to become identified with it. It denotes the whole body of believers, all who are called. Or it may refer to a particular congregation or local church (sunagoge, &quot;synagogue&quot; Jas 2:2 the Revised Version, margin). See CALLING; CHURCH; CONGREGATION.Jacob W. Kapp</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-ses&#x27;-er: Lit. one who sits by another, an assistant; among the ancients especially an assistant to the king (compare &quot;The assessor of his throne,&quot; Dryden, Milton&#x27;s P.L., Book vi), or to the judge (see Dryden, Virgil&#x27;s Aeneid, vi.583). Later it came to mean one who assesses people or property for purposes of taxation.(1) Royal officials in Israel have the general title sarim, &quot;princes,&quot; and this general title included the officer who was &quot;over the tribute,&quot; who seems to have had charge of the assessment, as well as the collection of taxes. In the days of the later monarchy &quot;the governor of the royal household,&quot; &quot;the royal steward and high chamberlain,&quot; seems to have held some such important position (Isa 22:15; 36:3,22).(2) The early kings do not seem to have subjected the people to heavy taxes, but we find much in the prophets about the injustice and extortion practiced by these officials on the poor of the land (compare Am 2:6,7; Isa 5:8; Jer 5:28; Mic 3:11). Special taxes seem to have been imposed to meet emergencies (compare 2Ki 23:35), but it is not clear that anything of the nature of a regular land tax, or property tax, existed in early times; though something of the kind may be referred to in the reward promised by Saul to the slayer of Goliath (1Sa 17:25) and the tenth mentioned in 1Sa 8:15-17. The kings of Judah, it would seem, made free use of the temple treasures.(3) Later the Roman government &quot;farmed out&quot; the taxes of the provinces. The publicans, or tax-gatherers of the Gospels, seem to have been agents of the imperial procurator of Judea, instead of direct agents of the great Roman financial companies, who ordinarily let out the business of the collection of the taxes to officers of their own.During the Empire there was ample imperial machinery provided for the regular collection of the taxes, and the emperor appointed a procurator in each province whose business it was to supervise the collection of revenue. Some Jews found the business profitable, but these were objects of detestation to their countrymen. See PUBLICAN.George B. Eager</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">as&#x27;-os (Assos): An ancient city of Mysia in the Roman province of Asia, at which, according to Ac 20:13, Paul and Luke rested while on their way from Troas to Mitylene. Standing upon a conical-shaped rock on the southern coast of the Troad, it occupied one of the finest sites in Asia. The rock is about 700 ft. high; its sides are covered with terraces, both natural and artificial, and so steep is it that Stratoricus wrote of it: &quot;If you wish to hasten your death, try and climb Assos.&quot; The view from the summit is extensive and magnificent.The city, which is very ancient, is said to have been rounded by the Aeolians, and to have always been singularly Greek. As early as the 5th century BC it struck its own coins, and its coinage system continued until 235 AD. One of its early rulers or tyrants was Hermeas, a eunuch, once a slave, who gave his niece in marriage to Aristotle. There the great Greek philosopher lived three years, from 348 to 345 BC. During the time of the kings of Pergamus, the city bore the name of Apollonia. To the Byzantines it was known as Machramion, and at present the town, which has dwindled in importance under Turkish rule, is called Bekhram, a Turkish corruption of the Byzantine name.The ruins of Assos are among the most imposing in Asia Minor, and yet they have long served as a quarry; from its public buildings the stones for the Constantinople docks were taken. The Turkish sultan Murad II presented the many beautiful bas-reliefs of the Doric temple of Athene to the French government, which are now preserved in the Louvre. The ruins were carefully explored and partially excavated in 1882-83 by Mr. Clarke for the Archaeological Institute of America, and the entire plan of the ancient city is clear. Upon the very summit of the hill stood the temple of Athena which is said to have been erected about 470 BC. Among its ruins Clarke found eight other bas-reliefs which are now in the Boston Museum and which possess a special interest because of their connection between the art of the Orient and of Greece.Upon the several natural terraces of the hill which have been enlarged by artificial means, stood the many public buildings, as the gymnasium, the public treasury, the baths, the market place and theater, of which but little now remains. The city was surrounded by a double wall which in places is still well preserved. The inner wall of dressed stones laid without mortar, and filled with loose stones, is 8 ft. thick, and the larger outer wall was protected with towers at intervals of 60 ft. The ancient road leading to Troas was well paved. The harbor from which Paul sailed has now been filled up and is covered with gardens, but at its side is the modern harbor protected by an artificial mole, about which are clustered the few houses bearing the name of Bekhram. Upon the summit of the hill, by the ruins of the temple, are cisterns, a Turkish fortress and a Byzantine church which has been converted into a mosque. Without the city walls...</p>

It signifies the joyous, unwavering confidence of an intelligent faith; the security of a fearless trust. The original words have to do with the heart of vital religion. baTach, &quot;trust&quot;; &#x27;aman, &quot;to prop,&quot; &quot;to support,&quot; hence to confide in, to trust. Jesus repeatedly used this word &quot;amen&quot; to express the trustworthiness and abiding certainty of his sayings. pistis, &quot;faith&quot;; plerophoria, &quot;full assurance.&quot; The confidence of faith is based, not on &quot;works of righteousness which we have done&quot; (compare Titus 3:4,5 the King James Version) but on the highpriesthood and atoning sacrifice of Christ.(Heb 10:21,22; compare He 10:19, &quot;boldness to enter .... by the blood of Jesus,&quot; the King James Version). Assurance is the soul&#x27;s apprehension of its complete emancipation from the power of evil and from consequent judgment, through the atoning grace of Christ. It is the exact opposite of self-confidence, being a joyous appropriation and experience of the fullness of Christ--a glad sense of security, freedom and eternal life in Him. This doctrine is of immeasurable importance to the life of the church and of the individual believer, as a life of spiritual doubt and uncertainty contradicts the ideal of liberty in Christ Jesus which is the natural and necessary fruitage of &quot;the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit .... shed on us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour.&quot; Paul unhesitatingly said, &quot;I know&quot; (2Ti 1:12)--a word which, oft-repeated in 1 Jn, furnishes the groundwork of glad assurance that runs through the entire epistle.

The Older Empire3. The Second Empire4. Last Period and Fall of EmpireLITERATUREAssyria, a Greek name formed from Asshur (&#x27;ashshur; &#x27;Assour; Assyrian Assur): The primitive capital of the country.I. Geography.The origin of the city (now Kala&#x27;at Shergat), which was built on the western bank of the Tigris between the Upper and Lower Zab, went back to pre-Sem times, and the meaning of the name was forgotten (see Ge 2:14, where the Hiddekel or Tigris is said to flow on the eastern side of Asshur). To the North of the junction of the Tigris and Upper Zab, and opposite the modern Mossul, was a shrine of the goddess Ishtar, around which grew up the town of Nina, Ninua or Nineveh (now Kouyunjik and Nebi Yunus). Another early sanctuary of Ishtar was at Urbillu, Arbailu or Arbela, East of the Upper Zab. North of Nineveh was Dur-Sargina (now Khorsabad) where Sargon built his palace (720 BC). All this district was embraced in the kingdom of Assyria which extended from Babylonia northward to the Kurdish mountains and at times included the country westward to the Euphrates and the Khabur.II. Early History.The whole region was known to the early Babylonians as Subartu. Its possession was disputed between Semitic Amurru or AMORITES (which see) and a non-Semitic people from the North called Mitannians. The earlier high priests of Assur known to us bear Mitannian names. About 2500 BC the country was occupied by Babylonian Semites, who brought with them the religion, law, customs, script and Semitic language of Babylonia (Ge 10:11,12, where we should read &quot;He went forth to Asshur&quot;; see Mic 5:6). The foundation of Nineveh, Rehoboth-&#x27;Ir (Assyrian Rebit-Ali, &quot;the suburbs of the city&quot;), Calah and Resen (Assyrian Res- eni, &quot;head of the spring&quot;) is ascribed to them. The triangle formed by the Tigris and Zab, which enclosed these cities, was in later times included within the fortifications of the &quot;great city&quot; (Ge 10:12; Jon 3:3). Assyria is always distinguished from Babylonia in the Old Testament, and not confounded with it as by Herodotus and other classical writers.III. Climate and Productions.Assyria, speaking generally, was a limestone plateau with a temperate climate, cold and wet in winter, but warm during the summer months. On the banks of the rivers there was abundant cultivation, besides pasture-land. The apple of the North grew by the side of the palm-tree of the South. Figs, olives, pomegranates, almonds, mulberries and vines were also cultivated as well as all kinds of grain. Cotton is mentioned by Sennacherib (King, PSBA, December, 1909). The forests were tenanted by lions, and the plains by wild bulls (rimi, Hebrew re&#x27;emim), wild asses, wild goats and gazelles. Horses were i...</p>

The personality, teaching and works of Jesus were so wonderful, Divine, supernatural, as to awaken emotions of surprise and awe never before known in the presence of man.The people &quot;were astonished out of measure&quot; at His doctrine (Mr 10:26 the King James Version); &quot;astonished with a great astonishment&quot; at His raising the dead (Mr 5:42 the King James Version).

Origin of Modern Astrology3. &quot;Curious Arts&quot; of EphesusLITERATUREI. The Desire to Forecast the Future.The desire to penetrate the future and influence its events has shown itself in all lands and ages. But it is clear that a knowledge of the future does not lie within the scope of man&#x27;s natural powers; &quot;divination&quot; therefore has always been an attempt to gain the help of beings possessing knowledge and power transcending those of man. The answer of the Chaldeans to King Nebuchadnezzar when he demanded that they should tell his dream was a reasonable one: &quot;There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king&#x27;s matter: .... there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh&quot; (Da 2:10,11). &quot;Divination,&quot; therefore, in all its forms is but an aspect of polytheism.It was for the twofold reason that the arts of divination were abominable in themselves, and gave to their votaries no knowledge of the will of God, that such arts were forbidden in the Law (De 18:9-15). Israel was to be perfect with God and He would reveal to them His will perfectly through that prophet like unto Moses whom He would send. Keil and Delitzsch in commenting on this passage well remark: &quot;Moses groups together all the words which the language contained for the different modes of exploring the future and discovering the will of God, for the purpose of forbidding every description of soothsaying, and places the prohibition of Molochworship at the head, to show the inward connection between soothsaying and idolatry, possibly because februation, or passing children through the fire in the worship of Moloch, was more intimately connected with soothsaying and magic than any other description of idolatry&quot; (Commentary on the Pentateuch, III, 393).1. Methods of Soothsaying:The forms of soothsaying mentioned in this catalogue are as follows: &quot;One that practiceth augury&quot; (me`onen) is of uncertain etymology, but the tabbins connect it with `ayin, &quot;an eye&quot;; literally therefore one who ogles, or who bewitches with the evil eye. &quot;An enchanter&quot; (menachesh), sometimes supposed to be a snakecharmer, is probably one who fascinates like a snake; in other words a mesmerist or hypnotist. The word occurs in connection with Joseph&#x27;s divining-cup, and such cups were employed both in Babylon and Egypt, and their use was akin to the more modern crys...</p>

And the son of man, that thou visitest him? For thou hast made him but little lower than God, And crownest him with glory and honor. Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet&quot; (Ps 8:3-6).  The heavenly bodies were inexpressibly glorious, and they were all the handiwork of Yahweh--without power or vitality of their own--and man, not by any inherent virtue, but by the will and grace of God, was superior to them in importance. Thus there was a great gulf fixed between the superstitions of the heathen who worshipped the sun, moon and stars as gods, and the faith of the pious Hebrew who regarded them as things made and moved by the will of one only God. And it followed from this difference that the Hebrew, beyond all nations of like antiquity, was filled with a keen delight in natural objects and phenomena, and was attentively observant of them.I. The Heavenly Bodies.1. The Ordinances of Heaven:To the sacred writers, the ordinances of heaven taught the lesson of Order--great, magnificent and immutable.

The daughter of Astyages (Mandane) married a Persian, Cambyses, and a son was born to them who later became Cyrus the Great. Astyages had given orders to expose the babe; but Harpagus, on whom the task had been imposed, gave the child to a herdsman, with instructions to kill him. When the boy, who had been brought up as his own by the herdsman, arrived at the age of twelve, Astyages discovered that he was the son of Mandane. The king in wrath then had the son of Harpagus killed and served to his father as food. The latter concealed his feelings of hatred and resentment, and bided his time; and when the young Cyrus had grown to manhood, he stirred up the grandson in insurrection against Astyages, who was defeated and taken prisoner (Herodotus i.127-30). When Astyages marched against the Persians, the Medes, under the command of Harpagus, deserted their king, and sided with the disappointed Persians; and Cyrus was crowned king. This account of Herodotus is confirmed by the Annalistic Tablet of Cyrus (RP, series ii, 159). The dethroned monarch was treated with kindness by his conqueror. According to Ktesias, a home was provided for him by Cyrus in Hyrcania.Astyages was the last of the kings of the Manda (Media). An exceedingly shrewd man, Deioces by name, had founded the kingdom 150 years before (699-646). Phraortes was the second in line (646-624), and Cyaxares the third (624-584).J. E. Harry</p>

In ancient Israel we meet with it in two forms--the asylum of the altar and the asylum of the cities of refuge. The altar at the House of God was a place to which persons in danger fled for protection (1Ki 1:50; 2:28). It had horns and must not be confused with the altars of earth or stone that were used for lay sacrifices. See ALTAR; SANCTUARY. Ex 21:14 provides that a murderer is to be taken from the altar to be put to death. The law of the cities of refuge proceeds upon a somewhat different principle. Its objects are(1) to shield a homicide from the avenger of blood until trial, and(2) to provide a refuge for the manslayer who has not been guilty of murder. There is one reference to the institution in the history of the kingdom (2Sa 14:14). For the legal and geographical information, see CITIES OF REFUGE; HOMICIDE.Harold M. Wiener</p>

Ashtoreth) is identified with the goddess `Atah, whose name is sometimes written `Ati. or `Atah or `Ati was also worshipped at Palmyra, and (according to Melito) in Adiabene.The compound Atargatis, often corrupted by the Greeks into Derketo, had her chief temples at Membij (Hierapolis) and Ashkelon where she was represented with the body of a woman and the tail of a fish, fish being sacred to her. Herodotus made her the Aphrodite Urania of the Greeks. `Ati may have been originally a Hittite goddess with whom the Assyrian Ishtar (`Atar) came afterward to be identified tory of the kingdom (2Sa 14:14).

Relationship:(1) Daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, grand-daughter of Omri, 6th king of Israel. In her childhood the political relations of the two kingdoms of Judah and Israel had, after many years of strife, become friendly, and she was married to Jehoram, eldest son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah (2Ki 8:18). The marriage was one of political expediency, and is a blot on the memory of Jehoshaphat.2. Athaliah as Queen:When Jehoram was 32 years of age, he succeeded to the throne, and Athaliah became queen of Judah. She inherited her mother&#x27;s strength of will, and like her developed a fanatical devotion to the cult of the Zidonian Baal. Elijah&#x27;s blow at the worship of Baal in Samaria shortly before her accession to power did nothing to mitigate her zeal. It probably intensified it. The first recorded act of Jehoram&#x27;s reign is the murder of his six younger brothers; some princes of the realm, who were known to be favorable to the ancient faith of the nation, were also destroyed (2Ch 21:4). There can be little doubt that these deeds of blood were supported, and perhaps instigated, by Athaliah, who was a much stronger character than her husband.3. Murder of Her Grandchildren:After eight years of royal life, Athaliah became a widow, and her son, Ahaziah, then 22 years of age (2Ki 8:26; not 42 as in 2Ch 22:2), ascended his father&#x27;s throne. As queen-mother, Athaliah was now supreme in the councils of the nation, as well as in the royal palace. Within a single year, the young king fell (see JEHU), and the only persons who stood between Athaliah and the throne were her grandchildren. It is in such moments that ambition, fired by fanaticism, sees its opportunity, and the massacre of the royal seed was determined on. This was carried out: but one of them, Jehoash, a babe, escaped by the intervention of his aunt, Jehosheba (1Ki 11:2; 2Ch 22:11).4. Her Usurpation:The palace being cleared of its royal occupants, Athaliah had herself proclaimed sovereign. No other woman, before or since, sat upon the throne of David, and it is a proof of her energy and ability that, in spite of her sex, she was able to keep it for six years. From 2Ch 24:7 we gather that a portion of the temple of Yahweh was pulled down, and the material used in the structure of a temple of Baal.5. The Counter-Revolution:The high priest at this time was Jehoiada, who had married the daughter of Athaliah, Jehosheba (2Ch 22:11). His promotion to the primacy led to the undoing of the usurper, as Jehoiada proved staunchly, if secretly, true to the religion of Yahweh. For six years he and his wife concealed in their apartments, near the temple, the young child of Ahaziah. In the seventh year a counter-revolution was planned. The details are given with unusual fullness in Ki and Chronicles, the writings of which supplement one another. Thus, when the Chronicler wrote, it had become safe to give the ...</p>

But it seems better that we should consider it under four heads, in order to obtain a clear idea of the different meanings in which it has been used.(1) The classical.In this sense it does not mean a denial of the existence of a Divine Being, but the denial of the existence or reality of the god of a particular nation. Thus the Christians were repeatedly charged with atheism, because of their disbelief in the gods of heathenism. It was not charged that they did not believe in any god, but that they denied the existence and reality of the gods worshipped, and before whom the nation hitherto had bowed. This was considered so great a crime, so dangerous a thing to the nation, that it was felt to be a just cause for most cruel and determined persecutions. Socrates&#x27; teaching cast a shadow on the reality of the existence of the gods, and this charge was brought against him by his contemporaries. Cicero also uses the word in this sense in his charge against Diagoras of Athens. Indeed, such use of it is common in all classical literature.(2) Philosophic.It is not meant that the various philosophic systems to which this term is applied actually deny the existence of a Divine Being or of a First Cause, but that they are atheistic in their teaching, and tend to unsettle the faith of mankind in the existence of God. There is indeed a belief in a first cause, in force, in motion, in a certain aggregation of materials producing life, but the Divine Being as taught by theism is absolutely denied. This is true of the Idealism of Fichte, of the Ideal Pantheism of Spinoza, the Natural Pantheism of Schelling, and similar forms of thought. In applying the word atheism to the teaching here given, theism does not intend to assail them as wholly without a belief in a Divine Being; but it affirms that God is a person, a self- conscious Being, not merely a first cause or force. To deny this fundamental affirmation of theism is to make the teaching atheistic, a denial of that which is essential to theism (Heb 11:3).(3) Dogmatic.It absolutely denies the existence of God. It has often been held that this is, in fact, impossible. Cousin has said, &quot;It is impossible, because the existence of God is implied in every assertion.&quot; It is true, however, that in all ages there have been persons who declared themselves absolute atheists. Especially is this true of the 18th century a period of widespread skepticism--when not a few, particularly in France, professed themselves atheists. In many cases, however, it resulted from a loose use of the word, careless definition, and sometimes from the spirit of boastfulness.(4) Practical atheism.It has nothing at all to do with belief. Indeed it accepts the affirmations of theism. It has reference wholly to the mode of life. It is to live as though there was no God.It takes t...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ath&#x27;-enz Athenai In antiquity the celebrated metropolis of Attica, now the capital of Greece. Two long walls, 250 ft. apart, connected the city with the harbor (Peiraeus). In Ac 17 we are told what Paul did during his single sojourn in this famous city. He came up from the sea by the new road (North of the ancient) along which were altars of unknown gods, entered the city from the West, and passed by the Ceramicus (burial-ground), which can be seen to this day, the &quot;Theseum,&quot; the best preserved of all Greek temples, and on to the Agora (Market-Place), just North of the Acropolis, a steep hill, 200 ft. high, in the center of the city. Cimon began and Pericles completed the work of transforming this citadel into a sanctuary for the patron goddess of the city.The magnificent gateway (Propylaea), of which the Athenians were justly proud, was built by Mnesicles (437-432 BC). A monumental bronze statue by Phidias stood on the left, as one emerged on the plateau, and the mighty Parthenon a little further on, to the right. In this temple was the famous gold and ivory statue of Athena. The eastern pediment contained sculptures representing the birth of the goddess (Elgin Marbles, now in the British Museum), the western depicting her contest with Poseidon for supremacy over Attica. This, the most celebrated edifice, architecturally, in all history, was partially destroyed by the Venetians in 1687. Other temples on the Acropolis are the Erechtheum and the &quot;Wingless Victory.&quot; In the city the streets were exceedingly narrow and crooked. The wider avenues were called plateiai, whence English &quot;place,&quot; Spanish &quot;plaza.&quot; The roofs of the houses were flat. In and around the Agora were many porticoes stoai. In the Stoa Poecile (&quot;Painted Portico&quot;), whose walls were covered with historical paintings, Paul met with the successors of Zeno, the Stoics, with whom he disputed daily. In this vicinity also was the Senate Chamber for the Council of Five Hundred, and the Court of the Areopagus, whither Socrates came in 399 BC to face his accusers, and where Paul, five centuries later, preached to the Athenians &quot;the unknown God.&quot; In this neighborhood also were the Tower of the Winds and the water-clock, which must have attracted Paul&#x27;s attention, as they attract our attention today.The apostle disputed in the synagogue with the Jews (Ac 17:17), and a slab found at the foot of Mount Hymettus (a range to the East of the city, 3,000 ft. high), with the inscription haute he pule tou kuriou, dikaioi eiseleusontai en aute (Ps 118:20), was once thought to indicate the site, but is now believed to date from the 3rd or 4th century. Slabs bearing Jewish inscriptions have been found in the city itself.The population of Athens was at least a quarter of a million. The oldest inhabitants were Pelasgians. Cecrops, the first traditional king, came from Egypt in 1556 BC, and by marrying the daughter of Actaeon, obtained the sovereignty. The first king was Erechtheus. Theseus united the twelve c...</p>

            <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.7;font-size:0.9rem;margin:0;">The concept of atonement in Scripture is far richer than the penal substitution model most Western churches teach. The Hebrew &lsquo;kaphar&rsquo; means &ldquo;to cover&rdquo; and the sacrificial system pointed to restoration of relationship, not appeasement of an angry God.

Mt 5:24; lip- rarely (Da 9:24).I. Terms Employed.1. Hebrew and Greek Words:The root meanings of the Hebrew words, taking them in the order cited above, are, to &quot;cover,&quot; hence expiate, condone, cancel, placate; to &quot;offer,&quot; or &quot;receive a sin offering,&quot; hence, make atonement, appease, propitiate; &quot;effect reconciliation,&quot; i. e. by some conduct, or course of action. Of the Greek words the meanings, in order, are &quot;to be,&quot; or &quot;cause to be, friendly&quot;; &quot;to render other,&quot; hence to restore; &quot;to leave&quot; and with preposition to leave off, i. e. enmity, or evil, etc. ; &quot;to render holy,&quot; &quot;to set apart for&quot;; hence, of the Deity, to appropriate or accept for Himself.2. The English Word:It is obvious that the English word &quot;atonement&quot; does not correspond etymologically with any Hebrew or Greek word which it translates. Furthermore, the Greek words in both Septuagint and New Testament do not correspond exactly to the Hebrew words; especially is it true that the root idea of the most frequently employed Hebrew word, &quot;cover,&quot; is not found in any of the Greek words employed. These remarks apply to both verbs and substantives The English word is derived from the phrase &quot;at one,&quot; and signifies, etymologically, harmony of relationship or unity of life, etc. It is a rare instance of an AS theological term; and, like all purely English terms employed in theology, takes its meaning, not from its origin, but from theological content of the thinking of the Continental and Latin-speaking Schoolmen who employed such English terms as seemed most nearly to convey to the hearers and readers their ideas. Not only was no effort made to convey the original Hebrew and Greek meanings by means of English words, but no effort was made toward uniformity in translating of Hebrew and Greek words by their English equivalents.3. Not to Be Settled by Lexicon Merely:It is at once clear that no mere word-study can determine the Bible teaching concerning atonement. Even when first employed for expressing Hebrew and Christian thought, these terms, like all other religious terms, already had a content that had grown up with their use, and it is by no means easy to tell how far heathen conceptions might be imported into our theology by a rigidly etymological study of terms employed. In any case such a study could only yield a dictionary of terms, whereas what we seek is a body of teaching, a circle of ideas, whatever words and phrases, or combinations of words and phrases, have been employed to express the teaching.4. Not Chiefly a Study in Theology:There is even greater danger of making the study of the Atonement a study in dogmatic theology. The frequent employment of the expression &quot;the Atonement&quot; shows this tendency. ...</p>

Named:In addition to the chief passage, Le 16, which is treated under a separate head, we have the following:In Ex 30:10 it is mentioned in the directions that are given for the construction of the altar of incense that Aaron, once a year, is to make an atonement on the horns of the altar, with the blood of the sin offering, which is used for the purpose of an atonement for sin.In Le 23:26-32 mention is made in the list of festivals of the Day of Atonement, on the 10th day of the 7th month. It is ordered that for this day there shall be a holy convocation at the sanctuary, a fast, an offering by fire, and rest from labor from the 9th day of the 7th month in the evening.According to Le 25:9 the year of jubilee begins with the Day of Atonement.Nu 18 speaks of the duties and the rights of the priests and the Levites. In contrast with the latter, according to 18:7, Aaron and his sons are to perform the duties of the priesthood in all matters pertaining to the altar and of the service within the veil and shall render this service. We have here doubtless a comprehensive law for the entire priestly order, so that from this alone it cannot be determined that the service within the veil, by which reference is made to the ceremony of the Day of Atonement, has been reserved for the high priest alone, just as in De 10:8; 33:8 ff, everything that pertains to the whole tribe of Levi is found combined, without thereby the division into high priest, priests and Levites, being regarded as excluded (compare EZEKIEL, II, 2, (1), c).Nu 29:7-11 contains in connection with the laws treating of sacrifices also the enactment, that on the 10th day of the 7th month there shall take place a holy convocation at the sanctuary, fasting and rest from labor. In addition to the sin offering, which is brought for the purpose of atonement for sin, and in addition to the regular burnt offerings and the accompanying meal offerings and drink offerings, burnt offerings also are to be brought, namely, one young bullock, one young ram, seven lambs of the first year (all without blemish); then meal offerings, namely, three-tenths (compare Nu 28:12-14) of fine flour mingled with oil for each bullock; two-tenths for each ram; one-tenth for each lamb; then a sin offering, namely, one he-goat.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">at-a-li&#x27;-a Attalia: A city on the southern coast of Asia Minor in ancient Pamphylia which, according to Ac 14:25, was visited by Paul and Barnabas on the way to Antioch during their first missionary journey. The city was founded by Attalus II Philadelphus (159-138 BC), hence, its name Attalia, which during the Middle Ages was corrupted to Satalia; its modern name is Adalia. Attalia stood on a flat terrace of limestone, about 120 ft. high, near the point where the Catarrhactes River flowed into the sea. The river now, however, has practically disappeared, for the greater part of its water is turned into the fields for irrigation purposes. The early city did not enjoy the ecclesiastical importance of the neighboring city of Perga; but in 1084 when Perga declined, Attalia became a metropolis. In 1148 the troops of Louis IV sailed from there to Syria; in 1214 the Seljuks restored the city walls, and erected several public buildings. The city continued to be the chief port for ships from Syria and Egypt, and the point of entry to the interior until modern times, when the harbor at Mersine was reopened; it has now become a place of little importance.The town possesses considerable which is of archaeological interest. The outer harbor was protected by ancient walls and towers now in ruins; its entrance was closed with a chain. The inner harbor was but a recess in the cliff. The city was surrounded by two walls which were constructed at various times from material taken from the ruins of the ancient city; the outer wall was protected by a moat. The modern town, lying partly within and partly without the walls is thus divided into quarters. In the southern quarter live the Christians; in the northern the Moslems. Among other objects of archaeological interest still to be seen may be mentioned the inscribed arched gateway of Hadrian and the aqueduct. Rich gardens now surround the town; the chief exports are grain, cotton, licorice root and valonia or acorn-cups.E. J. Banks</p>

These passages show how diversely and elastically the term &quot;attire&quot; was used among the Hebrews. The numerous synonyms for &quot;dress,&quot; &quot;attire,&quot; &quot;apparel,&quot; &quot;clothes,&quot; &quot;raiment,&quot; &quot;garment,&quot; etc., found in English Versions of the Bible, reflect a similar wealth of nomenclature in the original Hebrew and Greek; but the lack of exactness and consistency in the renderings of translators makes the identification of the various articles of dress referred to very difficult, sometimes impossible.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">at&#x27;-i-tuds: Customs change slowly in Bible lands. This becomes clear by a comparison of the many references found in the Bible and other literatures of the Orient with existing circumstances and conditions. The same fact is attested by the pictures illustrating daily life upon the monuments of Assyria, Babylonia and Egypt in the countries between the Nile and the Tigris. Many of these, dating back to the second or third millennium before our era, prove conclusively that the same practices and usages as are now common among the inhabitants of those lands were in vogue in the days of Hammurabi and the early rulers of Egypt. This is especially true of matters pertaining to the worship of the gods, and of the attitudes or positions assumed in homage and respect to monarchs and those in authority.The many references found in the Bible to these same usages prove that the Hebrews too had much in common with the nations around them, not only in creed, but also in the mode of worship, as well as in general everyday etiquette. This is not strange, at least among the Semitic peoples, for there is more or less agreement, even among all nations, ancient and modern, in the attitude of the worshipper in temple and high place.The outward tokens of respect and honor shown by Orientals to their superiors, above all to monarchs, may seem exaggerated. But when we consider that the king was God&#x27;s vicegerent upon the earth or over a certain country, and in some sense Divine, worthy even of adoration, it is not strange that almost equal homage should be paid him as the gods themselves. The higher the person was in power, the greater the honor and respect shown him. It is natural, therefore, that God, the Lord of Lords, and the King of Kings should be the recipient of the highest reverence and adoration.There are several Hebrew words used to describe the various attitudes assumed by those who worshipped Yahweh and heathen gods; these same words are constantly employed in speaking of the homage or respect paid to rulers and persons in authority. The most common terms are those rendered &quot;to stand,&quot; &quot;to bow,&quot; &quot;to kneel&quot; and &quot;prostrate oneself&quot; or &quot;fall on the face.&quot; It is not always easy to differentiate between them, for often one passes imperceptibly into the other. No doubt several attitudes were assumed by the worshipper or suppliant while offering a prayer or petition. The intensity, the ardor or earnestness with which such a petition or prayer was presented would naturally have much to do with the words and posture of the petitioner, though the same expression might be employed to designate his posture or attitude. Thus &quot;to fall on the face&quot; might be done in many different ways. The Moslems observe a regular course of nine or more different postures in their worship. These are more or less faithfully observed by the faithful everywhere. It is almost certain that the Hebrews in common with other Orientals observed and went through almost every one of these attitudes a...</p>

See under DIVINATION.The English Versions of the Bible make this noun the name of a place; but no such place is known and the derivation and form of the word are clear and certain. We have a similar phrase similarly misunderstood by our translators in Ge 12:6 where the &quot;oak of Moreh&quot; should be &quot;the oak&quot; (or &quot;terebinth?&quot;) &quot;of the diviner&quot; or &quot;augur,&quot; for moreh is also a part. = &quot;one who teaches&quot; or &quot;directs.&quot; Probably the same tree is meant, since in each ease the neighborhood is that of Shechem. The worship of trees, or rather the deity supposed to make them his home, has prevailed very widely. See W. R. Smith, Rel. Semitic. (2), 195; compare Jud 4:5; 2Sa 5:24 and &quot;the oak of Zeus at Dodona. &quot; In Jud 9:6 we read of a &quot;matstsebhah, oak tree&quot;: the tree with an altar on which sacrifices were offered. The oak trees of Ge 12:6 and of Jud 9:37, if two distinct trees are meant, would be trees which the Canaanites had been in the habit of consulting: hence, the name.T. Witton Davies</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">o&#x27;-gu-ri o&#x27;-gur-i: This word occurs in the Revised Version (British and American) in Le 19:26; De 18:10,14; 2Ki 21:6, and the parallel in 2Ch 33:6. In all these cases the verb &quot;practice augury&quot; is in the King James Version &quot;to observe times.&quot; The verb thus translated is `onen, which means probably to utter a low croaking sound as was done in divining. See DIVINATION.I. Definition.The derivation of &quot;augur&quot; is doubtful, but that it means strictly to divine from the flight of birds is suggested by its likeliest etymology (avis, gur) and especially from the fact that in early Latin the augur was called auspex ( = avi spex). But both words came to be applied to all forms of divining from omens.II. Augury among the Romans.The Roman augur was a government official, paid to guide the councils of the nation in times of peace and of war. The principal signs from which these augurs deduced their omens were these:(1) celestial signs, chiefly lightning and thunder, the direction of the former (right to left a good sign, and vice versa);(2) signs from the flight, cries and feeding of birds;(3) signs from the movements and audible sounds of animals, including serpents;(4) signs from the examination of the entrails of animals;(5) belomancy, or divination by arrows;(6) sortilege, or divination by lot. Among the Romans as among other nations (Babylonians, etc.), a sacrifice was offered before omens were taken, so as to propitiate the gods.III. Augury among the Greeks.Almost the only kind of divination practiced or even known among the Romans was that by signs or omens, though Cicero (de Div. i.1 f) notices another kind which may be called divining by direct inspiration from the gods. It is this higher and more spiritual mode of divining that obtained most largely among the Greeks, whose chief word for diviner implies this. Yet the lower kind of divination known as augury was to some extent practiced among the Greeks.IV. Augury among the Hebrews.In general it may be said that the religion of Israel set itself steadfastly and consistently against augury; a very remarkable fact when one remembers how rife it was among the surrounding peoples--Arabs, Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptians, etc. Surely there is in this evidence of special Divine guidance, for those ancient Hebrews are not fit to be compared with the Babylonians or Egyptians or Romans for achievements in art and general secular literature. For the attitude of the Old Testament toward augury see the passages enumerated in the opening of this article. Several kinds of augury are mentioned in the Old Testament, and in some eases without explicit condemnation.1. Belomancy:Belomancy was a method of divination by arrows, a number of which were marked in certain ways, then mixed and drawn at random. We have a reference to this in Ho 4:12: `My people ask counsel from their wood [literally, &quot;tree&quot;] and their staff [i. e. &quot;arrow&quot;] tells them (their oracles)&#x27;; and also in Eze 21:21: `For the king of Babylon .... used d...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">o-gus&#x27;-tus Augoustos:(1) The first Roman emperor, and noteworthy in Bible history as the emperor in whose reign the Incarnation took place (Lu 2:1). His original name was Caius Octavius Caepias and he was born in 63 BC, the year of Cicero&#x27;s consulship. He was the grand-nephew of Julius Caesar, his mother Atia having been the daughter of Julia, Caesar&#x27;s younger sister. He was only 19 years of age when Caesar was murdered in the Senate house (44 BC), but with a true instinct of statesmanship he steered his course through the intrigues and dangers of the closing years of the republic, and after the battle of Actium was left without a rival. Some difficulty was experienced in finding a name that would exactly define the position of the new ruler of the state. He himself declined the names of rex and dictator, and in 27 BC he was by the decree of the Senate styled Augustus. The epithet implied respect and veneration beyond what is bestowed on human things:  &quot;Sancta vocant augusta patres: augusta vocantur Templa sacerdotum rite dicata manu.&quot; --Ovid Fasti. 609; compare Dion Cass., 5316The Greeks rendered the word by Sebastos, literally, &quot;reverend&#x27;&quot; (Ac 25:21,25). The name was connected by the Romans with augur--&quot;one consecrated by religion&quot;--and also with the verb augere. In this way it came to form one of the German imperial titles &quot;Mehrer des Reichs&quot; (extender of the empire). The length of the reign of Augustus, extending as it did over 44 years from the battle of Actium (31 BC) to his death (14 AD), doubtless contributed much to the settlement and consolidation of the new regime after the troubled times of the civil wars.It is chiefly through the connection of Judea and Palestine with the Roman Empire that Augustus comes in contact with early Christianity, or rather with the political and religious life of the Jewish people at the time of the birth of Christ: &quot;Now it came to pass in those days, there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be enrolled&quot; (Lu 2:1). During the reign of Herod the Great the government of Palestine was conducted practically without interference from Rome except, of course, as regarded the exaction of the tribute; but on the death of that astute and capable ruler (4 BC) none of his three sons among whom his kingdom was divided showed the capacity of their father.In the year 6 AD the intervention of Augustus was invited by the Jews themselves to provide a remedy for the incapacity of their ruler, Archelaus, who was deposed by the emperor from the rule of Judea; at the same time, while Caesarea was still the center of the Roman administration, a small Roman garrison was stationed permanently in Jerusalem. The city, however, was left to the control of the Jewish Sanhedrin with complete judicial and executive authority except that the death sentence required confirmation by the Roman procurator. There is no reason to believe that Augustus entertained any specially favorable appreciation of Judaism, but ...</p>

The fear resident in a guilty conscience sees only sternness and severity in God&#x27;s perfect righteousness. The word may be made an eminent study in the psychology of an evil heart. Wrongdoing eclipses the soul&#x27;s vision of God&#x27;s love and pictures His righteousness as harsh, unfeeling, partial, unjust, forbidding. The awfulness of sin may thus be seen in its power so to pervert the soul as to make goodness seem evil, justice unjust, and even love unlovely. Compare &quot;hard&quot; skleros, &quot;dried up,&quot; &quot;harsh&quot; in the parable of the Talents (Mt 25:24).Dwight M. Pratt</p>

It is rendered &quot;author&quot; in the following passages:(a) Heb 12:2, &quot;looking unto Jesus, the author [King James Version, Revised Version] and finisher [Revised Version, &quot;perfecter&quot;] of our faith.&quot; But here it seems better to take archegos in its primary sense, &quot;leader&quot; (Revised Version margin &quot;captain&quot;), rather than in its secondary sense &quot;author.&quot; The meaning is, not that He is the originator of faith in us, but that He Himself is the pioneer in the life of faith. He is first in the company of the faithful (compare references to His &quot;faithfulness,&quot; Heb 2:17; 3:2,5,6), far surpassing in His fidelity even the Old Testament saints mentioned in chapter 11; and therefore we are to look to Him as our perfect pattern of faith. Faith has not only Christ for its object, but Christ for its supreme example. So Bengel, Bleek, B. Weiss, Alford, A. B. Davidson, Grimm-Thayer. Others, however, take the word in the sense of &quot;author.&quot;(b) Heb 2:10, &quot;to make the author [King James Version, &quot;captain&quot;] of their salvation perfect through sufferings.&quot; Here the idea of Christ as originator or author of our salvation is present (compare the passage Heb 5:9, where however a different word is used; see above). But here again the original meaning of &quot;leader&quot; is not to be lost sight of. He, being the first possessor of salvation, becomes the author of it for others. &quot;The idea that the Son goes before the saved in the same path ought perhaps to be retained&quot; (Davidson). Compare Heb 6:20, where Jesus is said to be our &quot;forerunner.&quot;(c) Ac 3:15, King James Version margin and the Revised Version margin have &quot;author,&quot; where text has &quot;prince.&quot; Here again it is possible that the two ideas are present.D.

Internal AuthorityLITERATUREI. General Idea.1. Of Two Kinds:The term is of manifold and ambiguous meaning. The various ideas of authority fall into two main classes: as external or public tribunal or standard, which therefore in the nature of the case can only apply to the outward expressions of religion; and as immanent principle which governs the most secret movements of the soul&#x27;s life.(1) External.A characteristic instance of the former idea of authority is found in A. J. Balfour&#x27;s Foundations of Belief: &quot;Authority as I have been using the term is in all cases contrasted with reason, and stands for that group of non-rational causes, moral, social and educational, which produces its results by psychic processes other than reasoning&quot; (p. 232, 8th edition). The bulk of men&#x27;s important beliefs are produced and authorized by &quot;custom, education, public opinion, the contagious convictions of countrymen, family, party or church&quot; (p. 226). Authority and reason are &quot;rival claimants&quot; (p. 243). &quot;Authority as such is, from the nature of the case, dumb in the presence of argument&quot; (p. 234).Newman makes a kindred distinction between authority in revealed religion and conscience in natural religion, although he do...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">a-venj&#x27; a-venj&#x27;-er: Avenge.--The general idea connected with this word is that of inflicting punishment upon the wrongdoer. Since emphasis may be placed upon the deed itself, the wrongdoer, or the injured party, the verb is found an intransitive (only Le 19:18; see below), transitive (2Sa 4:8 et al.); and also active (De 32:43), passive (Jer 5:9) and reflexive (Es 8:13). In 1Sa 25:26 ff avenge is translated from yasha`, &quot;to save&quot; (Revised Version margin, &quot;thine own hand saving thee&quot;), in Ho 1:4 from paqadh, &quot;to visit,&quot; and in 2Sa 18:19 ff from shaphaT, &quot;to judge,&quot; but the usual Hebrew word is naqam, or derivatives, &quot;to avenge.&quot;The translation in the Revised Version (British and American) differs in some places from King James Version: Nu 31:3 Revised Version (British and American) &quot;execute Yahweh&#x27;s vengeance&quot;; (compare 2Sa 22:48; Ps 18:47; Le 26:25); Le 19:18 Revised Version (British and American) &quot;take vengeance&quot;; Jud 5:2 Revised Version (British and American) &quot;for that the leaders took the lead in Israel&quot; from para`, &quot;to be free, to lead&quot;.In the New Testament avenge is translated from the Greek ekdikeo, &quot;to do justice,&quot; &quot;to protect&quot; (Lu 18:3 ff et al.) and the King James Version Re 18:20, krino, &quot;to judge&quot; Revised Version (British and American) &quot;God hath judged your judgment&quot;.Avenger.--That is, the person who inflicts punishment upon the evil-doer for a wrong experienced by himself (from naqam, &quot;to avenge&quot;; Ps 8:2 et al.) or by someone else from ga&#x27;al, &quot;to redeem&quot;; (Nu 35:12 ff et al.). In the New Testament avenger occurs only once; &quot;the Lord is an avenger in all things&quot; (1Th 4:6). It was the duty of the nearest relative to execute vengeance upon the murderer of his kin: he became the go&#x27;el. With reference to the protective legislation and custom, see GOEL.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">o: Fear mingled with reverence and wonder, a state of mind inspired by something terrible or sublime.In the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) it occurs in Ps 4:4: &quot;Stand in awe, and sin not&quot; (where the Revised Version, margin has, &quot;Be ye angry,&quot; so Septuagint; compare Eph 4:26); Ps 33:8; 119:161. In the following passages the Revised Version (British and American) substitutes &quot;stand in awe&quot; for the King James Version &quot;fear&quot;: Ps 22:23 phoboumenoi;Isa 29:23; 1Sa 18:15; Mal 2:5; and in Heb 12:28 it substitutes &quot;awe&quot; for the King James Version &quot;reverence&quot; (deos here only in New Testament). In all these passages, except 1Sa 18:15 (eulabeito, where it describes Saul&#x27;s feeling toward David), the word stands for man&#x27;s attitude of reverential fear toward God. This is the characteristic attitude of the pious soul toward God in the Scriptures, especially in the Old Testament. It arises from a consciousness of the infinite power, sublimity and holiness of God, which fills the mind with the &quot;fear of the Lord,&quot; and a dread of violating His law. See FEAR.D.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">aks; aks&#x27;hed: Nine different Hebrew words have been rendered &quot;ax&quot;:(1) garzen. This unquestionably was one of the larger chopping instruments, as the uses to which it was put would imply (De 19:5; 20:19; 1Ki 6:7; Isa 10:15). The modern ax used by the woodchoppers in Syria has a shape much like the ancient stone and bronze axes, with the exception that it is fastened to the handle by passing the latter through a hole in the ax-head, whereas the Egyptian sculptures show that their ax-heads were held to the handles by means of thongs. The so-called battle-ax found at Tell el-Chesy was probably fastened in this way. Syrian peasants are frequently seen carrying in their belts small hatchets the heads of which are shaped like a battle-ax and which are bound to the handles by thongs.(2) ma`atsar, is used in Isa 44:12 (King James Version renders &quot;tongs&quot;) and in Jer 10:3.(3) qardom, is used in Jud 9:48; 1Sa 13:20,21; Ps 74:5; Jer 46:22. The present Arabic word, qudum, which is the name for the native adze, is from the same origin. The adze is the only chopping instrument of the Syrian carpenter. He uses it for many purposes, where a foreigner would use a saw or chisel or plane, and with a skill which the foreigner envies. Many students of Syrian life believe that the adze is a tool which has survived from the early Hebrew times.(4) barzel (De 19:5; 2Ki 6:5): The interest associated with this word is that it literally means &quot;iron,&quot; although the context indicates that it means &quot;ax.&quot; If the word iron was not used here to mean &quot;metal,&quot; then iron axes were used by the children of Israel. If iron axes existed, however, they have long since disappeared as the result of corrosion, since the only ones discovered have been of stone, copper or bronze. See METALS.(5) maghzirah (2Sa 12:31) is literally, &quot;a cutting instrument,&quot; and might be rendered, &quot;a blade&quot; or sickle.(6) megherah (1Ch 20:2), translated in this one passage as axes, but better translated &quot;saws.&quot;(7) cherebh (Eze 26:9), rendered ax in this passage only. It is usually translated sword. It could also mean pick-axe.(8) kashil (Ps 74:6 the King James Version), literally, &quot;a feller,&quot; hence, an axe.(9) mapets (Jer 51:20), literally, &quot;a smiter,&quot; hence, a war club or battle-axe. The Greek word used in the New Testament is axine (Mt 3:10; Lu 3:9).James A. Patch</p>

The Arabs have two pronunciations, one a very strong guttural formed at the back of the palate, something like a rattled &quot;r&quot; or &quot;rg,&quot; the other similar in quality, only less harsh and guttural. The Septuagint reproduced the `ayin (`) in some cases by the Greek letter gamma (g). The numerical value of this letter is 70. An `ayin (`) begins each verse of the 16th section of Ps 119 in the Hebrew.W.W. Davies</p>

THE MEANING OF THE WORD1. The Passages to Be Considered2. The Proposed Interpretations(1) The Etymology(2) The ExplanationII. WHAT IS DONE IN CONNECTION WITH AZAZEL1. The Significance of This Action2. The Jewish LiturgyI. The Meaning of the Word1. The Passages to Be Considered:This word is found in connection with the ceremony of the Day of Atonement (which see). According to Le 16:8, Aaron is to cast lots upon the two goats which on the part of the congregation are to serve as a sin offering (Le 16:5), &quot;one be lot for Yahweh, and the other lot for Azazel.&quot; In Le 16:10, after the first goat has been set apart as a sin offering for Yahweh, we read: &quot;But the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, shall be set alive before Yahweh, to make atonement for him, to send him away for Azazel into the wilderness.&quot; In Le 16:26 we read: &quot;And he that letteth go the goat for Azazel shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water.&quot; Before this, in Le 16:21f mention had been made of what should be done with the goat. After the purification of the (inner) sanctuary, of the tent of meeting, and of the altar, the living goat is to brought, &quot;and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all .... their sins; and he shall put them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a man that is in readiness into the wilderness: and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a solitary land: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.&quot; But in this last mentioned and most important passage the term under consideration is not found.2. The Proposed Interpretations:(1) The Etymology.Some have derived the word from `az plus &#x27;azal (fortis abiens, &quot;passing away in his strength&quot; or from an intentional alteration of &#x27;el plus `azaz, robur Dei, &quot;strength of God&quot;; compare below the angel of the Book of Enoch); while others have regarded the word as a broken plural of a substantive in the Arabic `azala, and translated it as &quot;lonesomeness,&quot; &quot;desert.&quot; Now there is an inclination to regard it as a reduplication from `azalzel, derived from the root `azal. If we accept this view, although it is without certainty and an exact analogue cannot be found, we could conclude from the way in which this noun has been formed that we have before us not an abstract term (remotio, &quot;removal,&quot; or abitus, &quot;departure&quot;), but a concrete noun, or an adjective, longe remotus (&quot;far removed&quot;) or porro abiens (&quot;going far away&quot;).(2) The Explanation.In Le 16:10,22,26, we would have an acceptable sense, if we regarded this word as expressive of a distinct locality in the wilderness. But this interpretation is impossible, since the law in Le 16 was given during the wanderings in the wilderness and accordingly presupposed a constant change in the encampment, even if this should be regarded only as the historical background.

In Jos 10:10 the defeated kings of the Arnorites are described as flying before Joshua &quot;by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon .... to Azekah, and unto Makkedah&quot; and (Jos 10:11) as the host fled &quot;Yahweh cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died.&quot; In 1Sa 17:1 it is recorded that before David&#x27;s combat with Goliath, the Philistines &quot;gathered together at Socoh, which belongeth to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammin.&quot; In 2Ch 11:9 it is mentioned as one of the frontier cities which Rehoboam fortified and in Jer 34:7 it is one of the two fortified cities remaining to Judah in the Shephelah which Nebuchadnezzar was besieging. &quot;Azekah and the towns (margin, &quot;daughters&quot;) thereof&quot; is mentioned among the cities reoccupied by Jews returning after the Exile (Ne 11:30). In all the three last references the place is mentioned along with Lachish.All the data suit Tell Zaqareyeh on the North side of the Vale of Elah (Wady es-Sunt) and some 3 miles Northwest of Socoh (Kh. Shuweikeh). This site, which was partially excavated by the Palestine Exploration Fund, is one of great natural strength. &quot;The hill stands almost isolated, rising abruptly for almost 350 ft. above the Vale of Elah; .... to the West the fall is also very great, while to the South the tell is joined by a neck of land (about 100 ft. below the summit) to a hill behind.&quot; The summit is about 350 yds. by 150 yds., and is much larger than Tell el-Chesy (Lachish) (Bliss). Excavations showed that it was a very ancient site which had been powerfully fortified, and the rock under the city was excavated in a series of very extraordinary underground chambers which could be used as places of refuge. The site suits the narrative of Joshua&#x27;s battle every well, as there is a long-used high route running North to South from the neighborhood of Ajalon. Its position as a frontier fortress is comparable with that of Lachish: the name Zakareyeh, seems to be a survival of Azekah. See PEFS, 1899, 10 ff; PEF, III, 441.E. W. G. Masterman</p>
