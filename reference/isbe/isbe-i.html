          <h3>IBLEAM</h3>
          <p>ib&#x27;-le-am (yibhle`am); A town in the territory of Issachar which was assigned to Manasseh (Jos 17:11). This tribe, however, failed to expel the inhabitants, so the Canaanites continued to dwell in that land (Jud 1:27). It was on the route by which Ahaziah fled from Jehu. He was overtaken and mortally wounded &quot;at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam&quot; (2Ki 9:27). The name appears as Bileam in 1Ch 6:70; and it probably corresponds to Belmen of Jth. It is now represented by the ruin of Bel`ameh on the West of the valley through which the road to the south runs, about half a mile from Jenin. In 2Ki 15:10, where it is said that Zechariah the son of Jeroboam was slain by Shallum &quot;before the people,&quot; this last phrase, which is awkward in the Hebrew, should be amended to read &quot;in Bileam.&quot; Possibly &quot;Gath-rimmon&quot; in Jos 21:25 is a clerical error for &quot;Ibleam.&quot;W.

          <p>ib&#x27;-zan (ibhtsan): The 10th judge of Israel. His city is given as Bethlehem (whether of Judah or Zebulun is not stated). He judged Israel 7 years, and when he died he was buried in his native place. The only personal details given about him in the Biblical narrative are that he had 30 sons and a like number of daughters. He sent all of his sons &quot;abroad&quot; for wives and brought husbands from &quot;abroad&quot; for all his daughters. The exact meaning of ha-chuts, &quot;abroad,&quot; is mere matter of speculation, but the great social importance of the man and, possibly, alliances among tribes, are suggested in the brief narrative (Jud 12:8-10). Jewish tradition identifies Ibzan with Boaz of Bethlehem-Judah (Talmud, Babha&#x27;, Bathra&#x27;, 91a).Ella Davis Isaacs</p>

          <h3>ICE</h3>
          <p>is (qerach): Ice is almost unknown in Palestine and Syria except on the highest mountains. At moderate heights of less than 4,000 ft. a little ice may form during the night in winter, but the warm rays of the sun melt it the next day. A great quantity of snow is packed away in caves in the mountains during the winter, and is thus preserved for use in the summer months. The word is found in the Bible in three places where it describes God&#x27;s power. &quot;Out of whose womb came the ice? And the .... frost&quot; (Job 38:29); &quot;By the breath of God ice is given&quot; (Job 37:10); &quot;He casteth forth his ice like morsels&quot; (Ps 147:17).Figurative: Untrue friends are compared to streams &quot;which are black by reason of the ice&quot; (Job 6:16).Alfred H.

Ichabod was born after his father&#x27;s death. His mother gave him this name on her death-bed to indicate that the &quot;glory (had) departed from Israel&quot; (1Sa 4:19). He was thus important as a symbol, though little is recorded of him as an individual. His nephew Ahijah was one of those who tarried with Saul and the six hundred at Gibeah just before Jonathan&#x27;s brave attack upon the Philistines (1Sa 14:2 f).Henry Wallace</p>

          <h3>ICONIUM</h3>
          <p>i-ko&#x27;-ni-um (Ikonion, also Eikonion, on inscriptions): Iconium was visited by Paul on his first and on his second missionary journey (Ac 13:51 ff; 16:2), andif the &quot;South Galatian theory&quot; be correct, probably also on his third journey. His sufferings there are referred to in 2Ti 3:11.1. Topographical Position:The topographical position of Iconium is clearly indicated in Acts, and the evidence of Ac has been confirmed by recent research. Was Iconium in Phrygia or in Lycaonia, and in what sense can it be said to have belonged to one ethnical division or the other? The majority of our ancient authorities (e.g. Cicero, Strabo, Pliny), writing from the point of view of Roman provincial administration, give Iconium to Lycaonia, of which geography makes it the natural capital. But Xenophon, who marched with Cyrus&#x27; expedition through Phrygia into Lycaonia, calls Iconium the last city of Phrygia. The writer of Ac 14:6 makes the same statement when he represents Paul and Barnabas as fleeing from Iconium to the cities of Lycaonia--implying that the border of Phrygia and Lycaonia passed between Iconium and Lystra, 18 miles to the South. Other ancient authorities who knew the local conditions well speak of Iconium as Phrygian until far into the Roman imperial period. At the neighboring city of Lystra (Ac 14:11), the natives used the &quot;speech of Lycaonia.&quot; Two inscriptions in the Phrygian language found at Iconium in 1910 prove that the Phrygian language was in use there for 2 centuries after Paul&#x27;s visits, and afford confirmation of the interesting topographical detail in Ac (see Jour. Hell. Stud., 1911, 189).2. In Apostolic Period:In the apostolic period, Iconium was one of the chief cities in the southern part of the Roman province Galatia, and it probably belonged to the &quot;Phrygian region&quot; mentioned in Ac 16:6. The emperor Claudius conferred on it the title Claudiconium, which appears on coins of the city and on inscriptions, and was formerly taken as a proof that Claudius raised the city to the rank of a Roman colonia. It was Hadrian who raised the city to colonial rank; this is proved by its new title, Colonia Aelia Hadriana Iconiensium, and by a recently discovered inscription, which belongs to the reign of Hadrian, and which mentions the first duumvir who was appointed in the new colonia. Iconium was still a Hellenic city, but with a strong pro-Roman bias (as proved by its title &quot;Claudian&quot;) when Paul visited it.3. Later History:About 295 AD, an enlarged province, Pisidia, was formed, with Antioch as capital, and Iconium as a &quot;sort of secondary metropolis.&quot; The Byzantine arrangement, familiar to us in the Notitiae Episcopatuum, under which Iconium was the capital of a province Lycaonia, dates from about 372 AD. Iconium, the modern Konia, has always been the main trading center of the Lycaonian Plain. Trade attracted Jews to the ancient Phrygio-Hellenic city (Ac 14:1), as it attracts Greeks and Armenians to the modern Turkish town.4. Thekla:Paul&#x27;s experien...</p>

          <h3>IDLE; IDLENESS</h3>
          <p>i&#x27;-d&#x27;-l, i&#x27;-d&#x27;-l-nes: Both words, adjective and noun, render different Hebrew words (from `atsel, &quot;to be lazy,&quot; raphah, &quot;to relax,&quot; and shaqaT, &quot;to be quiet&quot;). According to the Yahwistic narrative Pharaoh&#x27;s retort to the complaints of the Israelites was a charge of indolence (Ex 5:8,17). It was a favorite thought of Hebrew wisdom--practical philosophy of life--that indolence inevitably led to poverty and want (Pr 19:15; Ec 10:18). The &quot;virtuous woman&quot; was one who would not eat the &quot;bread of idleness&quot; (Pr 31:27). In Eze 16:49 for the King James Version &quot;abundance of idleness,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) has &quot;prosperous ease.&quot; In the New Testament &quot;idle&quot; generally renders the Greek word argos, literally, &quot;inactive,&quot; &quot;useless&quot; (Mt 20:3,6). In Lu 24:11 &quot;idle talk&quot; corresponds to one Greek word which means &quot;empty gossip&quot; or &quot;nonsensical talk.&quot;T. Lewis</p>

Idolatry originally meant the worship of idols, or the worship of false gods by means of idols, but came to mean among the Old Testament Hebrews any worship of false gods, whether by images or otherwise, and finally the worship of Yahweh through visible symbols (Ho 8:5,6; 10:5); and ultimately in the New Testament idolatry came to mean, not only the giving to any creature or human creation the honor or devotion which belonged to God alone, but the giving to any human desire a precedence over God&#x27;s will (1Co 10:14; Ga 5:20; Col 3:5; 1Pe 4:3). The neighboring gods of Phoenicia, Canaan, Moab--Baal, Melkart, Astarte, Chemosh, Moloch, etc.--were particularly attractive to Jerusalem, while the old Semitic calf-worship seriously affected the state religion of the Northern Kingdom (see GOLDEN CALF). As early as the Assyrian and Babylonian periods (8th and 7th centuries BC), various deities from the Tigris and Euphrates had intruded themselves--the worship of Tammuz becoming a little later the most popular and seductive of all (Eze 8:14)--while the worship of the sun, moon, stars and signs of the Zodiac became so intensely fascinating that these were introduced even into the temple itself (2Ki 17:16; 21:3-7; 23:4,12; Jer 19:13; Eze 8:16; Am 5:26).The special enticements to idolatry as offered by these various cults were found in their deification of natural forces and their appeal to primitive human desires, especially the sexual; also through associations produced by intermarriage and through the appeal to patriotism, when the help of some cruel deity was sought in time of war. Baal and Astarte worship, which was especially attractive, was closely associated with fornication and drunkenness (Am 2:7,8; compare 1Ki 14:23 f), and also appealed greatly to magic and soothsaying (e.g. Isa 2:6; 3:2; 8:19).Sacrifices to the idols were offered by fire (Ho 4:13); libations were poured out (Isa 57:6; Jer 7:18); the first-fruits of the earth and tithes were presented (Ho 2:8); tables of food were set before them (Isa 65:11); the worshippers kissed the idols or threw them kisses (1Ki 19:18; Ho 13:2; Job 31:27); stretched out their hands in adoration (Isa 44:20); knelt or prostrated themselves before them and sometimes danced about the altar, gashing themselves with knives (1Ki 18:26,28; for a fuller summary see EB).Even earlier than the Babylonian exile the Hebrew prophets taught that Yahweh was not only superior to all other gods, but reigned alone as God, other deities being nonentities (Le 19:4; Isa 2:8,18,20; 19:1,3; 31:7; 44:9-20). The severe satire of this period proves that the former fear of living demons supposed to inhabit the idols had disappeared. These prophe...</p>

          <h3>IGNORANCE</h3>
          <p>ig&#x27;-no-rans (sheghaghah; agnoia): &quot;Ignorance&quot; is the translation of sheghaghah, &quot;wandering,&quot; &quot;going astray&quot; (Le 4:2, etc., &quot;if a soul sin through ignorance,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;unwittingly,&quot; margin &quot;through error&quot;; Le 5:15; Nu 15:24 ff; compare 35:11; Jos 20:3 ff; Ec 5:6; 10:5, &quot;an error&quot;). In the Law sheghaghah means &quot;innocent error,&quot; such as had to be taken with consideration in judgment (see passages referred to). &quot;Ignorance&quot; is also expressed by the negative lo&#x27; with yadha`, &quot;to know&quot; (Isa 56:10; 63:16; Ps 73:22); also by bi-bheli da`ath, literally, &quot;in want of knowledge&quot; (De 19:4; compare De 4:12; Jos 20:5, translated &quot;unawares,&quot; &quot;unwittingly&quot;).In the New Testament the words are agnoia, &quot;absence of knowledge&quot; (Ac 3:17; 17:30; Eph 4:18; 1Pe 1:14); agneoma, &quot;error&quot; (Heb 9:7, the Revised Version margin &quot;Greek: ignorances&quot;); agnosia, &quot;ignorance&quot; (1Pe 2:15), &quot;no knowledge&quot; (1Co 15:34 the Revised Version (British and American)); agnoeo, &quot;to be without knowledge,&quot; &quot;ignorant&quot; (Ro 1:13; 10:3; 11:25, etc.), &quot;not knowing&quot; (Ro 2:4, etc.), &quot;understood not&quot; (Mr 9:32, etc.), &quot;ignorantly&quot; (Ac 17:23, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;in ignorance&quot;; 1Ti 1:13); idiotes, translated &quot;ignorant&quot; (Ac 4:13), &quot;unlearned&quot; (1Co 14:16, the Revised Version margin &quot;him that is without gifts,&quot; and so in 1Co 14:23,14), &quot;rude&quot; (2Co 11:6); agrammatos, once only in connection with idiotes (Ac 4:13, &quot;unlearned and ignorant men&quot;); agrammatos corresponds to modern &quot;illiterate&quot; (compare Joh 7:15; Ac 26:24); idiotes originally denoted &quot;the private man&quot; as distinguished from those with a knowledge of affairs, and took on the idea of contempt and scorn. In Philo it denoted the whole congregation of Israel as distinguished from the priests (De Vita Mosis, III 29). With Paul (1Co 14:16,23,24) it seems to denote &quot;plain believers as distinguished from those with special spiritual gifts.&quot; In Ac 4:13 it may refer to the want of Jewish learning; certainly it does not mean ignorant in the modern sense.Paul in Ro 1:18,32 attributes the pre-Christian ignorance of God to &quot;the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hinder the truth in unrighteousness&quot; (but the margin has, with the King James Version, &quot;hold the truth, compare 1Co 7:30, Gr&quot;); many, however (Alford, De Wette, Meyer and others), translation &quot;hold back the truth.&quot; A willful ignorance is also referred to in Eph 4:17 f; 2Pe 3:5. But there is also a less blameworthy ignorance. Paul at Athens spoke of &quot;times of ignorance&quot; which God had &quot;overlooked&quot; (Ac 17:30); Paul says of himself that he &quot;obtained mercy, because (he) did it (against Christ) ignorantly in unbelief&quot; (1Ti 1:13); Peter said to the Jews (Ac 3:17) that they and their rulers rejected Christ &quot;in ignorance&quot; (compare 1Co 2:8); and Jesus Himself prayed for those who crucified Him: &quot;Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do&quot;; (Lu 23:34); in Heb 5:2 the necessary qualification of a high priest is that he &quot;can bear gently with the ig...</p>

          <h3>ILLYRICUM</h3>
          <p>i-lir&#x27;-i-kum (Illurikon): A province of the Roman Empire, lying East and Northeast of the Adriatic Sea. In his Epistle to the Romans Paul emphasizes the extent of his missionary activities in the assertion that &quot;from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ&quot; (15:19). An examination of this statement involves three questions: What is the force of the preposition &quot;even unto&quot; (mechri)? What meaning is borne by the word Illyricum? and, At what period of his missionary career did Paul reach the limit here spoken of?1. Force of &quot;even unto&quot;:In Greek, as in English, the preposition &quot;unto&quot; may either be exclusive or inclusive. In other words, Paul may mean that he has preached throughout Macedonia as far as the Illyrian frontier, or his words may involve a journey within Illyricum itself, extending perhaps to Dyrrhachium (mod. Durazzo) on the Adriatic seaboard, which, though belonging politically to Macedonia, lay in &quot;Greek, Illyria.&quot; But since no word is said in the Ac of any extension of Paul&#x27;s travels beyond the confines of Macedonia, and since the phrase, &quot;I have fully preached,&quot; precludes a reference to a hurried or cursory tour in Illyricum, we should probably take the word &quot;unto&quot; in its exclusive sense, and understand that Paul claims to have evangelized Macedonia as far as the frontier of Illyricum.2. Meaning of &quot;Illyricum&quot;:What, then, does the word &quot;Illyricum&quot; denote? It is sometimes used, like the Greek terms Illyris and Illyria, to signify a vast area lying between the Danube on the North and Macedonia and Thrace on the South, extending from the Adriatic and the Alps to the Black Sea, and inhabited by a number of warlike and semi-civilized tribes known to the Greeks under the general title of Illyrians (Appian, Illyr. 1; Suetonius, Tiberius, 16); it thus comprised the provinces of Illyricum (in the narrower sense), Pannonia and Moesia, which for certain financial and military purposes formed a single administrative area, together with a strip of coast land between Dalmatia and Epirus and, at a later date, Dacia. Appian (Illyr. 6) even extends the term to include Raetia and Noricum, but in this he appears to be in error. But Illyricum has also a narrower and more precise meaning, denoting a single Roman province, which varied in extent with the advance of the Roman conquest but was finally organized in 10 AD by the emperor Augustus. At first it bore the name superior provincia Illyricum or simply Illyricum; later it came to be known as Dalmatia (Tac. Annals, iv.5; Josephus, BJ, II, xvi; Dio Cassius, xlix.36, etc.). In accordance with Paul&#x27;s habitual usage of such terms, together with the fact that he employs a Greek form which is a transliteration of the Latin Illyricum but does not occur in any other extant Greek writer, and the fact that he is here writing to the church at Rome, we may conclude that in Ro 15:19 Illyricum bears its more restricted meaning.3.

          <h3>IMAGE</h3>
          <p>im&#x27;-aj (tselem; eikon): Its usage falls under 3 main heads.(1) &quot;Image&quot; as object of idolatrous worship (translations about a dozen words, including maccekhah, &quot;molten image&quot; (De 9:12, etc.); matstsebhah, in the King James Version translated &quot;image&quot; or &quot;pillar,&quot; in the Revised Version (British and American) always &quot;pillar&quot; (Ex 23:24, etc.); pecel, &quot;graven image&quot; (Ex 20:4, etc.); tselem, &quot;image&quot; (2Ki 11:18, etc.); eikon, &quot;image&quot; (e.g. Re 14:9));(2) of man as made in the image of God; (3) of Christ as the image of God. Here we are concerned with the last two usages. For &quot;image&quot; in connection with idolatrous practices, see IDOLATRY; IMAGES; PILLAR; TERAPHIM, etc.I. Man as Made in the Divine Image.1. In the Old Testament:To define man&#x27;s fundamental relation to God, the priestly writer in Ge uses two words: &quot;image&quot; (tselem) and &quot;likeness&quot; (demuth); once employing both together (Ge 1:26; compare Ge 5:3), but elsewhere one without the other, &quot;image&quot; only in Ge 1:27; 9:6, and &quot;likeness&quot; only in 5:1. The priestly writer alone in the Old Testament uses this expression to describe the nature of man, though the general meaning of the passage Ge 1:26 f is echoed in Ps 8:5-8, and the term itself reappears in Apocrypha (Sirach 17:3; The Wisdom of Solomon 2:23) and in the New Testament (see below).The idea is important in relation to the Biblical doctrine of man, and has figured prominently in theological discussion. The following are some of the questions that arise:(1) Is there any distinction to be understood between &quot;image&quot; and &quot;likeness&quot;? Most of the Fathers, and some later theologians, attempt to distinguish between them.(a) Some have referred &quot;image&quot; to man&#x27;s bodily form, and &quot;likeness&quot; to his spiritual nature (Justin Martyr, Irenaeus).(b) Others, especially the Alexandrian Fathers, understood by the &quot;image&quot; the mental and moral endowments native to man, and by the &quot;likeness&quot; the Divine perfections which man can only gradually acquire by free development and moral conflict (Clement of Alexandria and Origen), or which is conferred on man as a gift of grace.(c) This became the basis of the later Roman Catholic distinction between the natural gifts of rationality and freedom (= the image), and the supernatural endowments of grace which God bestowed on man after He had created him (the likeness = donum superadditum). The former remained after the Fall, though in an enfeebled state; the latter was lost through sin, but restored by Christ. The early Protestants rejected this distinction, maintaining that supernatural righteousness was part of the true nature and idea of man, i.e. was included in the &quot;image,&quot; and not merely externally superadded. Whatever truth these distinctions may or may not contain theologically, they cannot be exegetically inferred from Ge 1:26, where (as is now generally admitted) no real difference is intended.We have here simply a &quot;duplication of synonyms&quot; (Driver) for the sake of emphasis. The two terms are elsewhere used interchangeably...</p>

Some maintain that the cult was of foreign origin, either Egyptian (Bertholet, Commentary on Ezekiel), or Babylonian (Redpath, Westminster Commentary on Ezekiel); others that it was the revival of ancient superstitions of a totemistic kind which had survived in obscure circles in Israel (W.R. Smith, Lectures on the Religion of the Semites, revised edition, 357). The word here rendered &quot;imagery&quot; is elsewhere in the King James Version translated &quot;image&quot; (of stone) (Le 26:1, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;figured stone&quot;), &quot;pictures&quot; (Nu 33:52, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;figured stones&quot;; Pr 25:11, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;network&quot;); twice it means imagination, conceit, i.e. a mental picture (Ps 73:20; Pr 18:11). &quot;Imagery&quot; occurs once in Apocrypha (Sirach 38:27 the King James Version, eis homoiosai zographian, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;to preserve likeness in his portraiture&quot;).D.

Definition:Images, as used here, are visible representations of supposedly supernatural or divine beings or powers. They may be(1) themselves objects of worship,(2) pictures, embodiments or dwelling-places (temple, ark, pillar, priests) of deities worshipped,(3) empowered instruments (amulets, charms, etc.) of object or objects worshipped,(4) pictures or symbols of deities reverenced though not worshipped.These images may be shapeless blocks, or symmetrically carved figures, or objects of Nature, such as animals, sun, moon, stars, etc. These visible objects may sometimes be considered, especially by the uninstructed, as deities, while by others in the small community they are thought of as instruments or symbolizations of deity. Even when they are thought of as deities, this does not exclude a sense and apprehension of a spiritual godhead, since visible corporeal beings may have invisible souls and spiritual attributes, and even the stars may be thought of as &quot;seats of celestial spirits.&quot; An idol is usually considered as either the deity itself or his permanent tenement; a fetish is an object which has been given a magical or divine power, either because of its having been the temporary home of the deity, or because it has been formed or handled or otherwise spiritually influenced by such deity. The idol is generally communal, the fetish private; the idol is protective, the fetish is usually not for the common good. (See Jevons, Idea of Cod in Early Religions, 1910.) Relics and symbolic figures do not become &quot;images&quot; in the objectionable sense until reverence changes to worship. Until comparatively recent times, the Hebrews seem to have offered no religious objection to &quot;artistic&quot; images, as is proved not only from the description of Solomon&#x27;s temple, but also from the discoveries of the highly decorated temple of Yahweh at Syene dating from the 6th century BC, and from ruins of synagogues dating from the pre-Christian and early Christian periods (PEF, January, 1908; The Expositor, December, 1907; Expository Times, January and February, 1908). The Second Commandment was not an attack upon artists and sculptors but upon idolaters. Decoration by means of graven figures was not in ancient times condemned, though, as Josephus shows, by the time of the Seleucids all plastic art was regarded with suspicion. The brazen serpent was probably destroyed in Hezekiah&#x27;s time because it had ceased to be an ancient artistic relic and had become an object of worship (see below). So the destruction of the ark and altar and temple, which for so long a time had been the mea...</p>

In Isa 26:3 yetser is translated &quot;mind&quot; (King James Version margin &quot;thought&quot; or &quot;imagination&quot;), &quot;whose mind is stayed on thee&quot; (the Revised Version margin &quot;or imagination&quot;); in Ps 103:14 it is &quot;frame&quot;; of sheriruth, &quot;obstinacy,&quot; &quot;stubbornness&quot; (De 29:19; Jer 3:17; 7:24; 9:14; 11:8; 13:10; 16:12; 18:12; 23:17); in Ps 81:12 the King James Version it is, &quot;lust,&quot; margin &quot;hardness or imaginations&quot;; 3 times of machashebheth, &quot;thought&quot; or &quot;purpose&quot; in the King James Version (Pr 6:18; La 3:60,61); once of dianoia, &quot;mind,&quot; &quot;understanding&quot; (Lu 1:51); of logismos, &quot;reasoning&quot; (2Co 10:5); and of dialogismos, &quot;reasoning through&quot; (Ro 1:21 the King James Version).The Revised Version (British and American) gives &quot;stubbornness&quot; in each instance where sheriruth is in the King James Version translated &quot;imagination&quot;; in Pr 6:18 the American Standard Revised Version has &quot;purposes&quot;; the Revised Version (British and American) has &quot;devices&quot; (La 3:60,61) and &quot;reasonings&quot; (Ro 1:21), &quot;imagination&quot; for &quot;conceit&quot; (Pr 18:11), and (English Revised Version) for &quot;device&quot; (La 3:62).&quot;Imagination&quot; is frequent in Apocrypha, e.g. Ecclesiasticus 22:18 (dianoema); 37:3 (enthumema, &quot;wicked imagination&quot;); 40:2 (dialogismos, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;expectation&quot;).W.

          <h3>IMMACULATE CONCEPTION, THE</h3>
          <p>i-mak&#x27;-u-lat kon-sep&#x27;-shun:1. Definition:The historic designation of the Roman Catholic dogma promulgated by Pope Pius IX on December 8, 1854, in the Papal Bull entitled &quot;Ineffabilis Deus.&quot; The term is often incorrectly applied, even by those whose intelligence should make such an error impossible, to the VIRGIN BIRTH of Christ (which see).2. Statement of the Dogma:The central affirmation of this proclamation, which was read in Peter&#x27;s in the presence of over two hundred bishops, is expressed in the following words: It is proclaimed &quot;by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ and the blessed Apostles Peter and Paul and in our own authority, that the doctrine which holds the blessed Virgin Mary to have been, from the first instant of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege of Almighty God, in view of the merits of Christ Jesus the Saviour of Mankind, preserved free from all stain of original sin, was revealed by Cod, and is, therefore, to be firmly and constantly believed by all the faithful&quot; (see Schaff, A History of the Creeds of Christendom, II, 211, 212).3. Objections to the Dogma:(1) Drawn from Specifically Protestant Principles.Objections to the dogma are mainly two:(a) the claim to authority upon which the proclamation rests. There is every reason to believe that one of the major motives to the entire transaction was the wish, on the part of Pius and his advisers, to make an unmistakable assertion of absolute doctrinal authority by the Roman pontiff. To Protestants of all shades of opinion there would be unbearable offense in the wording of the decree, even if assent could be given to the doctrine itself. The whole vital issue of the Reformation is involved in the use by an ecclesiastic of the words &quot;in our own authority&quot; in addition to the words &quot;by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ and the blessed Apostles Peter and Paul.&quot;(b) The tendency to Mariolatry in the entire movement. As we shall see, the ascription of Divine honors to Mary is avoided in the public statement of the dogma and in the defense of it by Roman Catholic writers, but one has but to survey the course of discussion leading up to the publication of 1854, and subsequent to it, to discover a growing tendency to lift Mary out of the realm of human beings and to endow her with Divine attributes and functions. An extended discussion of Mariolatry lies beyond the range of this article (see MARY); it is only necessary to point out the obvious connections (see Roman Catholic Dictionary and church histories, sub loc.).(2) Drawn from Roman Catholic Principles.It is far from the truth to suppose that there are no objections to this modern dogma save those which are specifically Protestant. From the viewpoint of the devout Roman Catholic, and for the sake of the prestige of the papacy, this particular dogma seems to have been unfortunately chosen.(a) It Has No Basis in Scripture.The only attempt made to provide a Scriptural argument is by using a vague and unsatisfactory p...</p>

          <h3>IMMANUEL</h3>
          <p>i-man&#x27;-u-el (`immanu&#x27;el): The name occurs but 3 times, twice in the Old Testament (Isa 7:14; 8:8), and once in the New Testament (Mt 1:23). It is a Hebrew word signifying &quot;God is with us.&quot; The form &quot;Emmanuel&quot; appears in Septuagint (Emmanouel).1. Isaiah Rebukes Ahaz:In 735 BC Ahaz was king of Judah. The kingdom of Israel was already tributary to Assyria (2Ki 15:19,20). Pekah, king of Israel, a bold and ambitious usurper, and Rezin, king of Syria, formed an alliance, the dual object of which was, first, to organize a resistance against Assyria, and second, to force Ahaz to cooperate in their designs against the common tyrant. In the event of Ahaz&#x27; refusal, they planned to depose him, and to set the son of Tabeel, a choice of their own, upon the throne of David. To this end they waged war against Judah, advancing as far as Jerusalem itself, but without complete success (Isa 7:1). Ahaz, a weak king, and now panic-stricken, determined to invoke the aid of Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria (2Ki 16:7). This he actually did at a later stage in the war (2Ki 6:9; 15:29). Such a course would involve the loss of national independence and the payment of a heavy tribute. At this period of crisis, Isaiah, gathering his disciples around him (Isa 8:16), is told to deliver a message to the king. Ahaz, though making a show of resistance against the coalition, is in reality neither depending upon the help of Yahweh nor upon the courage of his people. Isaiah, in an effort to calm his fears and prevent the fatal alliance with Assyria, offers him a sign. This method is specially characteristic of this prophet. Fearing to commit himself to the policy of Divine dependence, but with a pretense at religious scruples, &quot;Neither will I tempt Yahweh,&quot; the king refuses (Isa 7:12). The prophet then chides him bitterly for his lack of faith, which, he says, not only wearies men, but God also (Isa 7:13).2. The Sign of &quot;Immanuel&quot;:He then proceeds to give him a sign from God Himself, the sign of &quot;Immanuel&quot; (Isa 7:14). The interpretation of this sign is not clear, even apart from its New Testament application to Christ. The Hebrew word translated &quot;virgin&quot; in English Versions of the Bible means, more correctly, &quot;bride,&quot; in the Old English sense of one who is about to become a wife, or is still a young wife. Ps 68:25 English Versions of the Bible gives &quot;damsels.&quot;Isaiah predicts that a young bride shall conceive and bear a son. The miracle of virgin-conception, therefore, is not implied. The use of the definite article before &quot;virgin&quot; (ha-`almah) does not of itself indicate that the prophet had any particular young woman in his mind, as the Hebrew idiom often uses the definite article indefinitely. The fact that two other children of the prophet, like Hosea&#x27;s, bore prophetic and mysterious names, invites the conjecture that the bride referred to was his own wife. The hypothesis of some critics that a woman of the harem of Ahaz became the mother of Hezekiah, and that he was the Immanuel o...</p>

Preliminary--Need of Definition and Distinction:In hardly any subject is it more necessary to be careful in the definition of terms and clear distinction of ideas, especially where the Biblical doctrine is concerned, than in this of &quot;immortality.&quot; By &quot;immortality&quot; is frequently meant simply the survival of the soul, or spiritual part of man, after bodily death. It is the assertion of the fact that death does not end all. The soul survives. This is commonly what is meant when we speak of &quot;a future life,&quot; &quot;a future state,&quot; &quot;a hereafter.&quot; Not, however, to dwell on the fact that many peoples have no clear conception of an immaterial &quot;soul&quot; in the modern sense (the Egyptians, e.g. distinguished several parts, the Ka, the Ba, etc., which survived death; often the surviving self is simply a ghostly resemblance of the earthly self, nourished with food, offerings, etc.), there is the more serious consideration that the state into which the surviving part is supposed to enter at death is anything but a state which can be described as &quot;life,&quot; or worthy to be dignified with the name &quot;immortality.&quot; It is state peculiar to &quot;death&quot; (see DEATH); in most cases, shadowy, inert, feeble, dependent, joyless; a state to be dreaded and shrunk from, not one to be hoped for. If, on the other hand, as in the hope of immortality among the nobler heathen, it is conceived of, as for some, a state of happiness--the clog of the body being shaken off--this yields the idea, which has passed into so much of our modern thinking, of an &quot;immortality of the soul,&quot; of an imperishableness of the spiritual part, sometimes supposed to extend backward as well as forward; an inherent indestructibility.2. Biblical Conception:It will be seen as we advance, that the Biblical view is different from all of these. The soul, indeed, survives the body; but this disembodied state is never viewed as one of complete &quot;life.&quot; For the Bible &quot;immortality&quot; is not merely the survival of the soul, the passing into &quot;Sheol&quot; or &quot;Hades.&quot; This is not, in itself considered, &quot;life&quot; or happiness. The &quot;immortality&quot; the Bible contemplates is an immortality of the whole person--body and soul toge...</p>

          <p>im-pu-ta&#x27;-shun:I. MEANING AND USE OF THE TERMII. THE THREEFOLD USE OF THE TERM IN THEOLOGYOriginal Sin, Atonement, JustificationIII. THE SCRIPTURAL BASIS OF THESE DOCTRINES1. Imputation of Adam&#x27;s Sin to His Posterity2. Imputation of the Sins of His People to Christ3. Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ to His PeopleLITERATUREI. Meaning and Use of the Term.The word &quot;imputation,&quot; according to the Scriptural usage, denotes an attributing of something to a person, or a charging of one with anything, or a setting of something to one&#x27;s account. This takes place sometimes in a judicial manner, so that the thing imputed becomes a ground of reward or punishment. The word is used in the King James Version a number of times to translate the Hebrew verb chashabh and the Greek verb logizomai. These words, both of which occur frequently in Scripture, and which in a number of instances mean simply &quot;to think,&quot; express the above idea. That this is the case is clear also from the other English words used in the King James Version to translate these Hebrew and Greek words, as, for example, &quot;to count,&quot; &quot;to reckon,&quot; &quot;to esteem.&quot; Thus chashabh is translated in the King James Version by the verb &quot;to impute&quot; (Le 7:18; 17:4; 2Sa 19:19); by the verb &quot;to reckon&quot; (2Sa 4:2); by &quot;to count&quot; as something (Le 25:31 English versions). The verb in 1Sa 22:15 is sim. Similarly, logizomai is translated by the verb &quot;to impute&quot; (Ro 4:6,8,11,22,23,24; 2Co 5:19; Jas 2:23); by the verb &quot;to count&quot; (Ro 2:26; 4:3,5); &quot;to account&quot; (Ga 3:6); and by the verb &quot;to reckon&quot; (Ro 4:4,9,10). In the Revised Version (British and American) the word used to render logizomai is the verb &quot;to reckon.&quot;These synonyms of the verb &quot;to impute&quot; bring out the idea of reckoning or charging to one&#x27;s account. It makes no difference, so far as the meaning of imputation is concerned, who it is that imputes, whether man (1Sa 22:15) or God (Ps 32:2); it makes no difference what is imputed, whether a good deed for reward (Ps 106:30 f) or a bad deed for punishment (Le 17:4); and it makes no difference whether that which is imputed is something which is personally one&#x27;s own prior to the imputation, as in the case above cited, where his own good deed was imputed to Phinehas (Ps 106:30 f), or something which is not personally one&#x27;s own prior to the imputation, as where Paul asks that a debt not personally his own be charged to him (Phm 1:18). In all these cases the act of imputation is simply the charging of one with something. It denotes just what we mean by our ordinary use of the term. It does not change the inward state or character of the person to whom something is imputed. When, for example, we say that we impute bad motives to anyone, we do not mean that we make such a one bad; and just so in the Scripture the phrase &quot;to impute iniquity&quot; does not mean to make one personally bad, but simply to lay iniquity to his charge. Hence, when God is said &quot;to impute sin&quot; to anyone, the meaning is that God accounts such a one...</p>

          <p>A principal thing to notice about this preposition, which in the King James Version represents about 16 Hebrew and as many Greek words and prepositions, is that, in hundreds of cases (especially in the Old Testament, but frequently also in the New Testament) in the Revised Version (British and American) the rendering is changed to more exact forms (&quot;to,&quot; &quot;unto,&quot; &quot;by,&quot; &quot;upon,&quot; &quot;at,&quot; &quot;with,&quot; &quot;among,&quot; &quot;for,&quot; &quot;throughout,&quot; etc.; compare e.g. Ge 6:16; 13:8; 17:7,9,12; 18:1; Ex 8:17; Le 1:9, etc.); while, nearly as often, &quot;in&quot; is substituted for divergent forms of the King James Version (e.g. Ge 2:14; 17:11; 31:54; 40:7; 49:17; Ex 8:14,24; Le 3:17; 4:2, etc.). The chief Greek preposition en, is frequently adhered to as &quot;in&quot; in the Revised Version (British and American) where the King James Version has other forms (&quot;with,&quot; &quot;among,&quot; etc.; compare &quot;in&quot; for &quot;with&quot; in John&#x27;s baptism, Mt 3:11, and parallel; &quot;in the tombs&quot; for &quot;among the tombs,&quot; Mr 5:3). In 2Th 2:2, &quot;shaken in mind&quot; in the King James Version is more correctly rendered in the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;shaken from (apo) your mind.&quot; There are numerous such instructive changes.James Orr</p>

          <h3>IN THE LORD</h3>
          <p>(en Kurio): A favorite Pauline expression, denoting that intimate union and fellowship of the Christian with the Lord Jesus Christ which supplies the basis of all Christian relations and conduct, and the distinctive element in which the Christian life has its specific character. Compare the synonymous Pauline phrases, &quot;in Christ,&quot; &quot;in Christ Jesus,&quot; and the Johannine expressions, &quot;being in Christ,&quot; &quot;abiding in Christ.&quot; &quot;In the Lord&quot; denotes: (1) the motive, quality, or character of a Christian duty or virtue, as based on union with Christ, e.g. &quot;Free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord&quot; (1Co 7:39), i.e. provided the marriage be consistent with the Christian life. Compare 1Co 15:58; Php 3:1; 4:1,2,4,10; Eph 6:1,10; Col 3:18, etc.; (2) the ground of Christian unity, fellowship, and brotherly salutation, e.g. Ro 16:2,8,22; 1Co 16:19; Col 4:7; (3) it is often practically synonymous with &quot;Christian&quot; (noun or adjective), &quot;as Christians&quot; or &quot;as a Christian,&quot; e.g. &quot;Salute them of the household of Narcissus, that are in the Lord,&quot; i.e. that are Christians (Ro 16:11); &quot;I .... the prisoner in the Lord,&quot; i.e. the Christian prisoner (Eph 4:1); compare Ro 16:13; 1Co 9:1,2; Eph 6:21 (&quot;faithful minister in the Lord&quot; = faithful Christian minister); Col 4:17 (see Grimm-Thayer, Lex. of New Testament, en, I, 6).D.

          <h3>INCENSE</h3>
          <p>in&#x27;-sens (qeTorah; in Jer 44:21, qiTTer; in Mal 1:11, qaTar, &quot;In every place incense shall be offered unto my name&quot;; the word lebhonah, translated &quot;incense&quot; in several passages in Isa and Jer in the King James Version, is properly &quot;frankincense,&quot; and is so rendered in the Revised Version (British and American)): The offering of incense, or burning of aromatic substances, is common in the religious ceremonies of nearly all nations (Egyptians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Phoenicians, etc.), and it is natural to find it holding a prominent place in the tabernacle and temple-worship of Israel. The newer critical theory that incense was a late importation into the religion of Israel, and that the altar of incense described in Ex 30:1 ff is a post-exilian invention, rests on presuppositions which are not here admitted, and is in contradiction to the express notices of the altar of incense in 1Ki 6:20,22; 7:48; 9:25; compare 2Ch 4:19 (see discussion of the subject by Delitzsch in Luthardt&#x27;s Zeitschrift, 1880, 113 ff). In the denunciation of Eli in 1Sa 2:27 ff, the burning of incense is mentioned as one of the functions of the priesthood (2:28). The &quot;smoke&quot; that filled the temple in Isaiah&#x27;s vision (Isa 6:4) may be presumed to be the smoke of incense. The word keTorah itself properly denotes. &quot;smoke.&quot; For the altar of incense see the article on that subject, and TABERNACLE and TEMPLE. The incense used in the tabernacle service--called &quot;sweet incense&quot; (keToreth ha-cammim, Ex 25:6, etc.)--was compounded according to a definite prescription of the perfumes, stacte, onycha, galbanum and pure frankincense (Ex 30:34 f), and incense not so compounded was rejected as &quot;strange incense&quot; (keTorah zarah, Ex 30:9). In the offering of incense, burning coals from the altar of burnt offering were borne in a censer and put upon the altar of incense (the &quot;golden altar&quot; before the oracle), then the fragrant incense was sprinkled on the fire (compare Lu 1:9 f). Ample details of the rabbinical rules about incense may be seen in the article &quot;Incense,&quot; in DB.See CENSER.Figuratively, incense was symbolical of ascending prayer. The multitude were praying while Zacharias offered incense (Lu 1:10, thumiama), and in Re 5:8; 8:3 f, the incense in the heavenly temple is connected and even identified (5:8) with &quot;the prayers of the saints.&quot;James Orr</p>

          <h3>INDIA</h3>
          <p>in&#x27;-di-a (hoddu: he Indike): The name occurs in canonical Scripture only in Es 1:1; 8:9, of the country which marked the eastern boundary of the territory of Ahasuerus. The Hebrew word comes from the name of the Indus, Hondu, and denotes, not the peninsula of Hindustan, but the country drained by that great river. This is the meaning also in 1 Esdras 3:2; Additions to Esther 3:2; 16:1. Many have thought that this country is intended by Havilah in Ge 2:11 and that the Indus is the Pishon. The drivers of the elephants (1 Macc 6:37) were doubtless natives of this land. The name in 1 Macc 8:9 is certainly an error. India never formed part of the dominions of Antiochus the Great. It may possibly be a clerical error for &quot;Ionia,&quot; as Media is possibly a mistake for Mysia. If the Israelites in early times had no direct relations with India, many characteristic Indian products seem to have found their way into Palestinian markets by way of the Arabian and Syrian trade routes, or by means of the Red Sea fleets (1Ki 10:11,15; Eze 27:15 ff, etc.). Among these may be noted &quot;horns of ivory and ebony,&quot; &quot;cassia and calamus,&quot; almug (sandalwood), apes and peacocks.W. Ewing</p>

In both passages the English Revised Version and the American Standard Revised Version have &quot;unbeliever&quot; in harmony with numerous other instances of the use of the Greek apistos. The word nowhere corresponds to the modern conception of an infidel, one who denies the existence of God, or repudiates the Christian faith; but always signifies one who has not become a believer in Christ. It was formerly so used in English, and some of the older versions have it in other passages, besides these two. It is not found in the Old Testament, but &quot;infidelity&quot; (incredulity) occurs in 2 Esdras 7:44 (114).William Owen Carver</p>

          <h3>INFINITE; INFINITUDE</h3>
          <p>in&#x27;-fin-it, in-fin&#x27;-i-tud:1. Scripture Use:The word &quot;infinite&quot; occurs 3 times only in the text of the King James Version (Job 22:5; Ps 147:5; Na 3:9) and once in margin (Na 2:9). In Ps 147:5, &quot;His understanding is infinite&quot; it represents the Hebrew &#x27;en micpar, &quot;no number&quot;; in the other passages the Hebrew &#x27;en qets (Job 22:5, of iniquities) and &#x27;en qetseh (Na 3:9, of strength of Ethiopia and Egypt; the King James Version margin 2:9, of &quot;spoil&quot;), meaning &quot;no end.&quot; the Revised Version (British and American), therefore, renders in Job 22:5, &quot;Neither is there any end to thine iniquities,&quot; and drops the marginal reference in Na 2:9.2. Application to God:Ps 147:5 is thus the only passage in which the term is directly applied to God. It there correctly conveys the idea of absence of all limitation. There is nothing beyond the compass of God&#x27;s understanding; or, positively, His understanding embraces everything there is to know. Past, present and future; all things possible and actual; the inmost thoughts and purposes of man, as well as his outward actions, lie bare to God&#x27;s knowledge (Heb 4:13; see OMNISCIENCE).3. Infinity Universally Implied:While, however, the term is not found, the truth that God is infinite, not only in His understanding, but in His being and all His perfections, natural and moral, is one that pervades all Scripture. It could not be otherwise, if God was unoriginated, exalted above all limits of time, space and creaturehood, and dependent only on Himself. The Biblical writers, certainly, are far from thinking in metaphysical categories, or using such terms as &quot;self-existence,&quot; &quot;absoluteness,&quot; &quot;unconditioned&quot; yet the ideas for which these terms stand were all of them attributed in their conceptions to God. They did not, e.g. conceive of God as having been born, or as having a beginning, as the Babylonian and Greek gods had, but thought of Him as the ever-existing One (Ps 90:1,2), and free Creator and Disposer of all that exists. This means that God has self-existence, and for the same reason that He is not bound by His own creation. He must be thought of as raised above all creaturely limits, that is, as infinite.4. Anthropomorphisms:The anthropomorphisms of the Bible, indeed, are often exceedingly naive, as when Yahweh is said to &quot;go down&quot; to see what is being done (Ge 11:5,7; 18:21), or to &quot;repent&quot; of His actions (Ge 6:6); but these representations stand in contexts which show that the authors knew God to be unlimited in time, space, knowledge and power (compare Ge 6:7, God, Creator of all; 11:8,9, universal Ruler; 18:25, universal Judge; Nu 23:19, incapable of repentance, etc.). Like anthropomorphisms are found in De and the Prophets, where it is not doubted that the higher conceptions existed. In this infinity of God is implied His unsearchableness (Job 11:7; Ps 145:3; Ro 11:33); conversely, the latter attribute implies His infinity.5. Infinity a Perfection Not a Quantity:This infinitude of God is displayed in all His attributes--...</p>

          <p>in-fur&#x27;-mi-ti (dawah, chalah, machalah; astheneia): This word is used either in the singular or plural (the latter only in the New Testament) and with somewhat varying signification.(1) As sickness or bodily disease (Joh 5:5; Mt 8:17; Lu 5:15; 8:2; 1Ti 5:23). In the last instance the affections seem to have been dyspeptic, the discomfort of which might be relieved by alcohol, although the disease would not be cured thereby. It is probable that this condition of body produced a certain slackness in Timothy&#x27;s work against which Paul several times cautions him. In Lu 7:21 the Revised Version (British and American) has &quot;diseases,&quot; which is a better rendering of the Greek noson, used here, than the King James Version &quot;infirmities.&quot;(2) Imperfections or weaknesses of body (Ro 6:19; 2Co 11:30 the King James Version; 2Co 12:5,9,10 the King James Version; Ga 4:13).(3) Moral or spiritual weaknesses and defects (Ps 77:10; Ro 8:26; 15:1; Heb 4:15; 5:2; 7:28). In this sense it is often used by the classic English writers, as in Milton&#x27;s &quot;the last infirmity of noble minds&quot;; compare Caesar, IV, iii, 86. The infirmity which a man of resolution can keep under by his will (Pr 18:14) may be either moral or physical. In Lu 13:11 the woman&#x27;s physical infirmity is ascribed to the influence of an evil spirit.Alexander Macalister</p>

And in the figurative and poetical sense, the expression is applied to the kingdom of God as represented in the consecrated lives of His followers. In a similar sense, the Psalmist is represented as speaking of the Lord as the portion of his inheritance. In addition to the above word, the King James Version translations as inheritance, morashah, &quot;a possession,&quot; &quot;heritage&quot; (De 33:4; Eze 33:24); yerushshah, &quot;something occupied,&quot; &quot;a patrimony,&quot; &quot;possession&quot; (Jud 21:17); cheleq, &quot;smoothness,&quot; &quot;allotment&quot; (Ps 16:5); kleronomeo, &quot;to inherit&quot; (Mt 5:5, etc.); kleronomos, &quot;heir&quot; (Mt 21:38, etc.); kleronomia, &quot;heirship,&quot; &quot;patrimony, &quot;possession&quot;; or kleros, &quot;an acquisition&quot; &quot;portion,&quot; &quot;heritage,&quot; from kleroo, &quot;to assign,&quot; &quot;to allot,&quot; &quot;to obtain an inheritance&quot; (Mt 21:38; Lu 12:13; Ac 7:5; 20:32; 26:18; Ga 3:18; Eph 1:11,14,18; 5:5; Col 1:12; 3:24; Heb 1:4; 9:15; 11:8; 1Pe 1:4).The Pentateuch distinguishes clearly between real and personal property, the fundamental idea regarding the former being the thought that the land is God&#x27;s, given by Him to His children, the people of Israel, and hence, cannot be alienated (Le 25:23,28). In order that there might not be any respecter of persons in the division, the lot was to determine the specific piece to be owned by each family head (Nu 26:52-56; 33:54). In case, through necessity of circumstances, a homestead was sold, the title could pass only temporarily; for in the year of Jubilee every homestead must again return to the original owner or heir (Le 25:25-34). Real estate given to the priesthood must be appraised, and could be redeemed by the payment of the appraised valuation, thus preventing the transfer of real property even in this case (Le 27:14-25). Inheritance was controlled by the following regulations:(1) The firstborn son inherited a double portion of all the father&#x27;s possession (De 21:15-17);(2) the daughters were entitled to an inheritance, provided there were no sons in the family (Nu 27:8);(3) in case there were no direct heirs, the brothers or more distant kinsmen were recognized (27:9-11); in no case should an estate pass from one tribe to another.The above points were made the subject of statutory law at the instance of the daughters of Zelophehad, the entire case being clearly set forth in Nu 27; 36.Frank E.

          <h3>INIQUITY</h3>
          <p>in-ik&#x27;-wi-ti (`awon; anomia): In the Old Testament of the 11 words translated &quot;iniquity,&quot; by far the most common and important is `awon (about 215 times). Etymologically, it is customary to explain it as meaning literally &quot;crookedness,&quot; &quot;perverseness,&quot; i.e. evil regarded as that which is not straight or upright, moral distortion (from `iwwah, &quot;to bend,&quot; &quot;make crooked,&quot; &quot;pervert&quot;). Driver, however (following Lagarde), maintains that two roots, distinct in Arabic, have been confused in Hebrew, one equals &quot;to bend,&quot; &quot;pervert&quot; (as above), and the other equals &quot;to err,&quot; &quot;go astray&quot;; that `awon is derived from the latter, and consequently expresses the idea of error, deviation from the right path, rather than that of perversion (Driver, Notes on Sam, 135 note) Whichever etymology is adopted, in actual usage it has three meanings which almost imperceptibly pass into each other:(1) iniquity,(2) guilt of iniquity,(3) punishment of iniquity.Primarily, it denotes &quot;not an action, but the character of an action&quot; (Oehler), and is so distinguished from &quot;sin&quot; (chaTTa&#x27;th). Hence, we have the expression &quot;the iniquity of my sin&quot; (Ps 32:5). Thus the meaning glides into that of &quot;guilt,&quot; which might often take the place of &quot;iniquity&quot; as the translation of `awon (Ge 15:16; Ex 34:7; Jer 2:22, etc.). From &quot;guilt&quot; it again passes into the meaning of &quot;punishment of guilt,&quot; just as Latin piaculum may denote both guilt and its punishment. The transition is all the easier in Hebrew because of the Hebrew sense of the intimate relation of sin and suffering, e.g. Ge 4:13, &quot;My punishment is greater than I can bear&quot;; which is obviously to be preferred to King James Version margin, the Revised Version, margin &quot;Mine iniquity is greater than can be forgiven,&quot; for Cain is not so much expressing sorrow for his sin, as complaining of the severity of his punishment; compare 2Ki 7:9 (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;punishment,&quot; the Revised Version margin &quot;iniquity&quot;); Isa 5:18 (where for &quot;iniquity&quot; we might have &quot;punishment of iniquity,&quot; as in Le 26:41,43, etc.); Isa 40:2 (&quot;iniquity,&quot; the Revised Version margin &quot;punishment&quot;). The phrase &quot;bear iniquity&quot; is a standing expression for bearing its consequences, i.e. its penalty; generally of the sinner bearing the results of his own iniquity (Le 17:16; 20:17,19; Nu 14:34; Eze 44:10, etc.), but sometimes of one bearing the iniquity of another vicariously, and so taking it away (e.g. Eze 4:4 f; 18:19 f). Of special interest in the latter sense are the sufferings of the Servant of Yahweh, who shall &quot;bear the iniquities&quot; of the people (Isa 53:11; compare Isa 53:6).Other words frequently translated &quot;iniquity&quot; are: &#x27;awen, literally, &quot;worthlessness,&quot; &quot;vanity,&quot; hence, &quot;naughtiness,&quot; &quot;mischief&quot; (47 times in the King James Version, especially in the phrase &quot;workers of iniquity,&quot; Job 4:8; Ps 5:5; 6:8; Pr 10:29, etc.); `awel and `awlah, literally, &quot;perverseness&quot; (De 32:4; Job 6:29 the King James Version, etc.).In the New Testament &quot;iniquity&quot; st...</p>

          <h3>INK</h3>
          <p>ink (deyo, from root meaning &quot;slowly flowing,&quot; BDB, 188; melan, &quot;black&quot;): Any fluid substance used with pen or brush to form written characters. In this sense ink is mentioned once in the Hebrew Bible (Jer 36:2) and 3 times in the Greek New Testament (2Co 3:3; 2 Joh 1:12; 3 Joh 1:13), and it is implied in all references to writing on papyrus or on leather. The inference from the &quot;blotting out&quot; of Ex 32:33 and Nu 5:23 that the Hebrew ink was a lamp-black and gum, or some other dry ink, is confirmed by the general usage of antiquity, by the later Jewish prejudice against other inks (OTJC, 71 note) and by a Jewish receipt referring to ink-tablets (Drach, &quot;Notice sur l&#x27;encre des Hebreux,&quot; Ann. philos. chret., 42, 45, 353). The question is, however, now being put on a wholly new basis by the study of the Elephantine Jewish documents (Meyer, Papyrusfund2, 1912, 15, 21), and above all of the Harvard Ostraca from Samaria which give actual specimens of the ink in Palestine in the time of Ahab (Harvard Theological Review, Jan. 1911, 136-43). It is likely, however, that during the long period of Bible history various inks were used. The official copy of the law in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus was, according to Josephus (Ant., XII, ii, 11), written in gold, and the vermilion and red paints and dyes mentioned in Jer 22:14; Eze 23:14, and The Wisdom of Solomon 13:14 (milto kai phukei) were probably used also for writing books or coloring incised inscriptions.

          <p>ink&#x27;-horn (keceth equals keseth, BDB, 903): This term &quot;inkhorn&quot; occurs 3 times in Eze 9 (9:2,3,11), in the phrase &quot;writer&#x27;s inkhorn upon his loins&quot; (or &quot;by his side&quot;). The word is more exactly &quot;implement case,&quot; or &quot;writing-case&quot; (calamarium atramentarium, theca calamaria, theca libraria, graphiaria). This may have been the Egyptian palette (Budge, Mummy, 350-52) seen so often in the monuments of all periods, or the later form of pen-case with ink-well attached, which is a modified form adapted for ink carried in fluid form. The Egyptian palette was carried characteristically over the shoulder or under the arm, neither of which methods is strictly &quot;upon the loins.&quot; The manner of carrying, therefore, was doubtless in the girdle, as in modern oriental usage (Benzinger, Hebrew Archaeol., 185). A good example of the pen-case and inkwell writing-case (given also in Garucci, Daremberg-Saglio, Gardthausen, etc.) is given from the original in Birt, Die Buchrolle in der Kunst, 220, and is reproduced (a) in this article, together with (b) an Egyptian palette. Whether the form of Ezekiel&#x27;s case approached the palette or the ink-well type probably depends on the question of whether dry ink or fluid ink was used in Ezekiel&#x27;s time (see INK).

          <h3>INN</h3>
          <p>(malon; pandocheion, kataluma):1. Earliest Night Resting-Places:The Hebrew word malon means literally, a &quot;night resting-place,&quot; and might be applied to any spot where caravans (Ge 42:27; 43:21 the King James Version), individuals (Ex 4:24; Jer 9:2), or even armies (Jos 4:3,8; 2Ki 19:23; Isa 10:29) encamped for the night. In the slightly altered form melunah, the same word is used of a nightwatchman&#x27;s lodge in a garden (Isa 1:8; 24:20, the King James Version &quot;cottage&quot;). The word in itself does not imply the presence of any building, and in the case of caravans and travelers was doubtless originally, as very often at the present day, only a convenient level bit of ground near some spring, where baggage might be unloaded, animals watered and tethered, and men rest on the bare ground. Nothing in the Old Testament suggests the occupancy of a house in such cases. The nearest approach to such an idea occurs in Jer 41:17 margin, where geruth kimham is translated &quot;the lodging-place of Chimham,&quot; but the text is very doubtful and probably refers rather to sheepfolds. We cannot say when buildings were first used, but the need of shelter for caravans traveling in winter, and of protection in dangerous times and districts, would lead to their introduction at an early period in the history of trade.2. Public Inns:It is noteworthy that all the indisputable designations of &quot;inn&quot; come in with the Greek period. Josephus (Ant., XV, v, 1; BJ, I, xxi, 7) speaks of &quot;Public inns&quot; under the name of katagogal, while in the Aramaic Jewish writings we meet with &#x27;ushpiza&#x27;, from Latin hospitium, and &#x27;akhcanya&#x27; from the Greek xenia; the New Testament designation pandocheion has passed into the Aramaic pundheqa&#x27; and the Arabic funduq. All these are used of public inns, and they all correspond to the modern &quot;khan&quot; or &quot;caravanserai.&quot; These are to be found on the great trade routes all over the East. In their most elaborate form they have almost the strength of a fortress. They consist of a great quadrangle into which admission is gained through a broad, strong gateway. The quadrangle is enclosed on all sides by a 2-story building, the windows in the case of the lower story opening only to the interior. The upper story is reached by stairways, and has a gangway all around, giving access to the practically bare rooms which are at the disposal of travelers. 3. Their Evil Name:There is usually a well of good water in the center of the quadrangle, and travelers as a rule bring their own food and often that of their animals (Jud 19:19) with them. There are no fixed payments, and on departure, the arranging of haqq el-khan generally means a disagreeable dispute, as the innkeepers are invariably untruthful, dishonest and oppressive. They have ever been regarded as of infamous character. The Roman laws in many places recognize this. In Mishna, Yebhamoth, xvi. 7 the word of an innkeeper was doubted, and Mishna, `Abbodhah Zarah, ii.4 places them in the lowest scale of degradation. The New T...</p>

          <p>in&#x27;-o-sens, in&#x27;-o-sen-si, in&#x27;-o-sent (zakhu, niqqayon, chinnam, chaph, naqi; athoos): the King James Version and the American Standard Revised Version have innocency in Ge 20:5; Ps 26:6; 73:13; Da 6:22; Ho 8:5. In Daniel the Hebrew is zakhu, and the innocence expressed is the absence of the guilt of disloyalty to God. In all the other places the Hebrew is niqqayon, and the innocence expressed is the absence of pollution, Hosea having reference to the pollution of idolatry, and the other passages presenting the cleansing under the figure of washing hands. the King James Version has innocent not fewer than 40 times. In one place (1Ki 2:31) the Hebrew is chinnam, meaning &quot;undeserved,&quot; or &quot;without cause,&quot; and, accordingly, the American Standard Revised Version, instead of &quot;innocent blood .... shed,&quot; has &quot;blood .... shed without cause.&quot; In another place (Job 33:9) the Hebrew is chaph, meaning &quot;scraped,&quot; or &quot;polished,&quot; therefore &quot;clean,&quot; and refers to moral purity. In all the other places the Hebrew is naqi, or its cognates, and the idea is doubtless the absence of pollution. In more than half the passages &quot;innocent&quot; is connected with blood, as &quot;blood of the innocent,&quot; or simply &quot;innocent blood.&quot; In some places there is the idea of the Divine acquittal, or forgiveness, as in Job 9:28: &quot;I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent&quot; (compare Job 10:14, where the same Hebrew word is used). The New Testament has &quot;innocent&quot; twice in connection with blood--&quot;innocent blood,&quot; and &quot;innocent of the blood&quot; (Mt 27:4,24).E. J. Forrester</p>

Corollaries from Above Facts3. Marks of HistoricityI. Meaning and History of the Term.The conventional, ecclesiastical name given to the slaughter by HEROD, I (which see) of children two years old and under in Bethlehem and its environs at the time of the birth of Christ (Mt 2:16). The accepted title for this event may be traced through Augustine to Cyprian.Irenaeus (died 202 AD) calls these children &quot;martyrs,&quot; and in a very beautiful passage interprets the tragedy which ended their brief lives as a gracious and tender &quot;sending before&quot; into His kingdom by the Lord Himself.Cyprian (died 258 AD) says: &quot;That it might be manifest that they who are slain for Christ&#x27;s sake are innocent, innocent infancy was put to death for his name&#x27;s sake&quot; (Ep. lv. 6).Augustine (born 354 AD), following Cyprian, speaks of the children, formally, as &quot;the Innocents&quot; (Commentary on Ps 43:5).The ecclesiastical treatment of the incident is remarkable because of the exaggeration which was indulged in as to the extent of the massacre and the number of victims. At an early date the Greek church canonized 14,000, and afterward, by a curious misinterpretation of Re 14:1,3, the number was increased to 144,000.According to Milman the liturgy of the Church of England retains a reminiscence of this ancient error in the use of Re 14 on Holy Innocents&#x27; Day (see History of Christianity, I, 107, note e). This exaggeration, of which there is no hint in the New Testament, is worthy of note because the most serious general argument against the historicity of the narrative is drawn from the silence of Josephus. As in all probability there could not have been more than twenty children involved (compare Farrar, Life of Christ, I, 45, note), the incident could not have bulked very largely in the series of horrors perpetrated or planned by Herod in the last months of his life (see Farrar, The Herods, 144 f) .II. Analysis of Narrative with Special Reference to Motive.In estimating the value of such a narrative from the viewpoint of historicity, the first and most important step is to gauge the motive. Why was the story told? This question is not always easy to answer, but in the present instance there is a very simple and effective test at hand.1. Focus of Narrative--Residence at Nazareth:In Matthew&#x27;s infancy section (Mt 1; 2) there are five quotations from the Old Testament which are set into the narrative of events. These five quotations represent the cardinal and outstanding points of interest. The quotations are placed thus:(1) at the Virgin Birth (Mt 1:23);(2) at the birth at Bethlehem (Mt 2:6);(3) at the visit to Egypt (Mt 2:15);(4) at the murder of the children (Mt 2:18);(5) at the Nazareth residence (Mt 2:23).It will be noticed at once as peculiar and significant that no quotation is attached to the visit of the Magi.

          <p>in-kwir&#x27; (sha&#x27;al, &quot;to ask,&quot; &quot;desire&quot;; zeteo, &quot;to seek&quot;); A form sometimes employed with reference to the practice of divination, as where Saul &quot;inquires of&quot; (or &quot;consults&quot;) the witch of Endor as to the issue of the coming battle (1Sa 28:6,7) (see DIVINATION).In Job 10:6, &quot;to inquire (baqash) after iniquity&quot; signifies to bring to light and punish for it, and Job asks distractedly if God&#x27;s time is so short that He is in a hurry to find him guilty and to punish him as if He had only a man&#x27;s few days to live.&quot;To inquire of Yahweh&quot; denotes the consultation of oracle, priest, prophet or Yahweh Himself, as to a certain course of action or as to necessary supplies. (Jud 20:27 the King James Version, &quot;to ask&quot;; 1Ki 22:5; 1Sa 9:9 (darash); 1Sa 10:22 the King James Version; 2Sa 2:1; 5:19,23; Eze 36:37).&quot;To inquire (baqar) in his temple&quot; (palace) means to find out all that constant fellowship or unbroken intercourse with God can teach (Ps 27:4).Pr 20:25 warns against rashness in making a vow and afterward considering (baqar, &quot;to make inquiry&quot;) as to whether it can be fulfilled or how it may be eluded.In the King James Version, the translation of several Greek words: diaginosko, &quot;to know thoroughly&quot; (Ac 23:15); epizeteo, &quot;to seek after&quot; (Ac 19:39); suzeteo, &quot;to seek together&quot; (Lu 22:23); exetazo, &quot;to search out&quot; (Mt 10:11).M.

          <h3>INSECTS</h3>
          <p>in&#x27;-sekts: In English Versions of the Bible, including the marginal notes, we find at least 23 names of insects or words referring to them: ant, bald locust, bee, beetle, cankerworm, caterpillar, creeping thing, cricket, crimson, flea, fly, gnat, grasshopper, honey, hornet, locust, louse, (lice), moth, palmer-worm, sandfly, scarlet-worm, silk-worm. These can be referred to about 12 insects, which, arranged systematically, are: Hymenoptera, ant, bee, hornet; Lepidoptera, clothes-moth, silk-worm; Siphonaptera, flea; Diptera, fly; Rhynchota, louse, scarletworm; Orthoptera, several kinds of grasshoppers and locusts.The word &quot;worm&quot; refers not only to the scarletworm, but to various larvae of Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Diptera. &quot;Creeping things&quot; refers indefinitely to insects, reptiles, and beasts. In the list of 23 names given above honey and bee refer to one insect, as do crimson and scarlet. Sandfly has no place if &quot;lice&quot; be retained in Ex 8:16 ff. Bald locust, beetle, canker-worm, cricket, and palmerworm probably all denote various kinds of grasshoppers and locusts. When the translators of English Versions of the Bible had to do with two or more Hebrew words for which there was only one well-recognized English equivalent, they seem to have been content with that alone, if the two Hebrew words occurred in different passages; e.g. zebhubh, &quot;fly&quot; (Ec 10:1; Isa 7:18), and `arobh, &quot;fly&quot; (Ex 8:21). On the other hand, they were put to it to find equivalents for the insect names in Le 11:22; Joe 1:4, and elsewhere. For cale&#x27;am (Le 11:22) they evidently coined &quot;bald locust,&quot; following a statement of the Talmud that it had a smooth head. For gazam and yeleq they imported &quot;palmer-worm&quot; and &quot;canker-worm,&quot; two old English names of caterpillars, using &quot;caterpillar&quot; for chasil. The King James Version &quot;beetle&quot; for chargol is absolutely inappropriate, and the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;cricket,&quot; while less objectionable, is probably also incorrect. The English language seems to lack appropriate names for different kinds of grasshoppers and locusts, and it is difficult to suggest any names to take the places of those against which these criticisms are directed. See under the names of the respective insects. See also SCORPION and SPIDER, which are not included here because they are not strictly insects.Alfred Ely Day</p>

Scripture of the New Testament Writers Was the Old Testament18. Inclusion of the New TestamentLITERATURE1. Meaning of Terms:The word &quot;inspire&quot; and its derivatives seem to have come into Middle English from the French, and have been employed from the first (early in the 14th century) in a considerable number of significations, physical and metaphorical, secular and religious. The derivatives have been multiplied and their applications extended during the procession of the years, until they have acquired a very wide and varied use. Underlying all their use, however, is the constant implication of an influence from without, producing in its object movements and effects beyond its native, or at least its ordinary powers. The noun &quot;inspiration,&quot; although already in use in the 14th century, seems not to occur in any but a theological sense until late in the 16th century. The specifically theological sense of all these terms is governed, of course, by their usage in Latin theology; and this rests ultimately on their employment in the Latin Bible. In the Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) Latin Bible the verb inspiro (Ge 2:7; The Wisdom of Solomon 15:11; Ecclesiasticus 4:12; 2Ti 3:16; 2Pe 1:21) and the noun inspiratio (2Sa 22:16; Job 32:8; Ps 18:15; Ac 17:25) both occur 4 or 5 times in somewhat diverse applications. In the development of a theological nomenclature, however, they have acquired (along with other less frequent applications) a technical sense with reference to the Biblical writers or the Biblical books. The Biblical books are called inspired as the Divinely determined products of inspired men; the Biblical writers are called inspired as breathed into by the Holy Spirit, so that the product of their activities transcends human powers and becomes Divinely authoritative. Inspiration is, therefore, usually defined as a supernatural influence exerted on the sacred writers by the Spirit of God, by virtue of which their writings are given Divine trustworthiness.2. Occurrences in the Bible:Meanwhile, for English-speaking men, these terms have virtually ceased to be Biblical terms. They naturally passed from the Latin Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) into the English versions made from it (most fully into the Rheim...</p>

          <h3>INTEGRITY</h3>
          <p>in-teg&#x27;-ri-ti (tom, tummah): The translation of tom, &quot;simplicity,&quot; &quot;soundness,&quot; &quot;completeness,&quot; rendered also &quot;upright,&quot; &quot;perfection.&quot; Its original sense appears in the phrase letom (1Ki 22:34; 2Ch 18:33), &quot;A certain man drew his bow at a venture&quot; margin &quot;Hebrew, in his simplicity&quot; (compare 2Sa 15:11, &quot;in their simplicity&quot;). It is translated &quot;integrity&quot; (Ge 20:5,6; 1Ki 9:4; Ps 7:8; 25:21; 26:1,11; 41:12; 78:72; Pr 19:1; 20:7), in all which places it seems to carry the meaning of simplicity, or sincerity of heart and intention, truthfulness, uprightness. In the plural (tummim) it is one of the words on the breastplate of the high priest (Ex 28:30; De 33:8; Ezr 2:63; Ne 7:65), one of the sacred lots, indicating, perhaps, &quot;innocence&quot; or &quot;integrity&quot; Septuagint aletheia). See URIM AND THUMMIM. Another word translated &quot;integrity&quot; is tummah, from tamam, &quot;to complete,&quot; &quot;be upright,&quot; &quot;perfect,&quot; only in Job 2:3,1; 27:5; 31:6; Pr 11:3.The word &quot;integrity&quot; does not occur in the New Testament, but its equivalents may be seen in &quot;sincerity,&quot; &quot;truth,&quot; the &quot;pure heart,&quot; the &quot;single eye,&quot; etc. In the above sense of simplicity of intention it is equivalent to being honest, sincere, genuine, and is fundamental to true character.W.

          <p>in-ter-sesh&#x27;-un (pagha`, &quot;to make intercession&quot;; originally &quot;to strike upon,&quot; or &quot;against&quot;; then in a good sense, &quot;to assail anyone with petitions,&quot; &quot;to urge,&quot; and when on behalf of another, &quot;to intercede&quot; (Ru 1:16; Jer 7:16; 27:18; Job 21:15; Ge 23:8; Isa 53:12; Jer 36:25). A similar idea is found in enteuxis, used as &quot;petition,&quot; and in the New Testament &quot;intercession.&quot; The English word is derived from Latin intercedo, &quot;to come between,&quot; which strangely has the somewhat opposed meanings of &quot;obstruct&quot; and &quot;to interpose on behalf of&quot; a person, and finally &quot;to intercede.&quot; The growth of meaning in this word in the various languages is highly suggestive.

INTERCESSION PERFECTED IN CHRIST&#x27;S OFFICE AND IN THE CHURCHIII. INTERCESSION OF THE HOLY SPIRITEtymology and Meaning of Term:The meaning of the word is determined by its use in 1Ti 2:1, &quot;I exhort, therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all and men&quot;; where the different kinds of prayers appear to be distinguished. Considerable discussion has arisen on the exact meaning of these words. Augustine refers them to the liturgy of the Eucharist. This seems to be importing the significance of the various parts of the ceremony as observed at a time much later than the date of the passage in question. &quot;Supplications&quot; and &quot;prayers&quot; refer to general and specific petitions; &quot;intercessions&quot; will then have the meaning of a request concerning others.Intercession is prayer on behalf of another, and naturally arises from the instinct of the human heart--not merely prompted by affection and interest, but recognizing that God&#x27;s relation to man is not merely individual, but social. Religion thus involves man&#x27;s relations to his fellow-man, just as in man&#x27;s social position intercession with one on behalf of another is a common incident, becoming, in the development of society, the function of appointed officials; as in legal and courtly procedure, so in religion, the spontaneous and affectionate prayer to God on behalf of another grows into the regular and orderly service of a duly appointed priesthood. Intercession is thus to be regarded:(1) as the spontaneous act of man for his fellowman;(2) the official act of developed sacerdotalism;(3) the perfecting of the natural movement of humanity, and the ty...</p>

          <h3>INTERCESSION OF CHRIST</h3>
          <p>The general conception of our Lord&#x27;s mediatorial office is specially summed up in His intercession in which He appears in His high-priestly office, and also as interceding with the Father on behalf of that humanity whose cause He had espoused.1. Christ&#x27;s Intercession Viewed in Its Priestly Aspect:The function of priesthood as developed under Judaism involved the position of mediation between man and God. The priest represented man, and on man&#x27;s behalf approached God; thus he offered sacrifice, interceded and gave to the offerer whom he represented the benediction and expression of the Divine acceptance. (For the various forms of these offerings, see special articles.) As in sacrifice, so in the work of Christ, we find the proprietary rights of the offerer in the sacrifice. For man, Christ as one with man, and yet in His own personal right, offers Himself (see Ro 5; and compare Ga 4:5 with Heb 2:11). There was also the transfer of guilt and its conditions, typically by laying the hand on the head of the animal, which then bore the sins of the offerer and was presented to God by the priest. The acknowledgment of sin and the surrender to God is completely fulfilled in Christ&#x27;s offering of Himself, and His death (compare Le 3:2,8,13; 16:21; with Isa 53:6; 2Co 5:21). our Lord&#x27;s intercessory quality in the sacrifice of Himself is not only indicated by the imputation of guilt to Him as representing the sinner, but also in the victory of His life over death, which is then given to man in God&#x27;s acceptance of His representative and substitute.In the Epistle to the Hebrews, the intercessory character of our Lord&#x27;s high-priestly office is transferred to the heavenly condition and work of Christ, where the relation of Christ&#x27;s work to man&#x27;s condition is regarded as being still continued in the heavenly place (see Heb 9:11-28). This entrance into heaven is once for all, and in the person of the high priest the way is open to the very presence of God. From one point of view (Heb 10:12) the priestly service of the Lord was concluded and gathered up into His kingly office (Heb 10:13,14-18). But from another point of view, we ourselves are bidden to enter into the Holiest Place; as if in union with Christ we too become a kingly priesthood (Heb 10:19-22; and compare 1Pe 2:9).It must not be forgotten, however, that this right of entrance into the most Holy Place is one that depends entirely upon our vital union with Christ, He appears in heaven for us and we with Him, and in this sense He fulfills the second duty of His high-priestly office as intercessor, with the added conception drawn from the legal advocacy of the Roman court. The term translated &quot;Advocate&quot; in 1 Joh 2:2 is parakletos, which in Joh 14:16 is translated &quot;Comforter.&quot; The word is of familiar use in Greek for the legal advocate or patronus who appeared on behalf of his client. Thus, in the double sense of priestly and legal representative, our Lord is our intercessor in Heaven.Of the modes in which Ch...</p>

          <h3>INTEREST</h3>
          <p>in&#x27;-ter-est (neshekh, mashsha&#x27;; tokos): The Hebrew word neshekh is from a root which means &quot;to bite&quot;; thus interest is &quot;something bitten off.&quot; The other word, mashsa&#x27;, means &quot;lending on interest.&quot; The Greek term is from the root tikto, &quot;to produce&quot; or &quot;beget,&quot; hence, interest is something begotten or produced by money. The Hebrew words are usually translated &quot;usury,&quot; but this meant the same as interest, all interest being reckoned as usury.Long before Abraham&#x27;s time money had been loaned at a fixed rate of interest in Babylonia and almost certainly in Egypt. The Code of Hammurabi gives regulations regarding the lending and borrowing of money, the usual interest being 20 percent. Sometimes it was only 11 2/3 and 13 1/3, as shown by contract tablets. In one case, if the loan was not paid in two months, 18 per cent interest would be charged. Corn (grain), dates, onions, etc., were loaned at interest. Thus Moses and Israel would be familiar with commercial loans and interest. In Israel there was no system of credit or commercial loans in Moses&#x27; time and after. A poor man borrowed because he was poor. The law of Moses (Ex 22:25) forbade loaning at interest. There was to be no creditor and no taker of interest among them (Le 25:36,37). De permits them to lend on interest to a foreigner (De 23:19,20), but not to a brother Israelite. That this was considered the proper thing in Israel for centuries is seen in Ps 15:5, while Pr 28:8 implies that it was an unusual thing, interest being generally exacted and profit made. Ezekiel condemns it as a heinous sin (Eze 18:8,13,17) and holds up the ideal of righteousness as not taking interest (22:12). Isa 24:2 implies that it was a business in that age, the lender and borrower being social types. Jeremiah implies that there was not always the best feeling between lenders and borrowers (15:10). According to Ne 5:7,10, rich Jews were lending to others and exacting heavy interest. Nehemiah condemns such conduct and forbids its continuance, citing himself as an example of lending without interest. The lenders restored 1 percent of that exacted.In the New Testament, references to interest occur in the parable of the Pounds (Lu 19:23) and of the Talents (Mt 25:27). Here the men were expected to put their master&#x27;s money out at interest, and condemnation followed the failure to do so. Thus the principle of receiving interest is not condemned in the Old Testament, only it was not to be taken from a brother Israelite. In the New Testament it is distinctly encouraged.See also USURY.J. J. Reeve</p>

          <h3>INTERPRETATION</h3>
          <p>in-tur-pre-ta&#x27;-shun:1. General Principles:Is a generic term and may refer to any work of literature. Referred specifically to the sacred Scriptures, the science of interpretation is generally known as hermeneutics, while the practical application of the principles of this science is exegesis. In nearly all cases, interpretation has in mind the thoughts of another, and then, further, these thoughts expressed in another language than that of the interpreter. In this sense it is used in Biblical research. A person has interpreted the thoughts of another when he has in his own mind a correct reproduction or photograph of the thought as it was conceived in the mind of the original writer or speaker. It is accordingly a purely reproductive process, involving no originality of thought on the part of the interpreter. If the latter adds anything of his own it is eisegesis and not exegesis. The moment the Bible student has in his own mind what was in the mind of the author or authors of the Biblical books when these were written, he has interpreted the thought of the Scriptures.The interpretation of any specimen of literature will depend on the character of the work under consideration. A piece of poetry and a chapter of history will not be interpreted according to the same principles or rules. Particular rules that are legitimate in the explanation of a work of fiction would be entirely out of place in dealing with a record of facts. Accordingly, the rules of the correct interpretation of the Scriptures will depend upon the character of these writings themselves, and the principles which an interpreter will employ in his interpretation of the Scriptures will be in harmony with his ideas of what the Scriptures are as to origin, character, history, etc. In the nature of the case the dogmatical stand of the interpreter will materially influence his hermeneutics and exegesis. In the legitimate sense of the term, every interpreter of the Bible is &quot;prejudiced,&quot; i.e. is guided by certain principles which he holds antecedently to his work of interpretation. If the modern advanced critic is right in maintaining that the Biblical books do not differ in kind or character from the religious books of other ancient peoples, such as the Indians or the Persians, then the same principles that he applies in the case of the Rig Veda or the Zend Avesta he will employ also in his exposition of the Scriptures. If, on the other hand, the Bible is for him a unique collection of writings, Divinely inspired and a revelation from the source of all truth, the Bible student will hesitate long before accepting contradictions, errors, mistakes, etc., in the Scriptures.2. Special Principles:The Scriptures are a Divine and human product combined. That the holy men of God wrote as they were moved by the Spirit is the claim of the Scriptures themselves. Just where the line of demarcation is to be drawn between the human and the Divine factors in the production of the sacred Scriptures mate...</p>

In Ge 25:21 &quot;intreat&quot; is used to indicate the success of a petition. For entreat see Ge 12:16, &quot;He entreated Abraham well&quot;; Ac 27:3, &quot;And Julius courteously entreated Paul&quot; (philanthropos chresamenos, literally, &quot;to use in a philanthropic way&quot;); compare also Jas 3:17, where eupeithes, literally, &quot;easily persuaded,&quot; is translated &quot;easy to be entreated.&quot;The Revised Version changes all passages of the King James Version where &quot;intreat&quot; is found to &quot;entreat,&quot; with the exception of those mentioned below. The meaning of &quot;entreat&quot; is &quot;to ask,&quot; &quot;to beseech,&quot; &quot;to supplicate&quot;: Job 19:17 reads &quot;and my supplication to the children&quot; (hannothi, the King James Version &quot;though I entreated for the children,&quot; the Revised Version, margin &quot;I make supplication&quot;). Jer 15:11 reads, &quot;I will cause the enemy to make supplication&quot; (hiphga&#x27;ti), instead, the King James Version &quot;I will cause the enemy to entreat&quot; (the Revised Version margin &quot;I will intercede for thee with the enemy&quot;). 1Ti 5:1 changes the King James Version &quot;intreat&quot; to &quot;exhort.&quot; Php 4:3 renders the King James Version &quot;entreat&quot; by &quot;beseech.&quot;Russell Benjamin Miller</p>

The Greek original, 5 ho eso (also esothen) anthropos (Ro 7:22) is lexigraphically defined &quot;the internal man,&quot; i.e. &quot;soul,&quot; &quot;conscience.&quot; It is the immaterial part of man--mind, spirit--in distinction from the &quot;outward man&quot; which &quot;perishes&quot; (2Co 4:16 the King James Version). As the seat of spiritual influences it is the sphere in which the Holy Spirit does His renewing and saving work (Eph 3:16). The term &quot;inward man&quot; cannot be used interchangeably with &quot;the new man,&quot; for it may still be &quot;corrupt,&quot; and subject to &quot;vanity&quot; and &quot;alienated from the life of God.&quot; Briefly stated, it is mind, soul, spirit--God&#x27;s image in man--man&#x27;s higher nature, intellectual, moral, and spiritual.Dwight M.

          <p>ir-ha-he&#x27;-rez (`ir haherec, according to the Massoretic Text, Aquila, Theodotion, Septuagint, the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American); according to some Hebrew manuscripts, Symmachus, and the Vulgate, `ir ha-cherec): A city of Egypt referred to in Isa 19:18. Jewish quarrels concerning the temple which Onias built in Egypt have most probably been responsible for the altering of the texts of some of the early manuscripts, and it is not now possible to determine absolutely which have been altered and which accord with the original. This difference in manuscripts gives rise to different opinions among authorities here to be noted. Most of the discussion of this name arises from this uncertainty and is hence rather profitless.The starting-point of any proper discussion of Ir-ha-h is that the words are by Isaiah and that they are prophecy, predictive prophecy. They belong to that portion of the prophecies of Isaiah which by nearly all critics is allowed to the great prophet. Nothing but unfounded speculation or an unwillingness to admit that there is any predictive prophecy can call in question Isaiah&#x27;s authorship of these words. Then the sense of the passage in which these words occur imperatively demands that they be accounted predictive prophecy. Isaiah plainly refers to the future, &quot;shall be called&quot;; and makes a definite statement concerning what shall take place in the future (19:18-24). The reality of predictive prophecy may be discussed by those so inclined, but that the intention of the author here was to utter predictive prophecy does not seem to be open to question. For the verification of this prediction by its fulfillment in history we shall inquire concerning:(1) the times intended: &quot;that day&quot;;(2) the &quot;five cities&quot;;(3) &quot;Ir-ha-heres.&quot;1. The Times Intended: &quot;That Day&quot;:The prophet gives a fairly specific description of &quot;that day.&quot; It was at least to begin when &quot;there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Yahweh of hosts&quot; (Isa 19:18), and &quot;In that day shall there be an altar to Yahweh in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to Yahweh&quot; (Isa 19:19). There was to be also some inroad made upon the heathenism of Egypt by the message of the Lord (Isa 19:21 f), and about that time a deliverer should arise in Egypt (Isa 19:20), and all this should take place before the power of the land of Assyria should pass away (Isa 19:23 f) .2. The &quot;Five Cities&quot;:The first historical fulfillment of these words is found at the period when Onias built his imitation of the Temple of Jerusalem at the place called by the Greeks Leontopolis (Tell el-Yehudiyeh), and the worship of Yahweh was set up at Elephantine, and the Jews were a great power at Alexandria and at Tahpanhes. While any of these latter three might have contained the &quot;pillar,&quot; the &quot;altar&quot; would thus be either at Leontopolis or the other one of the &quot;five cities&quot; which cannot be named with much pro...</p>

          <h3>IRON (1)</h3>
          <p>i&#x27;-urn (barzel; sideros): It is generally believed that the art of separating iron from its ores and making it into useful forms was not known much earlier than 1000 BC, and that the making of brass (bronze) antedates it by many centuries, in spite of the frequent Biblical references where brass and iron occur together. This conjecture is based upon the fact that no specimen of worked iron has been found whose antiquity can be vouched for. The want of such instruments, however, can be attributed to the ease with which iron corrodes. Evidence that iron was used is found, for example, in the hieroglyphics of the tomb of Rameses III, where the blades of some of the weapons are painted blue while others are painted red, a distinction believed to be due to the fact that some were made of iron or steel and some of brass. No satisfactory proof has yet been presented that the marvelous sculpturing on the hard Egyptian granite was done with tempered bronze. It seems more likely that steel tools were used. After the discovery of iron, it was evidently a long time in replacing bronze. This was probably due to the difficulties in smelting it. An old mountaineer once described to the writer the process of iron smelting as it was carried on in Mt. Lebanon in past centuries. As a boy he had watched his father, who was a smelter, operate one of the last furnaces to be fired. For each firing, many cords of wood, especially green oak branches, were used, and several days of strenuous pumping at the eight bellows was necessary to supply the air blast. As a result a small lump of wrought iron was removed from the bottom of the furnace after cooling. The iron thus won was carried to Damascus where it was made into steel by workers who kept their methods secret. This process, which has not been worked now for years, was undoubtedly the same as was used by the ancients. It is not at all unlikely that the Lebanon iron, transformed into steel, was what was referred to as &quot;northern iron&quot; in Jer 15:12 (the King James Version). In many districts the piles of slag from the ancient furnaces are still evident.Aside from the limited supply of iron ore in Mt. Lebanon (compare De 8:9), probably no iron was found in Syria and Palestine. It was brought from Tarshish (Eze 27:12) and Vedan and Jayan (Eze 27:19), and probably Egypt (De 4:20).The first mention of iron made in the Bible is in Ge 4:22, where Tubal-Cain is mentioned as &quot;the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron.&quot; It is likely that the Jews learned the art of metallurgy from the Phoenicians (2Ch 2:14) (see CRAFTS). Iron was used in Biblical times much as it is today. For a description of a smith at work see Ecclesiasticus 38:28. Huge city gates, overlaid with strips of iron (Ps 107:16; Isa 45:2), held in place by crude square-headed nails (1Ch 22:3), are still a familiar sight in the larger cities of Palestine and Syria (Ac 12:10). Threshing instruments were made of iron (Am 1:3); so also harrows (2Sa 12:31)...</p>

          <h3>IRRIGATION</h3>
          <p>ir-i-ga&#x27;-shun: No equivalent for this word is found in Biblical writings, although the use of irrigation for maintaining vegetable life is frequently implied (Ec 2:5,6; Isa 58:11). To one familiar with the methods of irrigation practiced in Palestine, Syria and Egypt, the passage, &quot;where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs&quot; (De 11:10), is easily explained. The water is brought in channels to the gardens, where it is distributed in turn to the different square plots bounded by banks of earth, or along the rows of growing vegetables planted on the sides of the trenches. In stony soil the breach in the canal leading to a particular plot is opened and closed with a hoe. Any obstruction in the trench is similarly removed, while in the soft, loamy soil of the coastal plain or in the Nile valley these operations can be done with the foot; a practice still commonly seen.The remains of the great irrigation works of the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians leave no doubt as to the extent to which they used water to redeem the deserts. In Palestine and Syria there was less need (De 10:7; 11:11) for irrigation. Here there is an annual fall of from 30 to 40 inches, coming principally during the winter. This is sufficient for the main crops. The summer supply of vegetables, as well as the fruit and mulberry trees, requires irrigation. Hardly a drop of many mountain streams is allowed to reach the sea, but is used to water the gardens of the mountain terraces and plains. This supply is now being supplemented by the introduction of thousands of pumps and oil engines for raising the water of the wells sufficiently to run it through the irrigation canals. Where a spring is small, its supply is gathered into a birket, or cistern, and then drawn off through a large outlet into the trenches, sometimes several days being required to fill the cistern. In Ec 2:6, Solomon is made to say, &quot;I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest.&quot; This passage helps to explain the uses of the so-called Pools of Solomon, South of Jerusalem. In this same district are traces of the ancient terraces which were probably watered from these pools.See AGRICULTURE; GARDEN.James A. Patch</p>

Root, Forms and Analogues:This name has the double spelling, yitschaq, and yitschaq (Isaak), corresponding to the two forms in which appears the root meaning &quot;to laugh&quot;--a root that runs through nearly all the Semitic languages. In Hebrew both tsachaq and sachaq have their cognate nouns, and signify, in the simple stem, &quot;to laugh,&quot; in the intensive stem, &quot;to jest, play, dance, fondle,&quot; and the like. The noun yitshar, meaning &quot;fresh oil,&quot; from a root tsahar (&quot;to be bright, conspicuous&quot;), proves that nouns can be built on precisely the model of yitschaq, which would in that case signify &quot;the laughing one,&quot; or something similar. Yet Barth (Die Nominalbildung in den semitischen Sprachen, 154, b and c) maintains that all proper names beginning with yodh prefixed to the root are really pure imperfects, i.e. verbal forms with some subject to be understood if not actually present. Hence, Isaac would mean &quot;laughs&quot;: either indefinite, &quot;one laughs,&quot; or &quot;he laughs,&quot; namely, the one understood as the subject. There are some 50 Hebrew names that have a similar form with no accompanying subject. Of these sometimes the meaning of the root is quite obscure, sometimes it is appropriate to any supposable subject. Each is a problem by itself; for the interpretation of any one of them there is little help to be gained from a comparison with the others.2. Implication:What subject, then, is to be understood with this imperfect verb yitschaq? Or is no definite subject to be supplied?(1) &#x27;El, God, may be supplied: &quot;God laughs.&quot; Such an expression might be understood of the Divine benevolence, or of the fearful laughter of scorn for His enemies (Ps 2:4), or, euphemistically, of the Divine wrath, the &quot;terrible glance,&quot; as of Moloch, etc. (so Meyer, Israeliten und ihre Nachbarstdmme, 255).(2) Some human person: &quot;he laughs.&quot; So, for example, he himself, namely, the child who receives the name; or, the father; or, the brother (not the mother, which would require titschaq). In the light now of these possibilities we turn to the narratives of Isaac&#x27;s birth and career and find the following subjects suggested:(a) father, Ge 17:17;(b) indefinite, &quot;one laughs&quot; (not &quot;she laughs,&quot; see above), Ge 18:12-15; 21:6; (c) brother, Ge 21:9; (d) himself, Ge 26:8. Of these passages the last two show the verb in the intensive stem in the signification of(c) &quot;mock&quot; (?), and(d) &quot;dally.&quot;We find this same verb in these senses in Ge 19:14 and 39:14,17, in the stories of Lot and of Joseph, a...</p>

The writings which bear his name are among the profoundest in all literature. One great theme--salvation by faith--stamps them all. Isaiah is the Paul of the Old Testament.1. Name:In Hebrew yesha`yahu, and yesha`yah; Greek Esaias; Latin Esaias and Isaias. His name was symbolic of his message. Like &quot;Joshua,&quot; it means &quot;Yahweh saves,&quot; or &quot;Yahweh is salvation,&quot; or &quot;salvation of Yahweh.&quot;2. Personal History:Isaiah was the son of Amoz (not Amos). He seems to have belonged to a family of some rank, as may be inferred from his easy access to the king (Isa 7:3), and his close intimacy with the priest (Isa 8:2). Tradition says he was the cousin of King Uzziah. He lived in Jerusalem and became court preacher. He was married and had two sons: Shear-jashub, his name signifying &quot;a remnant shall return&quot; (Isa 7:3), and Maher-shalal-hash-baz, &quot;hasting to the spoil, hurrying to the prey,&quot; symbolic of Assyria&#x27;s mad lust of conquest (Isa 8:3). Jewish tradition, based upon a false interpretation of Isa 7:14, declares he was twice married.3. Call:In the year that King Uzziah died, Isaiah, apparently while worshipping in the temple, received a call to the prophetic office (Isa 6). He responded with noteworthy alacrity, and accepted his commission, though he knew from the outset that his task was to be one of fruitless warning and exhortation (6:9-13). Having been reared in Jerusalem, he was well fitted to become the political and religious counselor of the nation, but the experience which prepared him most for his important work was the vision of the majestic and thrice-holy God which he saw in the temple in the death-year of King Uzziah. There is no good reason for doubting that this was his inaugural vision, though some regard it as a vision which came to him after years of experience in preaching and as intended to deepen his spirituality. While this is the only explicit &quot;vision&quot; Isaiah saw, yet his entire book, from first to last, is, as the title (11) suggests, a &quot;vision.&quot; His horizon, both political and spiritual, was practically unbounded. In a very true sense, as Delitzsch says, he was &quot;the universal prophet of Israel.&quot;4. Literary Genius and Style:For versatility of expression and brilliancy of imagery Isaiah had no superior, not even a rival. His style marks the climax of Hebrew literary article Both his periods and Genius and descriptions are most finished and sublime. ...</p>

Compare ESHBAAL and ISHVI (the King James Version &quot;Ishui&quot;). We probably have the right meaning of the name in Eshbaal and Ishvi, the words Baal and Yahweh being frequently interchanged. The change to Ish-bosheth, &quot;man of shame,&quot; in 2 Samuel, where the story of his shameful murder is related, may be better explained as reference to this (see MEPHIBOSHETH, whose name was also changed from Merib-baal for similar reasons), than to find here a suggestion of Baal-worship, but see HPN, 121, where the change is explained as a correction of the scribes, in consequence of prophetic protests.One of the sons of Saul (1Ch 8:33; 9:39; 1Sa 14:49) who, when his father and brothers were slain in the battle of Gilboa (1Sa 31:1), was proclaimed king over Israel by Abner, the captain of Saul&#x27;s host, at Mahanaim (2Sa 2:8). Ishbosheth was 40 years old at this time and reigned over Israel 2 years (2Sa 2:10). Judah, however, proclaimed David its king. The consequence was war (2Sa 2:12). The house of David prevailed against the house of Saul (2Sa 3:1), but the war did not come to a close until Abner, angry on account of the rebuke he suffered from Ish-Bosheth for his unlawful intimacy with Rizpah, Saul&#x27;s concubine, joined David (2Sa 3:6). David&#x27;s condition to return to him Michal, his wife before peace could be made, was fulfilled by Ish-Bosheth (2Sa 3:14 f), but it was not until after Abner&#x27;s death that Ish-Bosheth seems to have given up hopes of retaining his power (2Sa 4:1). The shameful murder of Ish-Bosheth by his own captains is recorded in 2Sa 4:5 ff. David punished the murderers who had expected reward and buried Ish-Bosheth in the grave of Abner at Hebron (2Sa 4:12 f).Arthur L. Breslich</p>

          <p>ish&#x27;-ma-el (yishma`e&#x27;l, &quot;God heareth,&quot; or &quot;God may,&quot; &quot;shall hear&quot;; Ismael):(1) The son of Abraham by Hagar, the Egyptian slave of his wife Sarah. The circumstances connected with his birth reveal what seems to us to be a very strange practice. It was customary among ancient peoples to correct the natural defect of barrenness by substituting a slave woman. In our narrative, this is shown to be authorized and brought about by the legitimate wife with the understanding that the offspring of such a union should be regarded as her own: &quot;It may be that I shall obtain children by her,&quot; literally, &quot;that I shall be builded by her&quot; (Ge 16:2).1. Birth:The hopes of Sarah were realized, for Hagar gave birth to a son, and yet the outcome was not fully pleasing to Abraham&#x27;s wife; there was one serious drawback. As soon as Hagar &quot;saw that she had conceived,&quot; her behavior toward her mistress underwent a radical change; she was &quot;despised in her eyes.&quot; But for the intervention of the angel of Yahweh, the boy might have been born in Egypt. For, being dealt with hardly (or humbled) by Sarah, the handmaid fled toward that country. On her way she was told by the angel to return to her mistress and submit herself &quot;under her hands.&quot; She obeyed, and the child who was to be as &quot;a wild ass among men&quot; was born when his father was 86 years old (Ge 16:7-16).2. Circumcision:At the age of 13 years the boy was circumcised (Ge 17:25) in accordance with the Divine command received by Abraham: &quot;Every male among you shall be circumcised&quot; (Ge 17:10). Thus young Ishmael was made a party to the covenant into which God had entered with the lad&#x27;s father. The fact that both Abraham and his son were circumcised the same day (Ge 17:26) undoubtedly adds to the importance of Ishmael&#x27;s partaking of the holy rite. He was certainly made to understand how much his father loved him and how deeply he was concerned about his spiritual welfare. We may even assume that there was a time when Abraham looked upon Ishmael as the promised seed. His error was made clear to him when God promised him the birth of a son by Sarah. At first this seemed to be incredible, Abraham being 100 years of age and Sarah 90. And yet, how could he disbelieve the word of God? His cherished, though mistaken, belief about Ishmael, his doubts regarding the possibility of Sarah&#x27;s motherhood, and the first faint glimmer of the real meaning of God&#x27;s promise, all these thoughts found their expression in the fervid wish: &quot;O that Ishmael might live before thee!&quot; (Ge 17:18). Gradually the truth dawned upon the patriarch that God s thoughts are not the thoughts of men, neither their ways His ways. But we have no reason to believe that this entire changing of the mental attitude of Abraham toward Ishmael reacted unfavorably on his future treatment of this son &quot;born of the flesh&quot; (compare Ge 21:11). If there were troubles in store for the boy likened by the angel of Yahweh to a wild ass, it was, in the main, the youngster&#x27;s own fault.3. B...</p>

The sons of Ishmael are given in Ge 25:13,14; they were twelve in number and gave rise to as many tribes, but the term Ishmaelite has a broader signification, as appears from Ge 37:28. 36, where it is identified with Midianite. From Ge 16:12 it may be inferred that it was applied to the Bedouin of the desert region East of the Jordan generally, for the character there assigned to Ishmael, &quot;His hand shall be against every man, and every man&#x27;s hand against him,&quot; fits the habits of Bedouin in all ages. Such was the character of the Midianites as described in Jud 7, who are again identified with the Ishmaelites (8:24). These references show that the Ishmaelites were not confined to the descendants of the son of Abraham and Hagar, but refer to the desert tribes in general, like &quot;the children of the east&quot; (Jud 7:12).H.

Sources:The chief and best source from which we can learn who this people was and what was its history is the Bible itself, especially the Old Testament, which tells us the story of this people from its earliest beginnings.(1) The Old Testament.The origins of Israel are narrated in Genesis; the establishment of theocracy, in the other books of the Pentateuch; the entrance into Canaan, in the Book of Joshua; the period preceding the kings, in the Book of Judges; the establishment of the monarchy and its development, in the Books of Samuel, and the opening chapters of the Books of Kings, which latter report also the division into two kingdoms and the history of these down to their overthrow. The Books of Chronicles contain, parallel with the books already mentioned, a survey of the historical development from Adam down to the Babylonian captivity, but confine this account to theocratical center of this history and its sphere. Connected with Chronicles are found the small Books of Ezra and Nehemiah, which probably originally constituted a part of Chronicles, but which pass over the Exile and begin at once with the story of the Return. Then, too, these two books contain only certain episodes in the history of the Return, which were of importance for the restoration of the Jewish theocracy, so that the story found in them is anything but complete. With the 5th century BC the Biblical narrative closes entirely. For the succeeding centuries we have nothing but some scattered data; but for the ...</p>

The First Period.1. The Two Kingdoms:The circumstances leading up to the foundation of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, or the Kingdom of the Ten Tribes, have been detailed under the heading KINGDOM OF JUDAH. From a secular point of view it would be more natural to regard the latter as an offshoot from the former, rather than the converse. But not only is the kingdom of Judah of paramount importance in respect of both religion and literature, but its government also was in the hands of a single dynasty, whereas that of the Northern Kingdom changed hands no less than 8 times, during the two and a half centuries of its existence. Moreover, the Southern Kingdom lasted about twice as long as the other.2. The Ist Dynasty:No sooner had Jeroboam I been elected the first ruler of the newly founded state than he set about managing its affairs with the energy for which he was distinguished (1Ki 11:28). To complete the disruption he established a sanctuary in opposition to that of Jerusalem (Ho 8:14), with its own order of priests (2Ch 11:14; 13:9), and founded two capital cities, Shechem on the West and Penuel on the East of the Jordan (1Ki 12:25). Peace seems to have been maintained between the rival governments during the 17 years&#x27; reign of Rehoboam, but on the accession of his son Abijah war broke out (1Ki 15:6,7; 2Ch 13:3 if). Shortly afterward Jeroboam died and was succeeded by his son Nadab, who was a year later assassinated, and the Ist Dynasty came to an end, after an existence of 23 years, being limited, in fact, to a single reign.3. The IInd Dynasty:The turn of the tribe of Issachar came next. They had not yet given a ruler to Israel; they could claim none of the judges, but they had taken their part at the assembling of the tribes under Deborah and Barak of Naphtali. Baasha began his reign of 24 years by extirpating the house of his predecessor (1Ki 15:29), just as the `Abbasids annihilated the Umeiyads. The capital was now Tirzah (1Ki 14:17; So 6:4), a site not yet identified. His Judean contemporary was ASA (which see), who, like his father Abijah, called in the aid of the Syrians against the Northern Kingdom. Baasha was unequal to the double contest and was forced to evacuate the ground he had gained. His son Elah was assassinated after a reign of a year, as he himself had assassinated the son of the founder of the preceding dynasty, and his entire family and adherents were massacred (1Ki 16:11).4. Civil War:The name of the assassin was Zimri, an officer of the charioteers, of unknown origin and tribe. But the kingship was always elective, and the army chose Omri, the commander-in-...</p>

CONCLUSION: CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THE RELIGION OF ISRAEL1. The Living God2. The Relation of Man to This GodLITERATUREI. Introduction: Historical Consideration of the Religion of IsraelIn former times it was the rule to draw out of the Old Testament its religious contents only for dogmatic purposes, without making any distinction between the different books. These writings were all regarded as the documents of the Divine revelation which had been given to this people alone and not to others. At the present time the first inquiry in the study of these books deals historically with the religious development of the Israelites. This religion was not of a strictly uniform nature, but is characterized by a development and a growth, and in the centuries which are covered by the Old Testament books it has passed through many changes. Then, too, in the different periods of this development there were various religious trends among the people and very different degrees in the extent of their religious knowledge. The common people were at times still entangled in crude heathen ideas, while the bearers of a higher Divine light ranked vastly above them. And even in those times, when these enlightened teachers secured full recognition, there occurred relapses into lower forms of religion on the part of the masses, especially because the influence of the nations surrounding Israel at all times made itself felt in the religious life and thoughts of the latter. And even when the correct teachings were accepted by the people, a malformation of the entire religion could readily occur through a petrifaction of the religious lif...</p>

          <h3>ISSACHAR</h3>
          <p>is&#x27;-a-kar (yissa(se)khar; Septuagint, Swete Issachar; Tischendorf, Issachar, so also in the New Testament, Tregelles, and Westcott and Hort, The New Testament in Greek):(1) The 9th son of Jacob, the 5th borne to him by Leah (Ge 30:17 f).1. The Name:His birth is in this passage connected with the strange story of Reuben and his mandrakes, and the name given him is apparently conceived as derived from &#x27;ish sakhar, &quot;a hired workman.&quot; There is a play upon the name in this sense in Ge 49:15, &quot;He bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant under taskwork.&quot; Wellhausen (Textder Buch. Sam., 95) thinks that the second element of the name may denote a deity; and Sokar, an Egyptian god, has been suggested. The name in that case would mean &quot;worshipper of Sokar.&quot; Practically nothing is preserved of the personal history of this patriarch beyond his share in the common actions of the sons of Jacob. Four sons were born to him before Jacob&#x27;s family removed to Egypt (Ge 46:13). In that land he died and was buried.2. The Tribe:At Sinai the tribe numbered 54,000 men of war over 20 years of age (Nu 1:29). At the end of the wanderings the numbers had grown to 64,300 (Nu 26:25). In the days of David, the Chronicler puts the figures at 87,000 (1Ch 7:5). See NUMBERS. The place of Issachar in the desert-march was with the standard of the tribe of Judah (along with Zebulun) on the East side of the tabernacle (Nu 2:5), this group forming the van of the host (Nu 10:14 f). The rabbis say that this standard was of 3 colors, sardine, topaz and carbuncle, on which were inscribed the names of the 3 tribes, bearing the figure of a lion&#x27;s whelp (Tg, pseudo. Jon. on Nu 2:3). The captain of the tribe was Nethanel ben-Zuar (Nu 1:8, etc.). Later this place was held by Igal ben-Joseph, the tribal representative among the spies (Nu 13:7). The prince chosen from Issachar to assist in the division of the land was Paltiel ben-Azzan (Nu 34:26). The position of Issachar at the strange ceremony near Shechem was on Mt. Gerizim, &quot;to bless the people&quot; (De 27:12).3. The Tribal Territory:Sixteen cities of Issachar are mentioned in Jos 19:17 ff, but the only indications of boundaries are Tabor in the North and Jordan in the East. We gather elsewhere that the territory of this tribe marched on the North with Zebulun and Naphtali (19:11,33); on the West with Manasseh and possibly Asher (17:10); and on the South with Manasseh (17:11). It does not seem to have had any point of contact with the sea. The portion of Issachar, therefore, included the plain of Esdraelon, Tabor, the hill of Moreh, and the slopes East to the Jordan. The fortresses along the South edge of the plain were held by Manasseh. Tola, a man of Issachar, held Shamir, a stronghold in Mt. Ephraim (Jud 10:1). To Manasseh was given Beth-shean with her &quot;towns&quot; (Jos 17:11). No reliable line can be drawn for the South border. The district thus indicated was small; but it embraced some of the most fruitful land in Palestine. By the very ric...</p>

          <h3>ITALY</h3>
          <p>it&#x27;-a-li (Italia): At first confined as a name to the extreme southern part of the Italian peninsula in the region now called Calabria, whence its application was gradually extended. In Greek usage of the 5th century BC, the name was applied to the coasts as far as Metapontum and Posidonia, being synonymous with Oenotria. The Oenotrians are represented as having assumed the name of Italians (Itali) from a legendary ruler Italus (Dionysius, i.12,35; Vergil, Aen. i.533). The extension of Roman authority seems to have given this name an ever-widening application, since it was used to designate their allies generally. As early as the time of Polybius the name Italy was sometimes employed as an appellation for all the country between the two seas (Tyrrhenian and Adriatic) and from the foot of the Alps to the Sicilian Straits (Polyb. i.6; ii.14; iii.39,54), although Cisalpine Gaul was not placed on a footing of complete equality with the peninsula as regards administration until shortly after the death of Julius Caesar. From the time of Augustus the term was used in practically its modern sense (Nissen, Italische Landeskunde, I, 57-87).The name Italy occurs 3 times in the New Testament: Ac 18:2, Aquila &quot;lately come from Italy,&quot; because of the expulsion of the Jews from Rome under Claudius; Ac 27:1, the decision that Paul be sent to Italy; Heb 13:24, salutation from those &quot;of Italy.&quot; The adjective form is found in the appellation, &quot;Italian band&quot; (cobors Italica, Ac 10:1).The history of ancient Italy, in so far as it falls within the scope of the present work, is treated under ROME (which see).George H.

While Nadab and Abihu were prematurely cut off for offering strange fire before the Lord (Le 10:1,2; Nu 3:4; 26:61), and Eleazar was appointed chief of the tribe of Levi (Ex 6:23,25) and ultimately succeeded Aaron (Ex 28:1), Ithamar was made the treasurer of the offerings for the Tabernacle (Ex 38:21), and superintendent of the Gershonites and Merarites in the service of the Tabernacle (Nu 4:28,33). In the time of Eli the high-priesthood had come to be in his family, but how, and whether before Eli&#x27;s day or first in Eli&#x27;s person, is not told and need not be conjectured. W. R. Smith in Encyclopedia Biblica (art. &quot;Eli&quot;), on the strength of 1Sa 2:27,28, holds that the priesthood was originally in Eli&#x27;s line; but the words &quot;the house of thy father&quot; do not necessarily mean only the house of Ithamar, but may, and most probably do, refer to Aaron and his descendants, of whom Ithamar was one. Nor does the cutting off of Eli&#x27;s family from the priesthood and the setting in their place of &quot;a faithful priest,&quot; who should do everything according to Yahweh&#x27;s will and walk before Yahweh&#x27;s anointed forever, find its complete fulfillment in the deposition of Abiathar or Ahimelech, his son, and the installation of Zadok in the time of Solomon (1Ki 2:35; 1Ch 29:22; see ZADOK).

The narrative reveals David&#x27;s chivalrous and unselfish spirit in time of trouble, as well as the most self-sacrificing loyalty on the part of Ittai. He seems to have but recently left his native city and joined David&#x27;s army through personal attachment to the king. David rapidly promoted him. Hearing of Absalom&#x27;s rebellion and approach to Jerusalem, he flees with David. The latter remonstrates, urges him to go back and join Absalom, as he is a foreigner and in exile. His interests are in the capital and with the king; there is no reason why he should be a fugitive and perhaps suffer the loss of everything; it would be better for him, with his band of men, to put himself and them at the service of Absalom, the new king. &quot;Mercy and truth be with thee,&quot; says David in his magnanimity. Ittai, with a double oath, absolutely refuses to go back, but will stand by David until the last. Remonstrance being useless, the monarch orders him across the river, doubtless glad that he had such a doughty warrior and faithful friend by his side. On mustering his hosts to meet Absalom, David makes Ittai a chief captain with the intrepid Joab and Abishai. He doubtless did his part in the battle, and as nothing more is said of him it is possible that he fell in the fight.(2) A Benjamite, one of David&#x27;s 30 mighty men (2Sa 23:29; 1Ch 11:31, &quot;Ithai&quot;).J.

          <h3>ITURAEA</h3>
          <p>it-u-re&#x27;-a (Itouraia):1. The Word an Adjective:The term occurs only once in Scripture, in the definition of Philip&#x27;s territory: tes Itouraias kai Trachonitidos choras, which the King James Version renders: &quot;of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis,&quot; and Revised Version: &quot;the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis&quot; (Lu 3:1). Sir W.M. Ramsay has given reasons for the belief that this word was certainly never used as a noun by any writer before the time of Eusebius (Expos, 1894, IX, 51 ff, 143 ff, 288 ff). It must be taken as an adjective indicating the country occupied by the Itureans.2. The Itureans:The descent of the Itureans must probably be traced to Jetur, son of Ishmael (Ge 25:15), whose progeny were clearly numbered among the Arabian nomads. According to Eupolemus (circa 150 BC), quoted by Eusebius (Praep. Evang. IX, 30), they were associated with the Nabateans, Moabites and Ammonites against whom David warred on the East of the Jordan. They are often mentioned by Latin writers; their skill in archery seems greatly to have impressed the Romans. They were skillful archers (Caesar, Bell. Afr. 20); a lawless (Strabo, xvi.2,10) and predatory people (Cicero, Philipp. ii.112). In the Latin inscriptions Iturean soldiers have Syrian names (HJP, I, ii, 326). They would therefore be the most northerly of the confederates opposed to David (supra), and their country may naturally be sought in the neighborhood of Mt. Hermon.3. Indications of Their Territory:There is nothing to show when they moved from the desert to this district. Aristobulus made war against the Itureans, compelled many of them to be circumcised, and added a great part of their territory to Judea, 140 BC (Ant., XIII, xi, 3). Dio Cassius calls Lysanias &quot;king of the Itureans&quot; (xlix.32), and from him Zenodorus leased land which included Ulatha and Paneas, 25 BC. The capital of Lysanias was Chalcis, and he ruled over the land from Damascus to the sea. Josephus speaks of Soemus as a tetrarch in Lebanon (Vita, 11); while Tacitus calls him governor of the Itureans (Ann. xii.23). The country of Zenodorus, lying between Trachonitis and Galilee, and including Paneas and Ulatha, Augustus bestowed on Herod, 20 BC (Ant., XV, x, 3). In defining the tetrarchy of Philip, Josephus names Batanea, Trachonitis and Auranitis, but says nothing of the Itureans (Ant., XVII, xi, 4; BJ, II, vi, 3). Paneas and Ulatha were doubtless included, and this may have been Iturean territory (HJP, I, ii, 333). It seems probable, therefore, that the Itureans dwelt mainly in the mountains, and in the broad valley of Coele-Syria; but they may also have occupied the district to the Southeast of Hermon, the modern Jedur. It is not possible to define more closely the Iturean country; indeed it is not clear whether Luke intended to indicate two separate parts of the dominion of Philip, or used names which to some extent overlapped.It has been suggested that the name Jedur may be derived from the Hebrew yeTur, and so be equivalent t...</p>

In the passages cited it is translated in English Versions of the Bible &quot;ivory&quot; (of &quot;crag,&quot; 1Sa 14:4,5; &quot;cliff,&quot; Job 39:28 twice; &quot;flesh-hook of three teeth,&quot; 1Sa 2:13). Shenhabbim is thought to be a contracted form of shen ha-&#x27;ibbim, i.e. ha, the article, and &#x27;ibbim, plural of &#x27;ibbah or &#x27;ibba&#x27;; compare Egyptian ab, ebu, &quot;elephant,&quot; and compare Latin ebur, &quot;ivory&quot; (see Liddell and Scott, under the word elephas). On the other hand, it may be a question whether -bim is not a singular form connected with the Arabic fil, &quot;elephant.&quot; If the word for &quot;elephant&quot; is not contained in shenhabbim, it occurs nowhere in the Hebrew Bible.Ivory was probably obtained, as now, mainly from the African elephant. It was rare and expensive. It is mentioned in connection with the magnificence of Solomon (1Ki 10:18,22), being brought by the ships of Tarshish (2Ch 9:17,21). An &quot;ivory house&quot; of Ahab is mentioned in 1Ki 22:39. It is mentioned among the luxuries of Israel in the denunciations of Amos (3:15; 6:4). It occurs in the figurative language of Ps 45:8; So 5:14; 7:4. It is used for ornamentation of the ships of the Tyrians (Eze 27:6), who obtain it with ebony through the men of Dedan (27:15). It is among the merchandise of Babylon (Re 18:12).We do not learn of the use of elephants in war until a few centuries before the Christian era. In 1 Macc 8:6, there is a reference to the defeat of Antiochus the Great, &quot;having an hundred and twenty elephants,&quot; by Scipio Africanus in 190 BC. 1 Macc 1:17 speaks of the invasion of Egypt by Antiochus Epiphanes with an army in which there were elephants. 1 Macc 6:28-47 has a detailed account of a battle between Antiochus Eupator and Judas Maccabeus at Bethsura (Beth-zur). There were 32 elephants. Upon the &quot;beasts&quot; theria) there were &quot;strong towers of wood&quot;; &quot;There were also upon every one two and thirty strong men, that fought upon them, beside the Indian that ruled him.&quot;In Job 40:15, the King James Version margin has for &quot;behemoth,&quot; &quot;the elephant, as some think.&quot;Alfred Ely Day</p>

It has been assimilated with the Avva of 2Ki 17:24 as one of the places whence Sargon brought captives to Samaria, and identified with Hit on the Euphrates, between Anah and Ramadieh, but this seems improbable, as is also the suggestion that it is Emma, the modern `Imm, between Antioch and Aleppo. Hommel (Expository Times, April, 1898, 330) upholds the view that Hena and Ivvah, or, as he prefers to read, Avvah, are not places at all, but the names of the two chief gods of Hamath, Arpad and Sepharvaim. This would be consistent with 2Ki 18:34; but 19:13: &quot;Where is the king .... of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?&quot; and 17:31, where the gods of Sepharvaim are stated to be Adrammelech and Anammelech, raise serious difficulties. In all probability, the identification of Ivvah depends upon the correct localization of the twofold Sepharvaim, of which Hena and Ivvah may have been the names. The identification of Sepharvaim with the Babylonian Sip(p)ar is now practically abandoned.See SEPHARVAIM.T. G. Pinches</p>
