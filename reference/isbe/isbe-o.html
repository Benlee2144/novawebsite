          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">ok: Several Hebrew words are so translated, but there has always been great doubt as to which words should be translated &quot;oak&quot; and which &quot;terebinth.&quot; This uncertainty appears in the Septuagint and all through English Versions of the Bible; in recent revisions &quot;terebinth&quot; has been increasingly added in the margin. All the Hebrew words are closely allied and may originally have had simply the meaning of &quot;tree&quot; but it is clear that, when the Old Testament was written, they indicated some special kind of tree.1. Hebrew Words and References:The words and references are as follows:(1) &#x27;elah (in the Septuagint usually terebinthos. in Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) terebinthus, or, more commonly, quercus) (Ge 35:4; Jud 6:11,19; 2Sa 18:9,10,14; 1Ki 13:14; 1Ch 10:12; Isa 1:30; Eze 6:13--in all these margin &quot;terebinth &quot;). In Isa 6:13 (the King James Version &quot;teil tree&quot;) and Ho 4:13 (the King James Version &quot;elms&quot;) the translation is &quot;terebinths&quot; because of the juxtaposition of &#x27;allon, translated &quot;oaks.&quot; &quot;Vale of Elah&quot; (margin &quot;the Terebinth&quot;) is found in 1Sa 17:2,19; 21:9. The expression in Isa 1:30, &quot;whose leaf fadeth,&quot; is more appropriate to the terebinth than the oak (see below).(2) &#x27;allah (terebinthos, quercus (Vulgate)), apparently a slight variant for &#x27;elah; only in Jos 24:26; Ge 35:4 (&#x27;elah) and in Jud 9:6 (&#x27;elon).(3) &#x27;elim or &#x27;eylim, perhaps plural of &#x27;elah occurs in Isa 1:29 (margin &quot;terebinths&quot;); Isa 57:5, margin &quot;with idols,&quot; the King James Version &quot;idols,&quot; margin &quot;oaks&quot;; Isa 61:3, &quot;trees&quot;; Eze 31:14 (text very doubtful), &quot;height,&quot; the King James Version margin &quot;upon themselves&quot;; &#x27;el, in El-paran Septuagint terebinthos) (Ge 14:6), probably means the &quot;tree&quot; or &quot;terebinth&quot; of Paran. Celsius (Hierob. 1,34 ff) argues at length that the above words apply well to the TEREBINTH (which see) in all the passages in which they occur.(4) &#x27;elon (usually drus, &quot;oak&quot;), in Ge 12:6; 13:18; 14:13; 18:1; De 11:30; Jos 19:33; Jud 4:11; 9:6,37; 1Sa 10:3 (the King James Version &quot;plain&quot;); in all these references the margin has &quot;terebinth&quot; or &quot;terebinths.&quot; In Ge 12:6; De 11:30 we have &quot;oak&quot; or &quot;oaks&quot; &quot;of the teacher&quot; (Moreh); &quot;oak in Zaanannim&quot; in Jud 4:11; Jos 19:33; the &quot;oak of Meonenim,&quot; margin &quot;the augurs&#x27; oak (or, terebinth)&quot; in Jud 9:37.(5) &#x27;allon (commonly drus, or balanos), in Ge 35:8 (compare 35:4); Ho 4:13; Isa 6:13, is contrasted with &#x27;elah, showing that &#x27;allon and &#x27;elah cannot be identical, so no marginal references occur; also in Isa 44:14; Am 2:9, but in all other passages, the margin &quot;terebinth&quot; or &quot;terebinths&quot; occurs. &quot;Oaks of Bashan&quot; occurs in Isa 2:13; Eze 27:6; Zec 11:2.If (1) (2) (3) refer especially to the terebinth, then (4) and (5) are probably correctly translated &quot;oak.&quot; If we may judge at all by present conditions, &quot;oaks&quot; of Bashan is far more correct than &quot;terebinths&quot; of Bashan.2. Varieties of Oak:There are, according to Post (Flora of Palestine, 737-41), no less than 9 species of oak (Natural Order Cupuliferae) in Syria, and he ad...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">oth (shebhu`ah, probably from shebha`, &quot;seven,&quot; the sacred number, which occurs frequently in the ritual of an oath; horkos; and the stronger word &#x27;alah, by which a curse is actually invoked upon the oath-breaker Septuagint ara)): In Mt 26:70-74 Peter first denies his Lord simply, then with an oath (shebhu`ah), then invokes a curse (&#x27;alah), thus passing through every stage of asseveration.1. Law Regarding Oaths:The oath is the invoking of a curse upon one&#x27;s self if one has not spoken the truth (Mt 26:74), or if one fails to keep a promise (1Sa 19:6; 20:17; 2Sa 15:21; 19:23). It played a very important part, not only in lawsuits (Ex 22:11; Le 6:3,5) and state affairs (Ant., XV, x, 4), but also in the dealings of everyday life (Ge 24:37; 50:5; Jud 21:5; 1Ki 18:10; Ezr 10:5). The Mosaic laws concerning oaths were not meant to limit the widespread custom of making oaths, so much as to impress upon the people the sacredness of an oath, forbidding on the one hand swearing falsely (Ex 20:7; Le 19:12; Zec 8:17, etc.), and on the other swearing by false gods, which latter was considered to be a very dark sin (Jer 12:16; Am 8:14). In the Law only two kinds of false swearing are mentioned: false swearing of a witness, and false asseveration upon oath regarding a thing found or received (Le 5:1; 6:2 ff; compare Pr 29:24). Both required a sin offering (Le 5:1). The Talmud gives additional rules, and lays down certain punishments for false swearing; in the case of a thing found it states what the false swearer must pay (Makkoth 2 3; Shebhu`oth 8 3). The Jewish interpretation of the 3rd commandment is that it is not concerned with oaths, but rather forbids the use of the name of Yahweh in ordinary cases (so Dalman).2. Forms of Swearing:Swearing in the name of the Lord (Ge 14:22; De 6:13; Jud 21:7; Ru 1:17, etc.) was a sign of loyalty to Him (De 10:20; Isa 48:11; Jer 12:16). We know from Scripture (see above) that swearing by false gods was frequent, and we learn also from the newly discovered Elephantine papyrus that the people not only swore by Jahu (= Yahweh) or by the Lord of Heaven, but also among a certain class of other gods, e.g. by Herem-Bethel, and by Isum. In ordinary intercourse it was customary to swear by the life of the person addressed (1Sa 1:26; 20:3; 2Ki 2:2); by the life of the king (1Sa 17:55; 25:26; 2Sa 11:11); by one&#x27;s own head (Mt 5:36); by the earth (Mt 5:35); by the heaven (Mt 5:34; 23:22); by the angels (BJ, II, xvi, 4); by the temple (Mt 23:16), and by different parts of it (Mt 23:16); by Jerusalem (Mt 5:35; compare Kethubhoth 2:9). The oath &quot;by heaven&quot; (Mt 5:34; 23:22) is counted by Jesus as the oath in which God&#x27;s name is invoked. Jesus does not mean that God and heaven are identical, but He desires to rebuke those who paltered with an oath by avoiding a direct mention of a name of God. He teaches that such an oath is a real oath and must be considered as sacredly binding.3. The Formula:Not much is told us as to the ceremonies observ...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">Obadiah is the shortest book in the Old Testament. The theme of the book is the destruction of Edom. Consequent upon the overthrow of Edom is the enlargement of the borders of Judah and the establishment of the kingship of Yahweh. Thus far all scholars are agreed; but on questions of authorship and date there is wide divergence of opinion.1. Contents of the Book:(1) Yahweh summons the nations to the overthrow of proud Edom. The men of Esau will be brought down from their lofty strongholds; their hidden treasures will be rifled; their confederates will turn against them; nor will the wise and the mighty men in Edom be able to avert the crushing calamity (Ob 1:1-9).(2) The overthrow of Edom is due to the violence and cruelty shown toward his brother Jacob. The prophet describes the cruelty and shameless gloating over a brother&#x27;s calamity, in the form of earnest appeals to Edom not to do the selfish and heartless deeds of which he had been guilty when Jerusalem was sacked by foreign foes (Ob 1:10-14).(3) The day of the display of Yahweh&#x27;s retributive righteousness upon the nations is near. Edom shall be completely destroyed by the people whom he has tried to uproot, while Israel&#x27;s captives shall return to take possession of their own land and also to seize and rule the mount of Esau. Thus the kingship of Yahweh shall be established (Ob 1:15-21).2. Unity of the Book:The unity of Obadiah was first challenged by Eichhorn in 1824, 1:17-21 being regarded by him as an appendix attached to the original exilic prophecy in the time of Alexander Janneus (104-78 BC). Ewald thought that an exilic prophet, to whom he ascribed 1:11-14 and 19-21, had made use of an older prophecy by Obadiah in 1:1-10, and in 1:15-18 of material from another older prophet who was contemporary, like Obadiah, with Isaiah. As the years went on, the material assigned to the older oracle was limited by some to 1:1-9 and by others to 1:1-6. Wellhausen assigned to Obadiah 1:1-5,7,10,11,13,14,15b, while all else was regarded as a later appendix. Barton&#x27;s theory of the composition of Obadiah is thus summed up by Bewer: &quot;Ob 1:1-6 are a pre-exilic oracle of Obadiah, which was quoted by Jeremiah, and readapted with additions (Ob 1:7-15) by another Obadiah in the early post-exilic days; 1:16-21 form an appendix, probably from Maccabean times&quot; (ICC, 5). Bewer&#x27;s own view is closely akin to Barton&#x27;s. He thinks that Obadiah, writing in the 5th century BC, &quot;quoted 1:1-4 almost, though not quite, literally; that he commented on the older oracle in 1:5-7, partly in the words of the older prophet, partly in his own words, in order to show that it had been fulfilled in his own day; and that in 1:8,9 he quoted once more from the older oracle without any show of literalness.&quot; He ascribes to Obadiah 1:10-14 and 15b. The appendix consists of two sections, 1:15a,16-18 and 1:19-21, possibly by different authors, 1:18 being a quotation from some older prophecy.

Smith, Samuel, 294 f, though others explain it as = &quot;servant of man&quot;): In 2Sa 6:10,11,12; 1Ch 13:13,14 a Philistine of Gath and servant of David, who received the Ark of Yahweh into his house when David brought it into Jerusalem from Kiriath-jearim. Because of the sudden death of Uzzah, David was unwilling to proceed with the Ark to his citadel, and it remained three months in the house of Obed-edom, &quot;and Yahweh blessed Obed-edom, and all his house&quot; (2Sa 6:11). According to 1Ch 13:14 the Ark had a special &quot;house&quot; of its own while there. He is probably the same as the Levite of 1Ch 15:25. In 1Ch 15:16-21 Obed-edom is a &quot;singer,&quot; and in 1Ch 15:24 a &quot;doorkeeper,&quot; while according to 1Ch 26:4-8,15 he is a Korahite doorkeeper, to whose house fell the overseership of the storehouse (26:15), while 1Ch 16:5,38 names him as a &quot;minister before the ark,&quot; a member of the house or perhaps guild of Jeduthun (see 2Ch 25:24).Obed-edom is an illustration of the service rendered to Hebrew religion by foreigners, reminding one of the Simon of Cyrene who bore the cross of Jesus (Mt 27:32, etc.). The Chronicler naturally desired to think that only Levites could discharge such duties as Obed-edom performed, and hence, the references to him as a Levite.David Francis Roberts.</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">The &quot;obedience&quot; (hupakoe) of Christ is directly mentioned but 3 times in the New Testament, although many other passages describe or allude to it: &quot;Through the obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous&quot; (Ro 5:19); &quot;He humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross&quot; (Php 2:8); &quot;Though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered&quot; (Heb 5:8). In 2Co 10:5, the phrase signifies an attitude toward Christ: &quot;every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.&quot;1. As an Element of Conduct and Character:His subjection to His parents (Lu 2:51) was a necessary manifestation of His loving and sinless character, and of His disposition and power to do the right in any situation. His obedience to the moral law in every particular is asserted by the New Testament writers: &quot;without sin&quot; (Heb 4:15); &quot;who knew no sin&quot; (2Co 5:21); &quot;holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners&quot; (Heb 7:26), etc.; and is affirmed by Himself: &quot;Which of you convicteth me of sin?&quot; (Joh 8:46); and implicitly conceded by His enemies, since no shadow of accusation against His character appears. Of His ready, loving, joyful, exact and eager obedience to the Father, mention will be made later, but it was His central and most outstanding characteristic, the filial at its highest reach, limitless, &quot;unto death.&quot; His usually submissive and law-abiding attitude toward the authorities and the great movements and religious requirements of His day was a part of His loyalty to God, and of the strategy of His campaign, the action of the one who would set an example and wield an influence, as at His baptism: &quot;Thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness&quot; (Mt 3:15); the synagogue worship (Lu 4:16, &quot;as his custom was&quot;); the incident of the tribute money: &quot;Therefore the sons are free. But, lest we cause them to stumble,&quot; etc. (Mt 17:24-27). Early, however, the necessities of His mission as Son of God and institutor of the new dispensation obliged Him frequently to display a judicial antagonism to current prescription and an authoritative superiority to the rulers; and even to important details of the Law, that would in most eyes mark Him as insurgent, and did culminate in the cross, but was the sublimest obedience to the Father, whose authority alone He, as full-grown man, and Son of man, could recognize.2. Its Christological Bearing:Two Scriptural statements raise an important question as to the inner experience of Jesus. Heb 5:8 states that &quot;though he was a Son, yet learned (he) obedience by the things which he suffered&quot; (emathen aph&#x27; hon epathen ten hupakoen); Php 2:6,8 Existing in the form of God .... he humbled himself, becoming obedient, even unto death.&quot; As Son of God, His will was never out of accord with the Father&#x27;s will. How then was it necessary to, or could He, learn obedience, or become obedient? The same question in another form arises from another part of the passage in Heb 5:9: &quot;And having been made perfect, he...</p>

Meaning of Terms:In its simpler Old Testament meaning the word signifies &quot;to hear,&quot; &quot;to listen.&quot; It carries with it, however, the ethical significance of hearing with reverence and obedient assent. In the New Testament a different origin is suggestive of &quot;hearing under&quot; or of subordinating one&#x27;s self to the person or thing heard, hence, &quot;to obey.&quot; There is another New Testament usage, however, indicating persuasion from, peithomai.The relation expressed is twofold: first, human, as between master and servant, and particularly between parents and children. &quot;If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that, will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them; then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place&quot; (De 21:18,19; compare Pr 15:20); or between sovereign and subjects, &quot;The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me&quot; (2Sa 22:45; 1Ch 29:23).2. The Old Testament Conception:The highest significance of its usage, however, is that of the relation of man to God. Obedience is the supreme test of faith in God and reverence for Him. The Old Testament conception of obedience was vital. It was the one important relationship which must not be broken. While sometimes this relation may have been formal and cold, it nevertheless was the one strong tie which held the people close to God. The significant spiritual relation is expressed by Samuel when he asks the question, &quot;Hath Yahweh as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams&quot; (1Sa 15:22). It was the condition without which no right relation might be sustained to Yahweh. This is most clearly stated in the relation between Abraham and Yahweh when he is assured &quot;In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice&quot; (Ge 22:18).In prophetic utterances, future blessing and prosperity were conditioned upon obedience: &quot;If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land&quot; (Isa 1:19). After surveying the glories of the Messianic kingdom, the prophet assures the people that &quot;this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of Yahweh your God&quot; (Zec 6:15). On the other hand misfortune, calamity, distress and famine are due to their disobedience and distrust of Yahweh.See DISOBEDIENCE.This obedience or disobedience was usually related to the specific commands of Yahweh as contained in the law, yet they conceived of God as giving commands by other means. Note especially the rebuke of Samuel to Saul: &quot;Because thou obeyedst not the voice of Yahweh, .... therefore hath Yahweh done this thing unto thee this day&quot; (1Sa 28:18).3. The New Testament Conception:In the New Testament a higher spiritual and mor...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">o-ba&#x27;-sans: It is used 9 times in the King James Version in the phrase &quot;made (or did) obeisance&quot; as a rendering of the reflexive form of (shachah), and denotes the bow or curtsey indicative of deference and respect. The same form of the verb is sometimes translated &quot;to bow one&#x27;s self&quot; when it expresses the deferential attitude of one person to another (Ge 33:6,7, etc.). Occasionally the vow of homage or fealty to a king on the part of a subject is suggested. In Joseph&#x27;s dream his brother&#x27;s sheaves made obeisance to his sheaf (Ge 43:28; compare also 2Sa 15:5; 2Ch 24:17). But in a large number of instances the verb denotes the prostrate posture of the worshipper in the presence of Deity, and is generally rendered, &quot;to worship&quot; in the King James Version. In all probability this was the original significance of the word (Ge 24:26, etc.). Obeisance (= obedience) originally signified the vow of obedience made by a vassal to his lord or a slave to his master, but in time denoted the act of bowing as a token of respect.T. Lewis</p>

Most of them, indeed are quite good modern usage (as &quot;observe a feast,&quot; Ex 12:17, etc.; &quot;observe a law&quot; Le 19:37, etc.), but a few are archaic. So Ge 37:11, the King James Version &quot;His father observed the saying&quot; (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;kept the saying in mind&quot;); Ho 13:7, &quot;As a leopard .... will I observe them&quot; (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;watch&quot;); Jon 2:8, &quot;observe lying vanities&quot; (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;regard,&quot; but &quot;give heed to&quot; would be clearer; compare Ps 107:43). Still farther from modern usage is Ho 14:8, &quot;I have heard him, and observed him&quot; (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;will regard&quot;; the meaning is &quot;care for&quot;); and Mr 6:20, &quot;For Herod feared John .... and observed him&quot; (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;kept him safe&quot;). In the last case, the King James Version editors seem to have used &quot;to observe&quot; as meaning &quot;to give reverence to.&quot;Observation is found in Lu 17:20, &quot;The kingdom of God cometh not with observation&quot; (meta paratereseos). The meaning of the English is, &quot;so that it can be observed,&quot; but the exact force of the underlying Greek (&quot;visibly&quot;? &quot;so that it can be computed in advance&quot;?) is a matter of extraordinary dispute at the present time.See KINGDOM OF GOD.Burton Scott Easton</p>

The two verses should agree, so we should probably read in 15:8, &quot;the prophecy of Azariah, the son of Oded, the prophet,&quot; or else &quot;the prophecy of Azariah the prophet.&quot;See AZARIAH.(2) A prophet of Samaria (2Ch 28:9) who lived in the reigns of Pekah, king of the Northern Kingdom, and Ahaz, king of Judah. According to 2Ch 28, Oded protested against the enslavement of the captives which Pekah had brought from Judah and Jerusalem on his return from the Syro-Ephraimitic attack on the Southern Kingdom (735 BC). In this protest he was joined by some of the chiefs of Ephraim, and the captives were well treated. After those who were naked (i.e. those who had scanty clothing; compare the meaning of the word &quot;naked&quot; in Mr 14:51) had been supplied with clothing from the spoil, and the bruised anointed with oil, the prisoners were escorted to Jericho.The narrative of 2Ch 28 as a whole does not agree with that of 2Ki 15:37; 16:5 f, where the allied armies of Rezin of Damascus and Pekah besieged Jerusalem, but failed to capture it (compare Isa 7:1-17; 8:5-8 a). As Curtis points out (Chronicles, 459, where he compares Ex 21:2 ff; Le 25:29-43; De 15:12-18), wholesale enslavement of their fellow-countrymen was not allowed to the Hebrews, and this fact the passage illustrates. It seems to be a fulfillment in spirit of Isa 61:1-2, a portion which our Lord read in the synagogue at Nazareth (Lu 4:16-20).David Francis Roberts</p>

In the Norman period, however, &quot;of&quot; was taken to represent the French de (a use well developed by the time of Chaucer), and in the Elizabethan period both senses of &quot;of&quot; were in common use. But after about 1600 the later force of the word became predominant, and in the earlier sense (which is now practically obsolete) it was replaced by other prepositions. In consequence the King James Version (and in some cases the Revised Version (British and American)) contains many uses of &quot;of&quot; that are no longer familiar--most of them, to be sure, causing no difficulty, but there still being a few responsible for real obscurities.(2) Of the uses where &quot;of&quot; signifies &quot;from,&quot; the most common obscure passages are those where &quot;of&quot; follows a verb of hearing. In modern English &quot;hear of&quot; signifies &quot;to gain information about,&quot; as it does frequently in the King James Version (Mr 7:25; Ro 10:14, etc.). But more commonly this use of &quot;of&quot; in the King James Version denotes the source from which the information is derived. So Joh 15:15, &quot;all things that I have heard of my Father&quot;; Ac 10:22, &quot;to hear words of thee&quot;; 28:22, &quot;We desire to hear of thee&quot;; compare 1Th 2:13; 2Ti 1:13; 2:2, etc. (similarly Mt 11:29, &quot;and learn of me&quot;; compare Joh 6:45). All of these are ambiguous and in modern English give a wrong meaning, so that in most cases (but not Mt 11:29 or Ac 28:22) the Revised Version (British and American) substitutes &quot;from.&quot; A different example of the same use of &quot;of&quot; is 2Co 5:1, &quot;a building of God&quot; (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;from&quot;). So Mr 9:21, &quot;of a child,&quot; means &quot;from childhood&quot; (&quot;from a child,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American), is dubious English). A still more obscure passage is Mt 23:25, &quot;full of extortion and excess.&quot; &quot;Full of&quot; elsewhere in the King James Version (and even in the immediate context, Mt 23:27,28) refers to the contents, but here the &quot;of&quot; represents the Greek ek, &quot;out of,&quot; and denotes the source--&quot;The contents of your cup and platter have been purchased from the gains of extortion and excess.&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) again substitutes &quot;from,&quot; with rather awkward results, but the Greek itself is unduly compressed. In Mr 11:8, one of the changes made after the King James Version was printed has relieved an obscurity, for where the edition of 1611 read &quot;cut down branches of the trees,&quot; the modern editions have &quot;off&quot; (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;from&quot;). For clear examples of this use of &quot;of,&quot; without the obscurities, compare Judith 2:21, &quot;they went forth of Nineveh&quot;; 2 Macc 4:34, &quot;forth of the sanctuary&quot;; and, especially, Mt 21:25, &quot;The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men?&quot; Here &quot;from&quot; and &quot;of&quot; represent exactly the same Greek preposition, and the change in English is arb...</p>

The weeping prophet uses it as he looks upon his erstwhile fair and holy city, despoiled, defiled, derided by the profane, the enemies of God and of His people (La 3:45, cechi). The favored people, whose city lies in heaps and is patrolled by the heathen, are hailed and held up as the scrapings, the offscouring, the offal of the earth. They are humbled to earth, crushed into the dust, carried away to be the slaves of licentious idolaters. The haughty, cruel, cutting boastfulness of the victors covered Israel with contumely.In 1Co 4:13 the greatest of the apostles reminds the prosperous and self-satisfied Corinthinns that they, the apostles, were &quot;made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things.&quot; In such contempt were they held by the unbelieving world and by false apostles.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">(`ogh; Og): King of Bashan, whose territory, embracing 60 cities, was conquered by Moses and the Israelites immediately after the conquest of Sihon, king of the Amorites (Nu 21:33-35; De 3:1-12). The defeat took place at Edrei, one of the chief of these cities (Nu 21:33; Jos 12:4), and Og and his people were &quot;utterly destroyed&quot; (De 3:6). Og is described as the last of the REPHAIM (which see), or giant-race of that district, and his giant stature is borne out by what is told in De 3:11 of the dimensions of his &quot;bedstead of iron&quot; (`eres barzel), 9 cubits long and 4 broad (13 1/2 ft. by 6 ft.), said to be still preserved at Rabbath of Ammon when the verse describing it was written. It is not, of course, necessary to conclude that Og&#x27;s own height, though immense, was as great as this. Some, however, prefer to suppose that what is intended is &quot;a sarcophagus of black basalt,&quot; which iron-like substance abounds in the Hauran. The conquered territory was subsequently bestowed on the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh (Nu 32:33; De 3:12,13). Other references to Og are De 1:4; 4:47; 31:4; Jos 2:10; 9:10; 13:12,30). The memory of this great conquest lingered all through the national history (Ps 135:11; 136:20).

Figurative UsesShemen, literally, &quot;fat,&quot; corresponds to the common Arabic senin of similar meaning, although now applied to boiled butter fat.1. Terms:Another Hebrew word, zayith (zeth), &quot;olive,&quot; occurs with shemen in several passages (Ex 27:20; 30:24; Le 24:2). The corresponding Arabic zeit, a contraction of zeitun, which is the name for the olive tree as well as the fruit, is now applied to oils in general, to distinguish them from solid fats. Zeit usually means olive oil, unless some qualifying name indicates another oil. A corresponding use was made of shemen, and the oil referred to so many times in the Bible was olive oil (except Es 2:12). Compare this with the Greek elaion, &quot;oil,&quot; a neuter noun from elaia, &quot;olive,&quot; the origin of the English word &quot;oil.&quot; yitshar, literally, &quot;glistening,&quot; which occurs less frequently, is used possibly because of the light-giving quality of olive oil, or it may have been used to indicate fresh oil, as the clean, newly pressed oil is bright. meshach, a Chaldaic word, occurs twice: Ezr 6:9; 7:22. elaion, is the New Testament term.2. Production and Storage:Olive oil has been obtained, from the earliest times, by pressing the fruit in such a way as to filter out the oil and other liquids from the residue. The Scriptural references correspond so nearly to the methods practiced in Syria up to the present time, and the presses uncovered by excavators at such sites as Gezer substantiate so well the similarity of these methods, that a description of the oil presses and modes of expression still being employed in Syria will be equally true of those in use in early Israelite times.The olives to yield the greatest amount of oil are allowed to ripen, although some oil is expressed from the green fruit. As the olive ripens it turns black. The fruit begins to fall from the trees in September, but the main crop is gathered after the first rains in November. The olives which have not fallen naturally or have not been blown off by the storms are beaten from the trees with long poles (compare De 24:20). The fruit is gathered from the ground into baskets and carried on the heads of the women, or on donkeys to the houses or oil presses. Those carried to the houses are preserved for eating. Those carried to the presses are piled in heaps until fermentation begins. This breaks down the oil cells and causes a more abundant flow of oil. The fruit thus softened may be trod out with the feet (Mic 6:15)--which is now seldom practiced--or crushed in a handmill. Such a mill was uncovered at Gezer beside an oil press. Stone mortars with wooden pestles are also used. Any of these methods crushes the fruit, leaving only the stone unbroken, and yields a purer oil (Ex 27:20). The method now generally practiced of crushing the...</p>

It is a pretty shrub with sweet-smelling white flowers and silver-grey-green leaves. It is difficult to see how all the three references can apply to this tree; it will suit the first two, but this small shrub would never supply wood for carpentry work such as that mentioned in 1 Kings, hence, the translation &quot;olive wood.&quot; On the other hand, in the reference in Ne 8:15, olive branches are mentioned just before, so the translation &quot;wild olive&quot; (the difference being too slight) is improbable.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">oint&#x27;-ment: The present use of the word &quot;ointment&quot; is to designate a thick unguent of buttery or tallow-like consistency. the King James Version in frequent instances translates shemen or meshach (see Ex 30:25) &quot;ointment&quot; where a perfumed oil seemed to be indicated. the American Standard Revised Version has consequently substituted the word &quot;oil&quot; in most of the passages. Merqachah is rendered &quot;ointment&quot; once in the Old Testament (Job 41:31 (Hebrew 41:23)). The well-known power of oils and fats to absorb odors was made use of by the ancient perfumers. The composition of the holy anointing oil used in the tabernacle worship is mentioned in Ex 30:23-25. Olive oil formed the base. This was scented with &quot;flowing myrrh .... sweet cinnamon .... sweet calamus .... and .... cassia.&quot; The oil was probably mixed with the above ingredients added in a powdered form and heated until the oil had absorbed their odors and then allowed to stand until the insoluble matter settled, when the oil could be decanted. Olive oil, being a non-drying oil which does not thicken readily, yielded an ointment of oily consistency. This is indicated by Ps 133:2, where it says that the precious oil ran down on Aaron&#x27;s beard and on the collar of his outer garment. Anyone attempting to make the holy anointing oil would be cut off from his people (Ex 30:33). The scented oils or ointments were kept in jars or vials (not boxes) made of alabaster. These jars are frequently found as part of the equipment of ancient tombs.The word translated &quot;ointment&quot; in the New Testament is muron, &quot;myrrh.&quot; This would indicate that myrrh, an aromatic gum resin, was the substance commonly added to the oil to give it odor. In Lu 7:46 both kinds of oil are mentioned, and the verse might be paraphrased thus: My head with common oil thou didst not anoint; but she hath anointed my feet with costly scented oil.For the uses of scented oils or ointments see ANOINTING; OIL.James A.

The Narrative:The narrative of 1Ki 13:11-32, in which the old prophet is mentioned, is part of a larger account telling of a visit paid to Bethel by &quot;a man of God&quot; from Judah. The Judean prophet uttered a curse upon the altar erected there by Jeroboam I. When the king attempted to use force against him, the prophet was saved by divine intervention; the king then invited him to receive royal hospitality, but he refused because of a command of God to him not to eat or drink there. The Judean then departed (13:1-10). An old prophet who lived in Bethel heard of the stranger&#x27;s words, and went after him and offered him hospitality. This offer too was refused. But when the old prophet resorted to falsehood and pleaded a divine command on the subject, the Judean returned with him. While at table the old prophet is given a message to declare that death will follow the southerner&#x27;s disobedience to the first command. A lion kills him on his way home. The old prophet hears of the death and explains it as due to disobedience to God; he then buries the dead body in his own grave and expresses a wish that he also at death should be buried in the same sepulcher.2. Critical:There are several difficulties in the text. In 1Ki 13:11, the King James Version reads &quot;his sons came&quot; instead of &quot;one of his sons came,&quot; and translation 1Ki 13:12 b: &quot;And his sons shewed the way the man of God went.&quot; There is a gap in the Massoretic Text after the word &quot;table&quot; in 13:20; and 13:23 should be translated, &quot;And it came to pass after he had eaten bread and drunk water, that he saddled for himself the ass, and departed again&quot; (following Septuagint, B with W. B. Stevenson, HDB, III, 594a, note).Benzinger (&quot;Die Bucher der Konige,&quot; Kurz. Hand-Komm. zum Altes Testament, 91) holds that we have here an example of a midrash, i.e. according to LOT, 529, &quot;an imaginative development of a thought or theme suggested by Scripture, especially a didactic or homiletic exposition or an edifying religious story.&quot; 2Ch 24:27 refers to a &quot;midhrash of the book of the kings,&quot; and 2Ch 13:22 to a &quot;midrash of the prophet Iddo.&quot; In 2Ch 9:29 we have a reference to &quot;the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat.&quot; Josephus names the Judean prophet Jadon (Ant., VIII, viii, 5), and so some would trace this narrative to the midrash of Iddo, which would be a late Jewish work. There is a trace of late Hebrew in 1Ki 13:3, and evidence in several places of a later editing of the original narrative. Kittel and Benzinger think it possible that the section may be based on a historical incident. If the narrative is historical in the main, the mention of Josiah by name in 13:2 may be a later insertion; if not historical, the prophecy there is ex eventu, and the whole section a midrash on 2Ki 23:15-20.3.

The Olive Tree:The olive tree has all through history been one of the most characteristic, most valued and most useful of trees in Palestine. It is only right that it is the first named &quot;king&quot; of the trees (Jud 9:8,9). When the children of Israel came to the land they acquired olive trees which they planted not (De 6:11; compare Jos 24:13). The cultivation of the olive goes back to the earliest times in Canaan. The frequent references in the Bible, the evidences (see 4 below) from archaeology and the important place the product of this tree has held in the economy of the inhabitants of Syria make it highly probable that this land is the actual home of the cultivated olive. The wild olive is indigenous there. The most fruitful trees are the product of bare and rocky ground (compare De 32:13) situated preferably at no great distance from the sea. The terraced hills of Palestine, where the earth lies never many inches above the limestone rocks, the long rainless summer of unbroken sunshine, and the heavy &quot;clews&quot; of the autumn afford conditions which are extraordinarily favorable to at least the indigenous olive.The olive, Olea Europaea (Natural Order Oleaceae), is a slow-growing tree, requiring years of patient labor before reaching full fruitfulness. Its growth implies a certain degree of settlement and peace, for a hostile army can in a few days destroy the patient work of two generations. Possibly this may have something to do with its being the emblem of peace. Enemies of a village or of an individual often today carry out revenge by cutting away a ring of bark from the trunks of the olives, thus killing the trees in a few months. The beauty of this tree is referred to in Jer 11:16; Ho 14:6, and its fruitfulness in Ps 128:3. The characteristic olive-green of its foliage, frosted silver below and the twisted and gnarled trunks--often hollow in the center--are some of the most picturesque and constant signs of settled habitations. In some parts of the land large plantations occur: the famous olive grove near Beirut is 5 miles square; there are also fine, ancient trees in great numbers near Bethlehem.In starting an oliveyard the fellah not infrequently plants young wild olive trees which grow plentifully over many parts of the land, or he may grow from cuttings. When the young trees are 3 years old they are grafted from a choice stock and after another three or four years they may commence to bear fruit, but they take quite a decade more before reaching full fruition. Much attention is, however, required. The soil around the trees must be frequently plowed and broken up; water must be conducted to the roots from the earliest rain, and the soil must be freely enriched with a kind of marl known in Arabic as chuwwarah. If neglected, the older trees soon send up a great many shoots from the roots all aroun...</p>

Names:Josephus frequently uses the expression &quot;Mount of Olives&quot; (e.g. Ant, VII, ix, 2; XX, viii, 6; BJ, V, ii, 3; xii, 2), but later Jewish writings give the name har ha-mishchah, &quot;Mount of Oil&quot;; this occurs in some manuscripts in 2Ki 23:13, and the common reading har ha-mashchith, &quot;Mount of Corruption,&quot; margin &quot;destruction,&quot; may possibly be a deliberate alteration (see below). In later ages the Mount was termed &quot;the mountain of lights,&quot; because here there used to be kindled at one time the first beacon light to announce throughout Jewry the appearance of the new moon.To the natives of Palestine today it is usually known as Jebel et Tar (&quot;mountain of the elevation,&quot; or &quot;tower&quot;), or, less commonly, as Jebel Tur ez zait (&quot;mountain of the elevation of oil&quot;). The name Jebel ez-zaitun (&quot;Mount of Olives&quot;) is also well known. Early Arabic writers use the term Tur Zait, &quot;Mount of Oil.&quot;2. Situation and Extent:The mountain ridge which lies East of Jerusalem leaves the central range near the valley of Sha`phat and runs for about 2 miles due South. After culminating in the mountain mass on which lies the &quot;Church of the Ascension,&quot; it may be considered as giving off two branches: one lower one, which runs South-Southwest, forming the southern side of the Kidron valley, terminating at the Wady en Nar, and another, higher one, which slopes eastward and terminates a little beyond el-`Azareyeh (modern Bethany). The main ridge is considerably higher than the site of ancient Jerusalem, and still retains a thick cap of the soft chalky limestone, mixed with flint, known variously as Nari and Ka`kuli, which has been entirely denuded over the Jerusalem site (see JERUSALEM, II, 1). The flints were the cause of a large settlement of paleolithic man which occurred in prehistoric times on the northern end of the ridge, while the soft chalky stone breaks down to form a soil valuable for the cultivation of olives and other trees and shrubs. The one drawback to arboriculture upon this ridge is the strong northwest wind which permanently bends most trees toward the Southeast, but affects the sturdy,...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">om-nip&#x27;-o-tens:1. Terms and Usage:The noun &quot;omnipotence&quot; is not found in the English Bible, nor any noun exactly corresponding to it in the original Hebrew or GreekThe adjective &quot;omnipotent&quot; occurs in Re 19:6 the King James Version; the Greek for this, pantokrator, occurs also in 2Co 6:18; Re 1:8; 4:8; 11:17; 15:3; 16:7,14; 19:15; 21:22 (in all of which the King James Version and the Revised Version (British and American) render &quot;almighty&quot;). It is also found frequently in the Septuagint, especially in the rendering of the divine names Yahweh tsebha&#x27;oth and &#x27;El Shadday. In pantokrator, the element of &quot;authority,&quot; &quot;sovereignty,&quot; side by side with that of &quot;power,&quot; makes itself more distinctly felt than it does to the modern ear in &quot;omnipotent,&quot; although it is meant to be included in the latter also. Compare further ho dunatos, in Lu 1:49.2. Inherent in Old Testament Names of God:The formal conception of omnipotence as worked out in theology does not occur in the Old Testament. The substance of the idea is conveyed in various indirect ways. The notion of &quot;strength&quot; is inherent in the Old Testament conception of God from the beginning, being already represented in one of the two divine names inherited by Israel from ancient Semitic religion, the name &#x27;El. According to one etymology it is also inherent in the other, the name &#x27;Elohim, and in this case the plural form, by bringing out the fullness of power in God, would mark an approach to the idea of omnipotence.See GOD, NAMES OF.In the patriarchal religion the conception of &quot;might&quot; occupies a prominent place, as is indicated by the name characteristic of this period, &#x27;El Shadday; compare Ge 17:1; 28:3; 35:11; 43:14; 48:3; 49:24,25; Ex 6:3. This name, however, designates the divine power as standing in the service of His covenant-relation to the patriarchs, as transcending Nature and overpowering it in the interests of redemption.Another divine name which signalizes this attribute is Yahweh tsebha&#x27;oth, Yahweh of Hosts. This name, characteristic of the prophetic period, describes God as the King surrounded and followed by the angelic hosts, and since the might of an oriental king is measured by the splendor of his retinue, as of great, incomparable power, the King Omnipotent (Ps 24:10; Isa 2:12; 6:3,5; 8:13; Jer 46:18; Mal 1:14).Still another name expressive of the same idea is &#x27;Abhir, &quot;Strong One,&quot; compounded with Jacob or Israel (Ge 49:24; Ps 132:2,5; Isa 1:24; 49:26; 60:16). Further, &#x27;El Gibbor, &quot;God-Hero&quot; (Isa 9:6 (of the Messiah); compare for the adjective gibbor, Jer 20:11); and the figurative designation of God as Tsur, &quot;Rock,&quot; occurring especially in the address to God in the Psalter (Isa 30:29, the King James Version &quot;Mighty One&quot;). The specific energy with which the divine nature operates finds expression also in the name &#x27;El Chay, &quot;Living God,&quot; which God bears over against the impotent idols (1Sa 17:26,36; 2Ki 19:4,16; Ps 18:46; Jer 23:36; Da 6:20,26 f).

Non-Occurrence of the Term in Scripture:Neither the noun &quot;omnipresence&quot; nor adjective &quot;omnipresent&quot; occurs in Scripture, but the idea that God is everywhere present is throughout presupposed and sometimes explicitly formulated. God&#x27;s omnipresence is closely related to His omnipotence and omniscience: that He is everywhere enables Him to act everywhere and to know all things, and, conversely, through omnipotent action and omniscient knowledge He has access to all places and all secrets (compare Ps 139). Thus conceived, the attribute is but the correlate of the monotheistic conception of God as the Infinite Creator, Preserver and Governor of the universe, immanent in His works as well as transcendent above them.2. Philosophical and Popular Ideas of Omnipresence:The philosophical idea of omnipresence is that of exemption from the limitations of space, subjectively as well as objectively; subjectively, in so far as space, which is a necessary form of all created consciousness in the sphere of sense-perception, is not thus constitutionally inherent in the mind of God; objectively, in so far as the actuality of space-relations in the created world imposes no limit upon the presence and operation of God. This metaphysical conception of transcendence above all space is, of course, foreign to the Bible, which in regard to this, as in regard to the other transcendent attributes, clothes the truth of revelation in popular language, and speaks of exemption from the limitations of space in terms and figures derived from space itself. Thus, the very term &quot;omnipresence&quot; in its two component parts &quot;everywhere&quot; and &quot;present&quot; contains a double inadequacy of expression, both the notion of &quot;everywhere&quot; and that of &quot;presence&quot; being spacial concepts. Another point, in regard to which the popular nature of the Scriptural teaching on this subject must be kept in mind, concerns the mode of the divine omnipresence. In treating the concept philosophically, it is of importance to distinguish between its application to the essence, to the activity, and to the knowledge of God. The Bible does not draw these distinctions in the abstract. Although sometimes it speaks of God&#x27;s omnipresence with reference to the pervasive immanence of His being, it frequently contents itself with affirming the universal extent of God&#x27;s power and knowledge (De 4:39; 10:14; Ps 139:6-16; Pr 15:3; Jer 23:23,24; Am 9:2).3. Theories Denying Omnipresence of Being:This observation has given rise to theories of a mere omnipresence of power or omnipresence by an act of will, as distinct from an omnipresence of being. But it is plain that in this antithetical form such a distinction is foreign to the intent of the Biblical statements in question. The writers in these passages content themselves with describing the practical effects of the attribute without reflecting upon the difference between this and its ontological aspect; the latter is neither affirmed nor denied. That no denial of t...</p>

Words and Usage:In the Old Testament it is expressed in connection with such words as da&#x27;ath, binah, tebhunah, chokhmah; also &quot;seeing&quot; and &quot;hearing,&quot; &quot;the eye&quot; and &quot;the ear&quot; occur as figures for the knowledge of God, as &quot;arm,&quot; &quot;hand,&quot; &quot;finger&quot; serve to express His power. In the New Testament are found ginoskein, gnosis, eidenai, sophia, in the same connections.2. Tacit Assumption and Explicit Affirmation:Scripture everywhere teaches the absolute universality of the divine knowledge. In the historical books, although there is no abstract formula, and occasional anthropomorphic references to God&#x27;staking knowledge of things occur (Ge 11:5; 18:21; De 8:3), none the less the principle is everywhere presupposed in what is related about God&#x27;s cognizance of the doings of man, about the hearing of prayer, the disclosing of the future (1Sa 16:7; 23:9-12; 1Ki 8:39; 2Ch 16:9). Explicit affirmation of the principle is made in the Psalter, the Prophets, the chokhmah literature and in the New Testament. This is due to the increased internalizing of religion, by which its hidden side, to which the divine omniscience corresponds, receives greater emphasis (Job 26:6; 28:24; 34:22; Ps 139:12; 147:4; Pr 15:3,11; Isa 40:26; Ac 1:24; Heb 4:13; Re 2:23).3. Extends to All Spheres:This absolute universality is affirmed with reference to the various categories that comprise within themselves all that is possible or actual. It extends to God&#x27;s own being, as well as to what exists outside of Him in the created world. God has perfect possession in consciousness of His own being. The unconscious finds no place in Him (Ac 15:18; 1 Joh 1:5). Next to Himself God knows the world in its totality. This knowledge extends to small as well as to great affairs (Mt 6:8,32; 10:30); to the hidden heart and mind of man as well as to that which is open and manifest (Job 11:11; 34:21,23; Ps 14:2; 17:2 ff; 33:13-18; 102:19 f; 139:1-4; Pr 5:21; 15:3; Isa 29:15; Jer 17:10; Am 4:13; Lu 16:15; Ac 1:24; 1Th 2:4; Heb 4:13; Re 2:23). It extends to all the divisions of time, the past, present and future alike (Job 14:17; Ps 56:8; Isa 41:22-24; 44:6-8; Jer 1:5; Ho 13:12; Mal 3:16). It embraces that which is contingent from the human viewpoint as well as that which is certain (1Sa 23:9-12; Mt 11:22,23).4. Mode of the Divine Knowledge:Scripture brings God&#x27;s knowledge into connection with His omnipresence. Ps 139 is the clearest expression of this. Omniscience is the omnipresence of cognition (Jer 23:23). It is also closely related to God&#x27;s eternity, for the latter makes Him in His knowledge independent of the limitations of time (Isa 43:8-12). God&#x27;s creative relation to all that exists is represented as underlying His omniscience (Ps 33:15; 97:9; 139:13; Isa 29:15). His all-comprehensive purpose forms the basis of His knowledge of all events and developments (Isa 41:22-27; Am 3:7).This, however, does n...</p>

Omri reigned 12 years, circa 887-876 BC. The historical sources of his reign are contained in 1Ki 16:15-28; 20:34, the Moabite Stone, Assyrian inscriptions, and in the published accounts of recent excavations in Samaria. In spite of the brief passage given to Omri in the Old Testament, he was one of the most important of the military kings of Northern Israel.1. His Accession:Omri is first mentioned as an officer in the army of Elah, which was engaged in the siege of the Philistine town of Gibbethon. While Omri was thus engaged, Zimri, another officer of Elah&#x27;s army, conspired against the king, whom he assassinated in a drunken debauch, exterminating at the same time the remnant of the house of Baasha. The conspiracy evidently lacked the support of the people, for the report that Zimri had usurped the throne no sooner reached the army at Gibbethon, than the people proclaimed Omri, the more powerful military leader, king over Israel. Omri lost not a moment, but leaving Gibbethon in the hands of the Philistines, he marched to Tirzah, which he besieged and captured, while Zimri perished in the flames of the palace to which he had set fire with his own hands (1Ki 16:18). Omri, however, had still another opponent in Tibni the son of Ginath, who laid claim to the throne and who was supported in his claims by his brother Joram (1Ki 16:22 Septuagint) and by a large number of the people. Civil war-followed this rivalry for the throne, which seems to have lasted for a period of four years (compare 1Ki 16:15, with 16:23 and 29) before Omri gained full control.Omri&#x27;s military ability is seen from his choice of Samaria as the royal residence and capital of the Northern Kingdom. This step may have been suggested to Omri by his own easy conquest of Tirzah, the former capital. Accordingly, he purchased the hill Shomeron of Shemer for two talents of silver, about $4,352.00 in American money. The conical hill, which rose from the surrounding plain to the height of 400 ft., and on the top of which there was room for a large city, was capable of easy defense.2. The Founding of Samaria:The superior strategic importance of Samaria is evidenced by the sieges it endured repeatedly by the Syrians and Assyrians. It was finally taken by Sargon in 722, after the siege had lasted for 3 years. That the Northern Kingdom endured as long as it did was due largely to the strength of its capital. With the fall of Samaria, the nation fell.Recent excavations in Samaria under the direction of Harvard University throw new light upon the ancient capital of Israel. The first results were the uncovering of massive foundation walls of a large building, including a stairway 80 ft. wide. This building, which is Roman in architecture, is supposed to have been a temple, the work of Herod. Under this Roman building was recover...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">on (&#x27;on; Egyptian An, Ant, Annu, probably pronounced An only, as this is often all that is written, a &quot;stone&quot; or &quot;stone pillars&quot;): Later called Hellopolis. The name On occurs only in Ge 41:45,50; 46:20. It occurs in one other place in the Septuagint (Ex 1:11), where On is mentioned with Pithom and Raamses as strong cities which the Israelites built. Hebrew slaves may have worked upon fortifications here, but certainly did not build the city. On is possibly referred to as `ir ha-herec, in Isa 19:18 (see IR-HA-HERES). On may also be mentioned by Jeremiah (43:13) under the name Beth-shemesh. Ezekiel speaks of an Aven (&#x27;awen) (Eze 30:17), where it is mentioned with Pibeseth (Bubastis). Aven in this passage is almost certainly the same as On in Ge 41:45; 46:20, as the letters of both words are the same in the Hebrew. Only the placing of the vowel-points makes any difference. If there is a mistake, it is a mistake of the Massoretes, not of the Hebrew writer.1. Location and Description:There were two Ons in Egypt: one in Upper Egypt, An-res (Hermonthis); the other in Lower Egypt, An-Meheet (Brugsch, Geogr. Inschr., 254, 255, numbers 1217, a, b, 1218, 8708, 1225). The latter is the On referred to in the Bible. It lay about 20 miles North of the site of old Memphis, about 10 miles Northeast of the location of modern Cairo. It has left until this time about 4 square miles of ruins within the old walls. Little or nothing remains outside the walls.On was built at the edge of the desert, which has now retreated some 3 or 4 miles eastward, the result of the rising of the bed of the Nile by sediment from the inundation, and the broadening of the area of infiltration which now carries the water of the Nile that much to the East. The land around On has risen about 10 ft., and the waters of infiltration at the time of lowest Nile are now about 1 1/2 ft. above the floor-level of the temple.2. History:The history of On is very obscure, yet its very great importance is in no doubt. No clear description of the ancient city or sanctuary has come down to us, but there are so many incidental references, and so much is implied in ancient records, that it stands out as of the very first importance, both as capital and sanctuary. The city comes from the Ist Dynasty, when it was the seat of government, and indeed must have been founded by the Ist Dynasty or have come down to it from pre-historic time. From the IIIrd to the VIth Dynasty the seat of government was shifted from On to Memphis, and in the XIIth Dynasty to Diospolis. Throughout these changes On retained its religious importance. It had been the great sanctuary in the time of the Pyramid Texts, the oldest religious texts of Egypt, and judging from the evident great development of the temple of On at the time of the writing of the texts, the city must have antedated them by considerable time (Budge, History of Egypt, II, 83, 84, 108; Breasted, Development of Religion and Thought in Egypt, chapters i, ii).

With Paul in Rome:Onesimus was a slave (Phm 1:16) belonging to Philemon who was a wealthy citizen of Colosse, and a prominent member of the church there. Onesimus was still a heathen when he defrauded his master and ran off from Colosse. He found his way to Rome, where evil men tended to flock as to a common center, as Tacitus tells us they did at that period. In Rome he came into contact with Paul, who was then in his own hired house, in military custody.What brought him into contact with Paul we do not know. It may have been hunger; it may have been the pangs of conscience. He could not forget that his master&#x27;s house in Colosse was the place where the Christians met in their weekly assemblies for the worship of Christ. Neither could he forget how Philemon had many a time spoken of Paul, to whom he owed his conversion. Now that Onesimus was in Rome--what a strange coincidence--Paul also was in Rome.The result of their meeting was that Onesimus was converted to Christ, through the instrumentality of the apostle (&quot;my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds,&quot; Phm 1:10). His services had been very acceptable to Paul, who would gladly have kept Onesimus with him; but as he could not do this without the knowledge and consent of Philemon, he sent Onesimus back to Colosse, to his master there.2. Paul&#x27;s Epistles to Colosse and to Philemon:At the same time Paul wrote to the church in Colosse on other matters, and he entrusted the Epistle to the Colossians to the joint care of Tychicus and Onesimus. The apostle recommends Onesimus to the brethren in Colosse, as a &quot;faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you,&quot; and he goes on to say that Tychicus and Onesimus will make known to them all things that have happened to Paul in Rome. Such a commendation would greatly facilitate&#x27; Onesimus&#x27;s return to Colosse.But Paul does more. He furnishes Onesimus with a letter written by himself to Philemon. Returning to a city where it was well known that he had been neither a Christian nor even an honest man, he needed someone to vouch for the reality of the change which had taken place in his life. And Paul does this for him both in the Epistle to the Colossians and in that to Philemon.With what exquisite delicacy is Onesimus introduced! `Receive him,&#x27; says the apostle, `for he is my own very heart&#x27; (Phm 1:12). &quot;The man whom the Colossians had only known hitherto, if they knew him all, as a worthless runaway slave, is thus commended to them, as no more a slave but a brother, no more dishonest and faithless but trustworthy; no more an object of contempt but of love&quot; (Lightfoot&#x27;s Commentary on Col, 235).(1) Onesimus Profitable.The apostle accordingly begs Philemon to give Onesimus the same reception as he would rejoice to give to himself. The past history of Onesimus had been such as to belie the meaning of his name. He had not been &quot;profitable&quot;--far from it. But already his consistent condu...</p>

The Friend of Paul:Onesiphorus was a friend of the apostle Paul, who mentions him twice when writing to Timothy. In the former of the two passages where his name occurs, his conduct is contrasted with that of Phygellus and Hermogenes and others--all of whom, like Onesiphorus himself, were of the province of Asia--from whom Paul might well have expected to receive sympathy and help. These persons had &quot;turned away&quot; from him. Onesiphorus acted in a different way, for &quot;he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain; but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me.&quot;Onesiphorus was one of the Christians of the church in Ephesus; and the second passage, where his name is found, merely sends a message of greeting from Paul, which Timothy in Ephesus is requested to deliver to &quot;the household of Onesiphorus.&quot; (the King James Version).2. Visits Paul in Rome:Onesiphorus then had come from Ephesus to Rome. It was to Paul that the church at Ephesus owed its origin, and it was to him therefore that Onesiphorus and the Christians there were indebted for all that they knew of Christ. Onesiphorus gratefully remembered these facts, and having arrived in Rome, and learned that Paul was in prison, he &quot;very diligently&quot; sought for the apostle. But to do this, though it was only his duty, involved much personal danger at that particular time. For the persecution, inaugurated by Nero against the Christians, had raged bitterly; its fury was not yet abated, and this made the profession of the Christian name a matter which involved very great risk of persecution and of death.Paul was not the man to think lightly of what his Ephesian friend had done. He remembered too, &quot;in how many things he ministered at Ephesus.&quot; And, writing to Timothy, he reminded him that Onesiphorus&#x27;s kindly ministrations at Ephesus were already well known to him, from his residence in Ephesus, and from his position, as minister of the church there.It should be observed that the ministration of Onesiphorus at Ephesus was not, as the King James Version gives it, &quot;to me,&quot; that is, to Paul himself. &quot;To me&quot; is omitted in the Revised Version (British and American). What Onesiphorus had done there was a wide Christian ministry of kindly action; it embraced &quot;many things,&quot; which were too well known--for such is the force of the word--to Timothy to require repetition.The visits which Onesiphorus paid to Paul in his Roman prison were intensely &quot;refreshing.&quot; And it was not once or twice that he thus visited the chained prisoner, but he did so ofttimes.3. His Household:Though Onesiphorus had come to Rome, his household had remained in Ephesus; and a last salutation is sent to them by Paul. He could not write again, as he was now ready to be offered, and his execution could not long be delayed. But as he writes, he entertains the kindest feelings toward Onesiphorus and his household, and he prays that the Lord will g...</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">o-ni&#x27;-as (Onias): There were 3 high priests of the name of Onias, and a 4th Onias who did not become a high priest but was known as the builder of the temple of Leontopolis (Josephus, Ant, XIII, iii, 1-3). Only two persons of the name are mentioned in the Apocrypha--Onias I and Onias III.(1) Onias I, according to Josephus (Ant., XI, viii, 7), the son of Jaddua and father of Simon the Just (ibid., XII, ii, 5; Sirach 50), and, according to 1 Macc 12:7,20, a contemporary of Areus (Arius), king of Sparta, who reigned 309-265 BC (Diod. xx.29). This Onias was the recipient of a friendly letter from Areus of Sparta (1 Macc 12:7; see manuscripts readings here, and 12:20). Josephus (Ant., XII, iv, 10) represents this letter as written to Onias III, which is an error, for only two Areuses are known, and Areus II reigned about 255 BC and died a child of 8 years (Paus. iii.6,6). The letter--if genuine--exists in two copies (Josephus, Ant, XII, iv, 10, and 1 Macc 12:20 ff) (see Schurer, History of the Jewish People, 4th edition, I, 182 and 237).(2) Onias III, son of Simon II (Josephus, Ant, XII, iv, 10), whom he succeeded, and a contemporary of Seleucus IV and Antiochus Epiphanes (2 Macc 3:1; 4:7) and father of Onias IV. He was known for his godliness and zeal for the law, yet was on such friendly terms with the Seleucids that Seleucus IV Philopator defrayed the cost of the &quot;services of the sacrifices.&quot; He quarreled with Simon the Benjamite, guardian of the temple, about the market buildings (Greek aedileship). Being unable to get the better of Onias and thirsting for revenge, Simon went to Apollonius, governor of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, and informed him of the &quot;untold sums of money,&quot; lodged in the treasury of the temple. The governor told the king, and Seleucus dispatched his chancellor, Heliodorus, to remove the money. Onias remonstrated in vain, pleading for the &quot;deposits of widows and orphans.&quot; Heliodorus persisted in the object of his mission. The high priest and the people were in the greatest distress. But when Heliodorus had already entered the temple, &quot;the Sovereign of spirits, and of all authority caused a great apparition,&quot; a horse with a terrible rider accompanied by two strong and beautiful young men who scourged and wounded Heliodorus. At the intercession of Onias, his life was spared. Heliodorus advised the king to send on the same errand any enemy or conspirator whom he wished punished. Simon then slandered Onias, and the jealousy having caused bloodshed between their followers, Onias decided to repair in person to the king to intercede for his country. Apparently before a decision was given, Seleucus was assassinated and Epiphanes succeeded (175 BC). Jason, the brother of Onias, having offered the new king larger revenue, secured the priesthood, which he held until he himself was similarly supplanted by Menelaus, Simon&#x27;s brother (2 Macc 4:23; Josephus, Ant, XII, v, 1, says Jason&#x27;s brother).

It is used literally of an only child: &quot;the only son of his mother&quot; (Lu 7:12); &quot;an only daughter&quot; (Lu 8:42); &quot;mine only child&quot; (Lu 9:38); &quot;Isaac .... his only begotten&quot; (Heb 11:17). In all other places in the New Testament it refers to Jesus Christ as &quot;the only begotten Son of God&quot; (Joh 1:14,18; 3:16,18; 1 Joh 4:9). In these passages, too, it might be translated as &quot;the only son of God&quot;; for the emphasis seems to be on His uniqueness, rather than on His sonship, though both ideas are certainly present. He is the son of God in a sense in which no others are. &quot;Monogenes describes the absolutely unique relation of the Son to the Father in His divine nature; prototokos describes the relation of the Risen Christ in His glorified humanity to man&quot; (Westcott on Heb 1:6). Christ&#x27;s uniqueness as it appears in the above passages consists of two things:(a) He reveals the Father: &quot;No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him&quot; (Joh 1:18). Men therefore behold His glory, &quot;glory as of the only begotten from the Father&quot; (1:14).(b) He is the mediator of salvation: &quot;God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him&quot; (1 Joh 4:9; Joh 3:16); &quot;He that believeth not (on him) hath been judged already&quot; (Joh 3:18). Other elements in His uniqueness may be gathered from other passages, as His sinlessness, His authority to forgive sins, His unbroken communion with the Father, and His unique knowledge of Him. To say that it is a uniqueness of nature or essence carries thought no farther, for these terms still need definition, and they can be defined only in terms of His moral consciousness, of His revelation of God, and especially of His intimate union as Son with the Father.See also BEGOTTEN; PERSON OF CHRIST; SON OF GOD.The reading &quot;God only begotten&quot; in Joh 1:18 the Revised Version margin, though it has strong textual support, is improbable, and can well be explained as due to orthodox zeal, in opposition to adoptionism.

The form &quot;onycha&quot; was perhaps chosen to avoid confusion with &quot;onyx,&quot; the stone. The Hebrew shecheleth occurs only in Ex 30:34 as an ingredient of the sacred incense. It is supposed to denote the horny operculum found in certain species of marine gasteropod molluscs. The operculum is a disk attached to the upper side of the hinder part of the &quot;foot&quot; of the mollusc. When the animal draws itself into its shell, the hinder part of the foot comes last, and the operculum closes the mouth of the shell. The operculum, which may be horny or stony, is absent in some species. The horny opercula when burned emit a peculiar odor, and are still used in combination with other perfumes by the Arab women of Upper Egypt and Nubia. (See Sir S. Baker, The Nile Tributaries of Abyssinia, cited by EB, under the word &quot;Onycha.&quot;)Alfred Ely Day</p>

The Revised Version (British and American) has corrected; see ENAIM.(2) In 1Ki 22:10 parallel 2Ch 18:9 the Revised Version (British and American) relates that Ahab and Jehoshaphat sat &quot;each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place (margin &quot;Hebrew: a threshing-floor,&quot; the King James Version &quot;a void place&quot;) at the entrance of the gate of Samaria.&quot; The Hebrew here is awkward, and neither the Septuagint nor the Syriac seems to have read the present text in 1Ki 22:10, the former having &quot;in arms, at the gate of Samaria,&quot; and the latter &quot;in many-colored garments.&quot; Consequently various attempts have been made to emend the text, of which the simplest is the omission of beghoren, &quot;in an open place.&quot; If, however, the text is right--as is not impossible--the open place is a threshing-floor close to the gate.

Meaning of Name:There has been considerable divergence of opinion with regard to the meaning of this name. Thus, in all the references given above with the article, the Revised Version (British and American) has simply &quot;Ophel,&quot; but the King James Version adds in margin &quot;the tower&quot;; in Isa 32:14, &quot;the hill&quot; with margin &quot;Ophel,&quot; but the King James Version &quot;the forts,&quot; margin &quot;clifts&quot;; Mic 4:8, &quot;the hill,&quot; margin &quot;Hebrew: Ophel,&quot; but the King James Version &quot;the stronghold&quot;; 2Ki 5:24, &quot;the hill,&quot; margin &quot;Hebrew: Ophel,&quot; but the King James Version &quot;the tower,&quot; margin &quot;secret place.&quot; It is true that the other occurrences of the word in 1Sa 5:9,12; 6:5 f, where it is translated &quot;tumors,&quot; and Hab 2:4, where a verbal form is translated &quot;puffed up,&quot; seem to imply that one meaning assigned to the root may be that of &quot;swelling.&quot; Recently Dr. Burney (PEF, January, 1911) has produced strong arguments in favor of Ophel, when used as the name of a locality, meaning &quot;fortress.&quot;2. Three Ophels:Three places are known to have received this name:(1) A certain place on the east hill of Jerusalem, South of the temple; to this all the passages quoted above--except one--refer.(2) The &quot;Ophel,&quot; translated &quot;hill,&quot; situated apparently in Samaria (compare 2Ki 5:3), where Gehazi took his ill-gotten presents from the hands of the servants of Naaman the Syrian. The translation &quot;tower&quot; would suit the sense at least as well. It was some point probably in the wall of Samaria, perhaps the citadel itself.(3) The third reference is not Biblical, but on the Moabite Stone, an inscription of Mesha, king of Moab, contemporary with Omri. He says: &quot;I built Q-R-CH-H (? Karhah), the wall of ye`arim, and the wall of `Ophel and I built its gates and I built its towers.&quot;In comparing the references to (1) and (3), it is evident that if Ophel means a &quot;hill,&quot; it certainly was a fortified hill, and it seems highly probable that it meant some &quot;artificial swelling in a fortification, e.g. a bulging or rounded keep or enceinte&quot; (Burney, loc. cit.). Isa 32:14 reads, &quot;The palace shall be forsaken; the populous city shall be deserted; the hill (Ophel) and the watch-tower shall be for dens for ever.&quot; Here we have palace, city and watch-tower, all the handiwork of the builder. Does it not seem probable that the Ophel belongs to the same category?3. The Ophel of Jerusalem:The situation of the Ophel of Jerusalem is very definitely described. It was clearly, from the references (Ne 3:26,27; 2Ch 27:3; 33:14), on the east hill South of the temple. Josephus states (Josephus, Jewish Wars, V, iv, 2) that the eastern wall of the city ran from Siloam &quot;and reaches as far as a certain place which they called Ophlas when it was joined to the eastern cloister of the temple.&quot; In BJ, V, vi, 1, it states that &quot;John held the temple and the parts thereto adjoining, for a great way, as also `Ophla,&#x27; and the Vall...</p>

Scriptural References:The 11th in order of the sons of Joktan (Ge 10:29 equals 1Ch 1:23). There is a clear reference also to a tribe Ophir (Ge 10:30). Ophir is the name of a land or city somewhere to the South or Southeast of Palestine for which Solomon&#x27;s ships along with Phoenician vessels set out from Ezion-geber at the head of the Gulf of Aqabah, returning with great stores of gold, precious stones and &quot;almug&quot;-wood (1Ki 9:28; 10:11; 2Ch 9:10; 1Ki 22:48; 2Ch 8:18). We get a fuller list of the wares and also the time taken by the voyage if we assume that the same vessels are referred to in 1Ki 10:22, &quot;Once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.&quot; The other products may not have been native to the land of Ophir, but it is certain that the gold at least was produced there. This gold was proverbial for its purity, as is witnessed by many references in the Old Testament (Ps 45:9; Job 28:16; Isa 13:12; 1Ch 29:4), and, in Job 22:24, Ophir is used for fine gold itself. In addition to these notices of Ophir, it is urged that the name. occurs also in two passages under the form &quot;Uphaz&quot; (Jer 10:9; Da 10:5).2. Geographical Position:At all times the geographical position of Ophir has been a subject of dispute, the claims of three different regions being principally advanced, namely(1) India and the Far East,(2) Africa,(3) Arabia.(1) India and the Far East.All the wares mentioned are more or less appropriate to India, even including the fuller list of 1Ki 10:22. &quot;Almug&quot;-wood is conjectured to be the Indian sandal-wood. Another argument is based on the resemblance between the Septuagint form of the word (Sophera) and the Coptic name for India (Sophir). A closer identification is sought with Abhira, a people dwelling at the mouths of the Indus. Supara, an ancient city on the west coast of India near the modern Goa, is also suggested. Again, according to Wildman, the name denotes a vague extension eastward, perhaps as far as China.(2) Africa.This country is the greatest gold-producing region of the three. Sofala, a seaport near Mozambique on the east coast of Africa, has been advanced as the site of Ophir, both on linguistic grounds and from the nature of its products, for there all the articles of 1Ki 10:22 could be procured. But Gesenius shows that Sofala is merely the Arabic form of the Hebrew shephelah. Interest in this region as the land of Ophir was renewed, however, by Mauch&#x27;s discovery at Zimbabye of great ruins and signs of old Phoenician civilization and worked-out gold mines. According to Bruce (I, 440), a voyage from Sofala to Ezion-geber would have occupied quite three years owing to the monsoons.(3) Arabia.The claim of Southeastern Arabia as the land of Ophir has on the whole more to support it than that of India or of Africa. The Ophir of Ge 10:29 beyond doubt belonged to this region, and the search for Ophir in more...</p>

It is mentioned again in 1Sa 13:17. The Philistines who were encamped at Michmash sent out marauding bands, one of which went westward, another eastward, down &quot;the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness&quot;; the third &quot;turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual.&quot; This must have been northward, as Saul commanded the passage to the South. Eusebius, Onomasticon places it 5 Roman miles East of Bethel. A site which comes near to fulfilling these conditions is eT-Taiyebeh, which stands on a conical hill some 5 miles Northeast of Beitin. This is possibly identical with &quot;Ephron&quot; (2Ch 13:19), and &quot;Ephraim&quot; (Jn. 11:54).(2) A city in the tribal lot of Manasseh West of Jordan. It is mentioned only in connection with Gideon, whose native place it was, and with his son Abimelech (Jud 6:11, etc.). It was, indeed, family property, belonging to Joash the Abiezrite, the father of Gideon. It was apparently not far from the plain of Esdraelon (Jud 6:33 f), so that Gideon and his kinsmen smarted under the near presence of the oppressing Midianites. Manasseh, of course, as bordering on the southern edge of the plain, was in close touch with the invaders. At Ophrah, Gideon reared his altar to Yahweh, and made thorough cleansing of the instruments of idolatry. After his great victory, he set up here the golden ephod made from the spoils of the enemy, which proved a snare to himself and to his house (Jud 8:27). Here he was finally laid to rest. It was at Ophrah that Abimelech, aspiring to the kingdom, put to death upon one stone three score and ten of his brethren, as possible rivals, Jotham alone escaping alive (Jud 9:5). Apparently the mother of Abimelech belonged to Shechem; this established a relationship with that town, his connection with which does not therefore mean that Ophrah was near it.No quite satisfactory identification has yet been suggested. Conder (PEFS, 1876, 1971) quotes the Samaritan Chronicle as identifying Ferata, which is 6 miles West of Nablus, with an ancient Ophra, &quot;and the one that suggests itself as most probably identical is Ophrah of the Abiezerite.&quot; But this seems too far to the South.(3) A man of the tribe of Judah, son of Meonothai (1Ch 4:14).W.

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">o-presh&#x27;-un: Used in the King James Version to translate a variety of Hebrew words, all of which, however, agree in the general sense of wrong done by violence to others. There are a few cases where the reference is to the oppression of Israel by foreigners, as by their Egyptian masters (Ex 3:9; De 26:7), or by Syria (2Ki 13:4), or by an unmentioned nation (Isa 30:20 King James Version, margin). In all these cases the Hebrew original is lachats. But in the vast number of cases the reference is to social oppression of one kind or another within Israel&#x27;s own body. It is frequently theme of psalmist and prophet and wise man. The poor and weak must have suffered greatly at the hands of the stronger and more fortunate. The word lachats, various forms of the root `ashaq, and other words are used by the writers as they express their sorrow and indignation over the wrongs of their afflicted brethren. In his own sorrow, Job remembers the suffering of the oppressed (Job 35:9; 36:15); it is a frequent subject of song in the Psalms (Ps 12:5; 42:9; 43:2; 44:24; 55:3; 119:134); the preacher observes and reflects upon its prevalence (Ec 4:1; 5:8; 7:7 the King James Version); the prophets Amos (3:9), Isaiah (5:7; 59:13), Jeremiah (6:6; 22:17) and Ezekiel (22:7,29) thundered against it. It was exercised toward strangers and also toward the Israelites themselves, and was never wholly overcome. In Jas 2:6, &quot;oppress&quot; is the rendering of katadunasteuo, &quot;to exercise harsh control over one,&quot; &quot;to use one&#x27;s power against one.&quot;William Joseph Mcglothlin</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">or&#x27;-a-k&#x27;-l:(1) A divine utterance delivered to man, usually in answer to a request for guidance. So in 2Sa 16:23 for dabhar (&quot;word,&quot; as in the Revised Version margin). The use in this passage seems to indicate that at an early period oracular utterances were sought from Yahweh by the Israelites, but the practice certainly fell into disuse at the rise of prophecy, and there are no illustrations of the means employed (1Sa 14:18,19,36-42, etc., belong rather to DIVINATION (which see)). In. the Revised Version margin of such passages as Isa 13:1, &quot;oracle&quot; is used in the titles of certain special prophecies as a substitute for BURDEN (which see) (massa&#x27;), with considerable advantage (especially in La 2:14).(2) In heathen temples &quot;oracle&quot; was used for the chamber in which the utterances were delivered (naturally a most sacred part of the structure). This usage, coupled with a mistake in Hebrew philology (connecting debhir, &quot;hinder part,&quot; with dibber, &quot;speak&quot;), caused English Versions of the Bible to give the title &quot;oracle&quot; to the Most Holy Place of the Temple, in 1Ki 6:5, etc., following the example of Aquila, Symmachus and the Vulgate (Jerome&#x27;s Latin Bible, 390-405 A.D.) But the title is very unfortunate, as the Most Holy Place had nothing to do with the delivery of oracles, and the Revised Version (British and American) should have corrected (compare Ps 28:2 margin).(3) In the New Testament English Versions of the Bible employs &quot;oracle&quot; as the translation of logion, &quot;saying,&quot; in four places. In all, divine utterances are meant, specialized in Ac 7:38 as the Mosaic Law (&quot;living oracles&quot; equals &quot;commandments enforced by the living God&quot;), in Ro 3:2 as the Old Testament in general, and in Heb 5:12 as the revelations of Christianity (Heb 6:2,3). In 1Pe 4:11 the meaning is debated, but probably the command is addressed to those favored by a supernatural &quot;gift of speech.&quot; Such men must keep their own personality in the background, adding nothing of their own to the inspired message as it comes to them.Burton Scott Easton</p>

The proceedings, as was generally the case in the provincial Roman courts, would probably be conducted in Latin, and under Roman modes of procedure, in which the parties would not be well versed; hence, the need of a professional advocate. Rhetor is here the equivalent of the older Greek sunegoros, &quot;the prosecuting counsel,&quot; as opposed to the sundikos, &quot;the defendant&#x27;s advocate.&quot;Oration occurs only in Ac 12:21: &quot;Herod .... made an oration unto them&quot; (edemegorei pros autous). The verb demegoreo, &quot;to speak in an assembly&quot; (from demos, &quot;people,&quot; agoreuo, &quot;to harangue&quot;), is often found in classical Greek, generally in a bad sense (Latin concionari); here only in the New Testament.D.

This is due to the fact that the English word has many shades of meaning (especially as used in the time the King James Version was made), of which the following are the chief:(1) To set in order, arrange, prepare:&quot;All things that we ordained festival,Turn from their office to black funeral.&quot;--Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet, IV, v, 84.This meaning is now obsolete. It is found in the King James Version of Ps 132:17; Isa 30:33; Heb 9:6 (in each of which cases the Revised Version (British and American) or margin substitutes &quot;prepare&quot;); 1Ch 17:9 (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;appoint&quot;); Ps 7:13 (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;maketh&quot;); Hab 1:12 (also the Revised Version (British and American)).(2) To establish, institute, bring into being: &quot;When first this order (i.e. the Garter) was ordained, my Lord&quot; (Shakespeare). So in 1Ki 12:32, &quot;Jeroboam ordained a feast in the 8th month&quot; (12:33); Nu 28:6; Ps 8:2,3; Isa 26:12;  /RAPC 2Es 6:49 the King James Version (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;preserve&quot;); Sirach 7:15; Ga 3:19.(3) To decree, give orders, prescribe:&quot;And doth the power that man adoresOrdain their doom &quot; --Byron.So Es 9:27, &quot;The Jews ordained .... that they would keep these two days according to the writing thereof&quot;; 1 Esdras 6:34; 2 Esdras 7:17; 8:14 the King James Version; Tobit 1:6; 8:7 the King James Version (the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;command&quot;); Additions to Esther 14:9; 1 Macc 4:59; 7:49; Ac 16:4; Ro 7:10 the King James Version; 1Co 2:7; 7:17; 9:14; Eph 2:10 the King James Version.(4) To set apart for an office or duty, appoint, destine: &quot;Being ordained his special governor&quot; (Shakespeare). Frequent in EV. When the King James Version has &quot;ordain&quot; in this sense, the Revised Version (British and American) generally substitutes &quot;appoint&quot;; e.g. &quot;He (Jesus) appointed (the King James Version &quot;ordained&quot;) twelve, that they might be with him&quot; (Mr 3:14). So 2Ch 11:15; Jer 1:5; Da 2:24; 1 Esdras 8:49; 1Ma 3:55; 10:20; Joh 15:16; Ac 14:23; 1Ti 2:7; Tit 1:5; Heb 5:1; 8:3. The Revised Version (British and American) substitutes &quot;formedst&quot; in The Wisdom of Solomon 9:2, &quot;recorded&quot; in Sirach 48:10, &quot;become&quot; in Ac 1:22, &quot;written of&quot; (margin &quot;set forth&quot;) in Jude 1:4, but retains &quot;ordain&quot; in the sense of &quot;appoint,&quot; &quot;set apart,&quot; in 2Ki 23:5; 1Ch 9:22; 1 Esdras 8:23; Additions to Esther 13:6; Ac 10:42; 13:48; 17:31; Ro 13:1.(5) To appoint ceremonially to the ministerial or priestly office, to confer holy orders on.

Arrangement in Rows:The fundamental idea suggested by the Hebrew, Greek and English words is that of arrangement in rows. Thus &quot;order&quot; is used in the Bible of arranging wood for an altar (Le 1:7; 1Ki 18:33; compare Hebrew Ge 22:9; Isa 30:33); of laying out flax-stalks for drying (Jos 2:6); of preparing offerings (Le 1:8,12; compare Lu 6:5; Jud 6:26); of arranging lamps (Ex 27:21; 39:37; Le 24:3,4; compare Ps 132:17); of placing the shewbread on the table (Ex 40:4,23; Le 6:12; 24:8; 2Ch 13:11); of drawing up the battle array (1Ch 12:38 (Hebrew 39, `adhar)); and of arranging weapons in order for battle (Jer 46:3, the American Standard Revised Version &quot;prepare&quot;). As a verb &quot;to order&quot; in the older versions usually has the obsolete sense &quot;to arrange&quot; and not the more usual English meanings, &quot;to demand&quot; or &quot;to direct.&quot; Thus: &quot;In the tent of meeting shall Aaron order it&quot; (Le 24:4, the American Standard Revised Version &quot;keep in order&quot;); &quot;Order ye the buckler and shield&quot; (Jer 46:3; compare Ps 119:133; Job 23:4, the American Standard Revised Version &quot;set in order&quot;; Judith 2:16; The Wisdom of Solomon 8:1; 15:1; Ecclesiasticus 2:6). The Hebrew pa`am (literally, &quot;hoof-beat,&quot; &quot;occurrence,&quot; &quot;repetition&quot;) in the plural conveys the idea of an architectural plan (Eze 41:6). Another word, shalabh, literally, &quot;to join,&quot; in connection with the tabernacle, has in some versions been translated as including the idea of orderly arrangement (Ex 26:17). The word &quot;order&quot; standing by itself may mean orderly or proper arrangement (1 Esdras 1:10; The Wisdom of Solomon 7:29; 1 Macc 6:40; Col 2:5). Akin to the idea of arranging things in a row is that of arranging words (Job 33:5; 37:19; Ps 5:3), of recounting things in order (Isa 44:7; Lu 1:1 the King James Version (diatassein); Lu 1:3; Ac 11:4 (kathexes)), of setting forth a legal case (Job 23:4; 13:18; compare Ps 50:21). From the idea of arranging in order for the purpose of comparison the Hebrew `arakh acquires the meaning &quot;to compare&quot; (Isa 40:18; Ps 89:7). This is clearly the meaning of &#x27;en `arokh &#x27;elekha (Ps 40:5 (Hebrew 6)), where &quot;They cannot be set in order unto thee&quot; must be interpreted to mean &quot;There is nothing that can be compared unto thee.&quot;2. Sequence in Time:As the fundamental meaning of `arakh is arrangement in space, that of cadhar is order or sequence in time. In later Hebrew cedher was used in the sense of &quot;program.&quot; In Job 10:22 lo&#x27; cedharim, absence of regularity, in the description of the uncertain period that follows death probably means &quot;confusion in time.&quot; (The Septuagint (pheggos) suggests, in...</p>

Old Testament Use:This word generally represents chuqqah, something prescribed, enactment, usually with reference to matters of ritual. In the King James Version the same word is frequently translated by &quot;statute&quot; or &quot;statutes,&quot; which is also the rendering of a similar Hebrew word, namely, choq. the Revised Version (British and American) generally retains &quot;ordinance,&quot; but sometimes substitutes &quot;statute&quot; (e.g. Ex 18:20; Ps 99:7). In one instance the Revised Version (British and American) renders &quot;set portion&quot; (Eze 45:14). The word generally has a religious or ceremonial significance. It is used for instance in connection with the Passover (Ex 12:43; Nu 9:14). According to Ex 12:14, the Passover was &quot;an ordinance for ever,&quot; i.e. a permanent institution. In the plural the word is often employed, along with such terms as commandments, laws, etc., with reference to the different prescriptions of the Deuteronomic and Priestly codes (De 6:1,2; Le 18:4).In 11 passages (Ex 15:25; Jos 24:25; 1Sa 30:25; 2Ki 17:34,37; 2Ch 33:8; 35:13; Ps 119:91; Isa 58:2 twice; Eze 11:20) &quot;ordinance&quot; is the rendering of mishpaT, judgment, decision or sentence by a judge or ruler. In the Book of the Covenant (Ex 20:22-23:33) the term &quot;judgments&quot; denotes civil, as contrasted with ritual, enactments. In 2Ki 17:34 the King James Version employs &quot;manners&quot; and &quot;ordinances&quot; as renderings of this word. In 3 passages (Le 18:30; 22:9; Mal 3:14) &quot;ordinance&quot; is the translation of mishmereth, &quot;charge,&quot; which the Revised Version (British and American) restores. In one instance (Ne 10:32) ordinance renders mitswah, &quot;commandment,&quot; while in Ezr 3:10 the King James Version the phrase &quot;after the ordinance of David&quot; represents a Hebrew phrase which literally means &quot;upon the hands of David,&quot; i.e. under the guidance or direction of David.2. New Testament Use:In the New Testament, &quot;ordinance&quot; renders different Greek words, namely,(1) dikaioma, in Lu 1:6 and Heb 9:1,10. The word means literally, &quot;anything declared right&quot;; but in these passages ceremonial and religious regulation;(2) dogma, in Eph 2:15; Col 2:14. In the New Testament this word always means a decree or edict (Ac 17:7);(3) paradosis, in 1Co 11:2 the King James Version, the Revised Version (British and American) substitutes &quot;traditions&quot;;(4) ktisis, &quot;setting up,&quot; &quot;institution&quot; in 1Pe 2:13. The term is used exclusively of the action of God. Peter implies that institutions, apparently human, such as the family and the state, are of divine origin. The same doctrine is found in Ro 13:1.T.

Meaning of Names:As to the meaning of the two names, both words are found in Arabic. Robertson Smith, Kinship, etc. (190 ff, 218 ff), says that the use of the names of animals as names of persons is a relic of totemism. But Noldeke (ZDMG, XL, 160 ff) and others hold that such a use shows a desire that those so named should be as disagreeable to their enemies as the plant or animal which the name denoted. Some again (e.g. Stade, Geschichte, 189 ff) maintain that the two names here are borrowed from localities and not vice versa, as Jud 7:25 implies. If so, we must take the names to be originally two places, apparently in Ephraim, for the words &quot;beyond Jordan&quot; in 7:25 contradict 8:4, where it is said that Gideon came to the Jordan and passed over. Moore (Jgs, 214) suggests that the two localities were near the junction with the Jordan of the stream that comes from Wady Far`ah. The construction of the Hebrew allows of a translation &quot;the rock (called) Oreb,&quot; and &quot;the winepress (called) Zeeb.&quot;2. The Battle of Oreb:The account of a battle here is corroborated by Isa 10:26, a verse which mentions the &quot;rock of Oreb,&quot; and suggests that the great defeat of the Midianites took place there (compare Isa 9:4). The passage in Isa 10:24-26 is prose, however, and is said to be late editing (see G.H. Box, Isa, 65). In Ps 83:11 (Hebrew 12) there is a prayer that God would make the &quot;nobles&quot; among the Psalmist&#x27;s enemies as Oreb and Zeeb.David Francis Roberts</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">or&#x27;-na-ment (`adhi, &quot;adornment&quot;): In common with all the Orientals, the Hebrews were very fond of wearing ornaments, and their tendency to extravagance of this kind often met with stern prophetic rebuke (Isa 3:16-24; Eze 13:18-20). On this subject, little is said in the New Testament apart from Jesus&#x27; (Lu 7:25; 12:23) and James&#x27; (Jas 2:2) invectives against meretricious estimates of moral character. Yet the employment of attractive attire receives sanction in the divine example of Eze 16:10-14.Ornaments in general would include finely embroidered or decorated fabrics, such as the priest&#x27;s dress or the high-priestly attire, and the richly wrought veil, girdle and turban used by the wealthier class. But the term may be limited here to the various rings, bracelets and chains made of precious metals and more or less jeweled (compare Jer 2:32).These latter, described in detail under their own titles, may be summarized here as finger-rings, particularly prized as seal-rings (Ge 38:18,25; Jer 22:24); arm-rings or bracelets (Ge 24:22; 2Sa 1:10); earrings (Ge 35:4; Ex 32:2); noserings (Ge 24:47; Eze 16:12); anklets or ankle-chains (Isa 3:16,18); head-bands or fillets or cauls (referred to in Isa 3:18 only), and necklaces or neck-chains (Ge 41:42; Eze 16:11).Figurative: The universal devotion to ornament among the Orientals is the occasion for frequent Biblical allusions to the beauty and splendor of fine jewelry and attire. But everywhere, in divine injunctions, the emphasis of value is placed upon the beauty of holiness as an inward grace rather than on the attractions of outward ornament (Job 40:10; Ps 110:3; Joe 2:13; 1Ti 2:9,10; 1Pe 3:4). In grievous sorrow, all ornament was to be laid aside in token of mourning (Ex 33:4-6).Leonard W. Doolan</p>

There is no clear case where it means the loss of both parents. The Scriptures devote considerable attention to the widow and orphan, and the idea is that the child is fatherless. It is not found in the King James Version of the New Testament; but the Greek word orphanos occurs twice, Joh 14:18 (the King James Version &quot;comfortless,&quot; the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;desolate,&quot; margin &quot;orphans&quot;) and Jas 1:27 (&quot;fatherless&quot;).See FATHERLESS.D.

The word is found in the list of abominations only. See Le 11:13; De 14:12. The osprey was quite similar in appearance to some of the smaller eagles, and by some it is thought that the short-toed eagle is intended. But the eagle and the gier-eagle had been specified, and on account of the osprey plunging into water for food and having feet bare to the lower leg-joint and plumage of brighter and more distinctive marking, it seems very probable that it was recognized as a distinctive species, and so named separately. Moreover, the osprey was not numerous as were other hawks and eagles. It was a bird that lived almost wholly on fish, and these were not plentiful in the waters of Palestine. This would tend to make it a marked bird, so no doubt the translation is correct as it stands, as any hawk that lived on fish would have been barred as an article of diet (see Tristram, Natural History of the Bible, 182; also Studers, Birds of North America, p. 16).Gene Stratton-Porter</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">os&#x27;-i-fraj (perec; gups; Let Ossifraga): The great bearded vulture known as the lammer-geier (Le 11:13; De 14:12 the King James Version, the Revised Version (British and American) &quot;gier-eagle&quot;). The Hebrew name perec means &quot;to break.&quot; Let oasis, &quot;bone,&quot; and frangere, &quot;to break,&quot; indicate the most noticeable habit of the bird. It is the largest of the vulture family, being 3 1/2 ft. in length and 10 in sweep. It has a white head, black beard on the chin, and the part of the eye commonly called the &quot;white&quot; in most animals, which is visible in but few birds, in this family is pronounced and of a deep angry red, thus giving the bird a formidable appearance. The back is grayish black, the feathers finely penciled, the shaft being white, the median line tawny. The under parts are tawny white and the feet and talons powerful. It differs from the vulture in that it is not a consistent carrion feeder, but prefers to take prey of the size captured by some of the largest eagles. It took its name from the fact that after smaller vultures and eagles had stripped a carcass to the last shred of muscle, the lammergeier then carried the skeleton aloft and dropped it repeatedly until the marrow from the broken bones could be eaten. It is also very fond of tortoise, the meat of which it secures in the same manner. As this bird frequents Southern Europe, it is thought to be the one that mistook the bald head of Aeschylus, the poet, for a stone and let fall on it the tortoise that caused his death. This bird also attacks living prey of the size of lambs, kids and hares. It is not numerous and does not flock, but pairs live in deep gorges and rocky crevices. It builds an enormous nest, deposits one pinkish or yellowish egg, and the young is black. It requires two years to develop the red eyes, finely penciled plumage and white head of the adult bird. It was included among the abominations because of its diet of carrion.Gene Stratton-Porter</p>

          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">os&#x27;-tra-ka: The word ostracon (&quot;potsherd,&quot; Hebrew cheres) occurs in Job 2:8 (Septuagint), kai elaben ostrakon, &quot;and he took him a potsherd.&quot; Earthen vessels were in universal use in antiquity (they are twice mentioned in the New Testament: skeue ostrakina (2Co 4:7; 2Ti 2:20)), and the broken fragments of them, which could be picked up almost anywhere, were made to serve various purposes. Upon the smoothest of these pieces of unglazed pottery the poorest might write in ink his memoranda, receipts, letters or texts.1. Hebrew Ostraca:A fortunate discovery at Samaria (1910), made among the ruins of Ahab&#x27;s palace, has brought to light 75 Hebrew ostraca inscribed with ink, in the Phoenician character, with accounts and memoranda relating to private matters and dating probably from the time of Ahab. Their historical contribution, aside from the mention of many names of persons and places, is slender, but for ancient Hebrew writing and to a less extent for Hebrew words and forms they are of value, while the fact that in them we possess documents actually penned in Israel in the 9th century BC gives them extraordinary interest. The nature of ostraca tends to their preservation under conditions which would quickly destroy parchment, skin or papyrus, and this discovery in Palestine encourages the hope of further and more significant finds.2. Greek Ostraca:Greek ostraca in large quantities have been found in Egypt, preserving documents of many kinds, chiefly tax receipts. The texts of some 2,000 of these have been published, principally by Wilcken (Griechische Ostraka, 2 volumes, 1899), and serve to illustrate in unexpected ways the everyday Greek speech of the common people of Egypt through the Ptolemaic, Roman and Byzantine periods. Like the papyri, they help to throw light on New Testament syntax and lexicography, as well as on ancient life in general.3. New Testament Ostraca:It is said that Cleanthes the Stoic, being too poor to buy papyrus, used to write on ostraca, but no remains of classical literature have been found on the ostraca thus far discovered. In some instances, however, Christian literary texts are preserved upon ostraca. Some years ago Bouriant bought in Upper Egypt 20 ostraca, probably of the 7th century, inscribed with the Greek text of parts of the Gospels. The ostraca are of different sizes, and preserve among others one long continuous passage (Lu 22:40-71), which runs over 10 of the pieces. The ostraca contain from 2 to 9 verses each, and cover Mt 27:31,32; Mr 5:40,41 (9:3); 9:17,18,22; 15:21; Lu 12:13-16; 22:40-71; Joh 1:1-9; 1:14-17; 18:19-25; 19:15-17. The texts are in 3 different hands, and attest the interest of the poor in the gospel in the century of the Arab conquest. Another late ostracon has a rough drawing labeled &quot;St. Peter the evangelist,&quot; perhaps in allusion to the Gospel of Peter.4. Coptic Ostraca:Coptic ostraca, too, are numerous, especially from the Byzantine period, and of even more interest for Christian history th...</p>

The Hebrew words ya`anah, which means &quot;greediness,&quot; and bath ha-ya`anah, &quot;daughter of greediness,&quot; are made to refer to the indiscriminate diet of the ostrich, to which bird they apply; and again to the owl, with no applicability. The owl at times has a struggle to swallow whole prey it has taken, but the mere fact that it is a night hunter forever shuts it from the class of greedy and promiscuous feeders. The bodies of owls are proverbially lean like eagles. Neither did the owl frequent several places where older versions of Jer and Isa place it; so the translations are now correctly rendered &quot;ostrich.&quot; These birds came into the Bible because of their desert life, the companions they lived among there, and because of their night cries that were guttural, terrifying groans, like the roaring of lions. The birds were brought into many pictures of desolation, because people dreaded their fearful voices. They horned on the trackless deserts that were dreaded by travelers, and when they came feeding on the fringe of the wilderness, they fell into company with vulture, eagle, lion, jackal and adder, and joined their voices with the night hawks and owls. For these reasons no birds were more suitable for drawing strong comparisons from.1. Physical Peculiarities:They attained a height ranging from 6 to 8 ft., and weighed from 200 to 300 lbs. The head was small with large eyes having powerful vision, and protected by lashes. The neck was long, covered with down, and the windpipe showed, while large bites could be seen to slide down the gullet. The legs were bare, long, and the muscles like steel from the long distances covered in desert travel. The foot was much like the cloven hoof of a beast. The inner toe was 7 inches long, with a clawlike hoof, the outer, smaller with no claw. With its length and strength of leg and the weight of foot it could strike a blow that saved it from attack by beasts smaller than a leopard. The wings were small, the muscles soft and flabby. They would not bear the weight of the bird, but the habit of lifting and beating them proved that this assisted in attaining speed in running (compare Xen. Anab. i.5,2, 3). The body was covered with soft flexible feathers, the wings and tail growing long plumes, for which the bird has been pursued since the beginning of time. These exquisite feathers were first used to decorate the headdress and shields of desert chieftains, then as decorations for royalty, and later for hat and hair ornaments. The badge of the Prince of Wales is three white ostrich plumes. The females are smaller, the colors gray and white, the males a glossy black, the wing and tail plumes white. The ostrich has three physical peculiarities that stagger scientists. It has eyelashes, developed no doubt to protect the eyes from the dust and sand of desert life. On the wings are two plumeless shafts like large porcupine quills. These may be ...</p>

He later smote Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, whom the children of Israel had served 8 years, and thus not only saved the Israelites, but by reviving national sentiment among them (compare Ant, V, iv, 3), and reestablishing government, became the first of those hero-rulers known as &quot;judges.&quot; The effects of his victory lasted an entire generation (40 years, Jud 3:9-11). He had a son named Hathath (1Ch 4:13) and probably another named Meonothai (compare recensio Luciana of Septuagint, at the place).

In Exodus, where it occurs 8 times, it is clear that the gold settings of the engraved stones forming the breast-plate of the high priest are intended; the onyx stones forming the fibula or brooch for holding together the two sides of the breast-plate being said to be &quot;enclosed in ouches (settings) of gold&quot; (Ex 39:6). Not only were these two onyx or beryl stones so set, but the 12 stones forming the front of the breast-plate were &quot;inclosed in gold in their settings&quot; (Ex 28:20). The same word occurs in Ps 45:13, where the king&#x27;s daughter is said to have her clothing &quot;in-wrought with gold,&quot; i.e. embroidered with gold thread or wire. Ex 39:3 tells us how this wire was produced. From this fact it may be inferred that the settings of the breast-plate were not solid pieces of gold, but were formed of woven wire wreathed round the stones, in a sort of filigree.See also STONES, PRECIOUS.W.

          <h3 style="font-family:var(--font-heading);color:var(--leather-dark);margin:0 0 0.5rem;">OWL</h3>
          <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;">oul (bath ha-ya`anah; Latin Ulula): The name of every nocturnal bird of prey of the Natural Order Striges. These birds range from the great horned owl of 2 feet in length, through many subdivisions to the little screech-owl of 5 inches. All are characterized by very large heads, many have ear tufts, all have large eyes surrounded by a disk of tiny, stiff, radiating feathers. The remainder of the plumage has no aftershaft. So these birds make the softest flight of any creature traveling on wing. A volume could be written on the eye of the owl, perhaps its most wonderful feature being in the power of the bird to enlarge the iris if it wishes more distinct vision. There is material for another on the prominent and peculiar auditory parts. With almost all owls the feet are so arranged that two toes can be turned forward and two back, thus reinforcing the grip of the bird by an extra toe and giving it unusual strength of foot. All are night-hunters, taking prey to be found at that time, of size according to the strength. The owl was very numerous in the caves, ruined temples and cities, and even in the fertile valleys of Palestine. It is given place in the Bible because it was considered unfit for food and because people dreaded the cries of every branch of the numerous family. It appeared often, as most birds, in the early versions of the Bible; later translators seem to feel that it was used in several places where the ostrich really was intended (see OSTRICH). It would appear to a natural historian that the right bird could be selected by the location, where the text is confusing. The ostrich had a voice that was even more terrifying, when raised in the night, than that of the owl. But it was a bird of the desert, of wide range and traveled only by day. This would confine its habitat to the desert and the greenery where it joined fertile land, but would not bring it in very close touch with civilization. The owl is a bird of ruins, that lay mostly in the heart of rich farming lands, where prosperous cities had been built and then destroyed by enemies. Near these locations the ostrich would be pursued for its plumage, and its nesting conditions did not prevail. The location was strictly the owl&#x27;s chosen haunt, and it had the voice to fit all the requirements of the text. In the lists of abominations, the original Hebrew yanshuph, derived from a root meaning twilight, is translated &quot;great owl&quot; (see Le 11:17 and De 14:16). It is probable that this was a bird about 2 ft. in length, called the eagle-owl. In the same lists the word koc (nuktikorax) refers to ruins, and the bird indicated is specified as the &quot;little owl,&quot; that is, smaller than the great owl--about the size of our barn owl. This bird is referred to as the &quot;mother of ruins,&quot; and the translations that place it in deserted temples and cities are beyond all doubt correct. Qippoz (echinos) occurs once (Isa 34:15), and is translated &quot;great owl&quot; in former versions; lately (in the American Standar...</p>

The great owl mentioned in the Bible was no doubt their largest specimen of the family, a bird fully 2 ft. in length, full feathered, with unusually large head and long ear tufts. It was a formidable and noble-appearing bird, with resounding voice. It was abundant among the ruins of temples, the tombs of Carmel, the caves of Gennesaret, and among the ruined cities of Southern Judah. It is included in the abomination lists of Le 11:17 and De 14:16.See OWL.Gene Stratton-Porter</p>
