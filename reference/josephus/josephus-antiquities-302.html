        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 1. How Esau And Jacob, Isaac&#x27;s Sons Divided Their Habitation;
And Esau Possessed Idumea And Jacob Canaan.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. After the death of Isaac, his sons divided their habitations
respectively; nor did they retain what they had before; but Esau
departed from the city of Hebron, and left it to his brother, and dwelt
in Seir, and ruled over Idumea. He called the country by that name from
himself, for he was named Adom; which appellation he got on the
following occasion:—One day returning from the toil of hunting very
hungry, [it was when he was a child in age,] he lighted on his brother
when he was getting ready lentile-pottage for his dinner, which was of a
very red color; on which account he the more earnestly longed for it,
and desired him to give him some of it to eat: but he made advantage of
his brother&#x27;s hunger, and forced him to resign up to him his birthright;
and he, being pinched with famine, resigned it up to him, under an oath.
Whence it came, that, on account of the redness of this pottage, he was,
in way of jest, by his contemporaries, called Adom, for the Hebrews call
what is red Adom; and this was the name given to the country; but the
Greeks gave it a more agreeable pronunciation, and named it Idumea.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. He became the father of five sons; of whom Jaus, and Jalomus, and
Coreus, were by one wife, whose name was Alibama; but of the rest,
Aliphaz was born to him by Ada, and Raguel by Basemmath: and these were
the sons of Esau. Aliphaz had five legitimate sons; Theman, Omer,
Saphus, Gotham, and Kanaz; for Amalek was not legitimate, but by a
concubine, whose name was Thamna. These dwelt in that part of Idumea
which is called Gebalitis, and that denominated from Amalek, Amalekitis;
for Idumea was a large country, and did then preserve the name of the
whole, while in its several parts it kept the names of its peculiar
inhabitants.</p>
