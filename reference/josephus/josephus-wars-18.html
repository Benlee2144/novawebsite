        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">Concerning The Sabbatic River Which Titus Saw As He Was
     Journeying Through Syria; And How The People Of Antioch Came
     With A Petition To Titus Against The Jews But Were Rejected
     By Him; As Also Concerning Titus&#x27;s And Vespasian&#x27;s Triumph.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now Titus Caesar tarried some time at Berytus, as we told you before.
He thence removed, and exhibited magnificent shows in all those cities
of Syria through which he went, and made use of the captive Jews as
public instances of the destruction of that nation. He then saw a
river as he went along, of such a nature as deserves to be recorded in
history; it runs in the middle between Arcea, belonging to Agrippa&#x27;s
kingdom, and Raphanea. It hath somewhat very peculiar in it; for when
it runs, its current is strong, and has plenty of water; after which its
springs fail for six days together, and leave its channel dry, as any
one may see; after which days it runs on the seventh day as it did
before, and as though it had undergone no change at all; it hath also
been observed to keep this order perpetually and exactly; whence it is
that they call it the Sabbatic River 7 that name being taken from the
sacred seventh day among the Jews.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. But when the people of Antioch were informed that Titus was
approaching, they were so glad at it, that they could not keep within
their walls, but hasted away to give him the meeting; nay, they
proceeded as far as thirty furlongs, and more, with that intention.
These were not the men only, but a multitude of women also with their
children did the same; and when they saw him coming up to them, they
stood on both sides of the way, and stretched out their right hands,
saluting him, and making all sorts of acclamations to him, and turned
back together with him. They also, among all the acclamations they made
to him, besought him all the way they went to eject the Jews out of
their city; yet did not Titus at all yield to this their petition, but
gave them the bare hearing of it quietly. However, the Jews were in a
great deal of terrible fear, under the uncertainty they were in what
his opinion was, and what he would do to them. For Titus did not stay
at Antioch, but continued his progress immediately to Zeugma, which lies
upon the Euphrates, whither came to him messengers from Vologeses king
of Parthia, and brought him a crown of gold upon the victory he had
gained over the Jews; which he accepted of, and feasted the king&#x27;s
messengers, and then came back to Antioch. And when the senate and
people of Antioch earnestly entreated him to come upon their theater,
where their whole multitude was assembled, and expected him, he complied
with great humanity; but when they pressed him with much earnestness,
and continually begged of him that he would eject the Jews out of their
city, he gave them this very pertinent answer: &quot;How can this be done,
since that country of theirs, whither the Jews must be obliged then to
retire, is destroyed, and no place will receive them besides?&quot; Whereupon
the people of Antioch, when they had failed of success in this their
first request, made him a second; for they desired that he would order
those tables of brass to be removed on which the Jews&#x27; privileges were
engraven. However, Titus would not grant that neither, but permitted the
Jews of Antioch to continue to enjoy the very same privileges in that
city which they had before, and then departed for Egypt; and as he came
to Jerusalem in his progress, and compared the melancholy condition he
saw it then in, with the ancient glory of the city, and called to mind
the greatness of its present ruins, as well as its ancient splendor,
he could not but pity the destruction of the city, so far was he from
boasting that so great and goodly a city as that was had been by him
taken by force; nay, he frequently cursed those that had been the
authors of their revolt, and had brought such a punishment upon the
city; insomuch that it openly appeared that he did not desire that
such a calamity as this punishment of theirs amounted to should be a
demonstration of his courage. Yet was there no small quantity of the
riches that had been in that city still found among its ruins, a great
deal of which the Romans dug up; but the greatest part was discovered
by those who were captives, and so they carried it away; I mean the gold
and the silver, and the rest of that most precious furniture which the
Jews had, and which the owners had treasured up under ground, against
the uncertain fortunes of war.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. So Titus took the journey he intended into Egypt, and passed over the
desert very suddenly, and came to Alexandria, and took up a resolution
to go to Rome by sea. And as he was accompanied by two legions, he sent
each of them again to the places whence they had before come; the fifth
he sent to Mysia, and the fifteenth to Pannonia: as for the leaders of
the captives, Simon and John, with the other seven hundred men, whom
he had selected out of the rest as being eminently tall and handsome
of body, he gave order that they should be soon carried to Italy,
as resolving to produce them in his triumph. So when he had had a
prosperous voyage to his mind, the city of Rome behaved itself in his
reception, and their meeting him at a distance, as it did in the case
of his father. But what made the most splendid appearance in Titus&#x27;s
opinion was, when his father met him, and received him; but still the
multitude of the citizens conceived the greatest joy when they saw
them all three together, 8 as they did at this time; nor were many days
overpast when they determined to have but one triumph, that should be
common to both of them, on account of the glorious exploits they had
performed, although the senate had decreed each of them a separate
triumph by himself. So when notice had been given beforehand of the day
appointed for this pompous solemnity to be made, on account of their
victories, not one of the immense multitude was left in the city, but
every body went out so far as to gain only a station where they might
stand, and left only such a passage as was necessary for those that were
to be seen to go along it.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. Now all the soldiery marched out beforehand by companies, and in
their several ranks, under their several commanders, in the night time,
and were about the gates, not of the upper palaces, but those near
the temple of Isis; for there it was that the emperors had rested the
foregoing night. And as soon as ever it was day, Vespasian and Titus
came out crowned with laurel, and clothed in those ancient purple habits
which were proper to their family, and then went as far as Octavian&#x27;s
Walks; for there it was that the senate, and the principal rulers, and
those that had been recorded as of the equestrian order, waited for
them. Now a tribunal had been erected before the cloisters, and ivory
chairs had been set upon it, when they came and sat down upon them.
Whereupon the soldiery made an acclamation of joy to them immediately,
and all gave them attestations of their valor; while they were
themselves without their arms, and only in their silken garments, and
crowned with laurel: then Vespasian accepted of these shouts of theirs;
but while they were still disposed to go on in such acclamations, he
gave them a signal of silence. And when every body entirely held their
peace, he stood up, and covering the greatest part of his head with his
cloak, he put up the accustomed solemn prayers; the like prayers did
Titus put up also; after which prayers Vespasian made a short speech to
all the people, and then sent away the soldiers to a dinner prepared for
them by the emperors. Then did he retire to that gate which was called
the Gate of the Pomp, because pompous shows do always go through that
gate; there it was that they tasted some food, and when they had put on
their triumphal garments, and had offered sacrifices to the gods that
were placed at the gate, they sent the triumph forward, and marched
through the theatres, that they might be the more easily seen by the
multitudes.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">5. Now it is impossible to describe the multitude of the shows as they
deserve, and the magnificence of them all; such indeed as a man could
not easily think of as performed, either by the labor of workmen, or
the variety of riches, or the rarities of nature; for almost all such
curiosities as the most happy men ever get by piece-meal were here one
heaped on another, and those both admirable and costly in their nature;
and all brought together on that day demonstrated the vastness of the
dominions of the Romans; for there was here to be seen a mighty quantity
of silver, and gold, and ivory, contrived into all sorts of things, and
did not appear as carried along in pompous show only, but, as a man may
say, running along like a river. Some parts were composed of the rarest
purple hangings, and so carried along; and others accurately represented
to the life what was embroidered by the arts of the Babylonians. There
were also precious stones that were transparent, some set in crowns of
gold, and some in other places, as the workmen pleased; and of these
such a vast number were brought, that we could not but thence learn how
vainly we imagined any of them to be rarities. The images of the gods
were also carried, being as well wonderful for their largeness, as made
very artificially, and with great skill of the workmen; nor were any of
these images of any other than very costly materials; and many species
of animals were brought, every one in their own natural ornaments. The
men also who brought every one of these shows were great multitudes, and
adorned with purple garments, all over interwoven with gold; those that
were chosen for carrying these pompous shows having also about them such
magnificent ornaments as were both extraordinary and surprising. Besides
these, one might see that even the great number of the captives was not
unadorned, while the variety that was in their garments, and their fine
texture, concealed from the sight the deformity of their bodies. But
what afforded the greatest surprise of all was the structure of the
pageants that were borne along; for indeed he that met them could
not but be afraid that the bearers would not be able firmly enough to
support them, such was their magnitude; for many of them were so made,
that they were on three or even four stories, one above another. The
magnificence also of their structure afforded one both pleasure and
surprise; for upon many of them were laid carpets of gold. There
was also wrought gold and ivory fastened about them all; and many
resemblances of the war, and those in several ways, and variety of
contrivances, affording a most lively portraiture of itself. For there
was to be seen a happy country laid waste, and entire squadrons of
enemies slain; while some of them ran away, and some were carried into
captivity; with walls of great altitude and magnitude overthrown and
ruined by machines; with the strongest fortifications taken, and the
walls of most populous cities upon the tops of hills seized on, and
an army pouring itself within the walls; as also every place full of
slaughter, and supplications of the enemies, when they were no longer
able to lift up their hands in way of opposition. Fire also sent upon
temples was here represented, and houses overthrown, and falling upon
their owners: rivers also, after they came out of a large and melancholy
desert, ran down, not into a land cultivated, nor as drink for men, or
for cattle, but through a land still on fire upon every side; for the
Jews related that such a thing they had undergone during this war. Now
the workmanship of these representations was so magnificent and lively
in the construction of the things, that it exhibited what had been done
to such as did not see it, as if they had been there really present. On
the top of every one of these pageants was placed the commander of the
city that was taken, and the manner wherein he was taken. Moreover,
there followed those pageants a great number of ships; and for the other
spoils, they were carried in great plenty. But for those that were taken
in the temple of Jerusalem, 9 they made the greatest figure of them
all; that is, the golden table, of the weight of many talents; the
candlestick also, that was made of gold, though its construction were
now changed from that which we made use of; for its middle shaft was
fixed upon a basis, and the small branches were produced out of it to
a great length, having the likeness of a trident in their position, and
had every one a socket made of brass for a lamp at the tops of them.
These lamps were in number seven, and represented the dignity of the
number seven among the Jews; and the last of all the spoils, was carried
the Law of the Jews. After these spoils passed by a great many men,
carrying the images of Victory, whose structure was entirely either of
ivory or of gold. After which Vespasian marched in the first place,
and Titus followed him; Domitian also rode along with them, and made a
glorious appearance, and rode on a horse that was worthy of admiration.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">6. Now the last part of this pompous show was at the temple of Jupiter
Capitolinus, whither when they were come, they stood still; for it was
the Romans&#x27; ancient custom to stay till somebody brought the news that
the general of the enemy was slain. This general was Simon, the son of
Gioras, who had then been led in this triumph among the captives; a rope
had also been put upon his head, and he had been drawn into a proper
place in the forum, and had withal been tormented by those that drew him
along; and the law of the Romans required that malefactors condemned to
die should be slain there. Accordingly, when it was related that there
was an end of him, and all the people had set up a shout for joy, they
then began to offer those sacrifices which they had consecrated, in the
prayers used in such solemnities; which when they had finished, they
went away to the palace. And as for some of the spectators, the emperors
entertained them at their own feast; and for all the rest there were
noble preparations made for feasting at home; for this was a festival
day to the city of Rome, as celebrated for the victory obtained by their
army over their enemies, for the end that was now put to their civil
miseries, and for the commencement of their hopes of future prosperity
and happiness.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">7. After these triumphs were over, and after the affairs of the Romans
were settled on the surest foundations, Vespasian resolved to build
a temple to Peace, which was finished in so short a time, and in so
glorious a manner, as was beyond all human expectation and opinion: for
he having now by Providence a vast quantity of wealth, besides what he
had formerly gained in his other exploits, he had this temple adorned
with pictures and statues; for in this temple were collected and
deposited all such rarities as men aforetime used to wander all over the
habitable world to see, when they had a desire to see one of them after
another; he also laid up therein those golden vessels and instruments
that were taken out of the Jewish temple, as ensigns of his glory. But
still he gave order that they should lay up their Law, and the purple
veils of the holy place, in the royal palace itself, and keep them
there.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 6.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">Concerning Machaerus, And How Lucilius Bassus Took That
     Citadel, And Other Places.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now Lucilius Bassus was sent as legate into Judea, and there he
received the army from Cerealis Vitellianus, and took that citadel which
was in Herodium, together with the garrison that was in it; after which
he got together all the soldiery that was there, [which was a large
body, but dispersed into several parties,] with the tenth legion, and
resolved to make war upon Machaerus; for it was highly necessary that
this citadel should be demolished, lest it might be a means of drawing
away many into a rebellion, by reason of its strength; for the nature
of the place was very capable of affording the surest hopes of safety to
those that possessed it, as well as delay and fear to those that should
attack it; for what was walled in was itself a very rocky hill, elevated
to a very great height; which circumstance alone made it very hard to be
subdued. It was also so contrived by nature, that it could not be easily
ascended; for it is, as it were, ditched about with such valleys on all
sides, and to such a depth, that the eye cannot reach their bottoms,
and such as are not easily to be passed over, and even such as it is
impossible to fill up with earth. For that valley which cuts it on the
west extends to threescore furlongs, and did not end till it came to the
lake Asphaltites; on the same side it was also that Machaerus had
the tallest top of its hill elevated above the rest. But then for the
valleys that lay on the north and south sides, although they be not
so large as that already described, yet it is in like manner an
impracticable thing to think of getting over them; and for the valley
that lies on the east side, its depth is found to be no less than a
hundred cubits. It extends as far as a mountain that lies over against
Machaerus, with which it is bounded.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. Now when Alexander [Janneus], the king of the Jews, observed the
nature of this place, he was the first who built a citadel here,
which afterwards was demolished by Gabinius, when he made war against
Aristobulus. But when Herod came to be king, he thought the place to
be worthy of the utmost regard, and of being built upon in the firmest
manner, and this especially because it lay so near to Arabia; for it is
seated in a convenient place on that account, and hath a prospect toward
that country; he therefore surrounded a large space of ground with walls
and towers, and built a city there, out of which city there was a way
that led up to the very citadel itself on the top of the mountain; nay,
more than this, he built a wall round that top of the hill, and erected
towers at the corners, of a hundred and sixty cubits high; in the middle
of which place he built a palace, after a magnificent manner, wherein
were large and beautiful edifices. He also made a great many reservoirs
for the reception of water, that there might be plenty of it ready
for all uses, and those in the properest places that were afforded him
there. Thus did he, as it were, contend with the nature of the place,
that he might exceed its natural strength and security [which yet itself
rendered it hard to be taken] by those fortifications which were made by
the hands of men. Moreover, he put a large quantity of darts and other
machines of war into it, and contrived to get every thing thither that
might any way contribute to its inhabitants&#x27; security, under the longest
siege possible.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. Now within this place there grew a sort of rue 10 that deserves our
wonder on account of its largeness, for it was no way inferior to any
fig tree whatsoever, either in height or in thickness; and the report
is, that it had lasted ever since the times of Herod, and would probably
have lasted much longer, had it not been cut down by those Jews who
took possession of the place afterward. But still in that valley which
encompasses the city on the north side there is a certain place called
Baaras, which produces a root of the same name with itself 11 its
color is like to that of flame, and towards the evenings it sends out a
certain ray like lightning. It is not easily taken by such as would
do it, but recedes from their hands, nor will yield itself to be taken
quietly, until either the urine of a woman, or her menstrual blood, be
poured upon it; nay, even then it is certain death to those that touch
it, unless any one take and hang the root itself down from his hand,
and so carry it away. It may also be taken another way, without danger,
which is this: they dig a trench quite round about it, till the hidden
part of the root be very small, they then tie a dog to it, and when the
dog tries hard to follow him that tied him, this root is easily plucked
up, but the dog dies immediately, as if it were instead of the man that
would take the plant away; nor after this need any one be afraid of
taking it into their hands. Yet, after all this pains in getting, it
is only valuable on account of one virtue it hath, that if it be only
brought to sick persons, it quickly drives away those called demons,
which are no other than the spirits of the wicked, that enter into men
that are alive and kill them, unless they can obtain some help against
them. Here are also fountains of hot water, that flow out of this place,
which have a very different taste one from the other; for some of them
are bitter, and others of them are plainly sweet. Here are also many
eruptions of cold waters, and this not only in the places that lie
lower, and have their fountains near one another, but, what is still
more wonderful, here is to be seen a certain cave hard by, whose cavity
is not deep, but it is covered over by a rock that is prominent; above
this rock there stand up two [hills or] breasts, as it were, but a
little distant one from another, the one of which sends out a fountain
that is very cold, and the other sends out one that is very hot; which
waters, when they are mingled together, compose a most pleasant bath;
they are medicinal indeed for other maladies, but especially good for
strengthening the nerves. This place has in it also mines of sulfur and
alum.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. Now when Bassus had taken a full view of this place, he resolved to
besiege it, by filling up the valley that lay on the east side; so he
fell hard to work, and took great pains to raise his banks as soon as
possible, and by that means to render the siege easy. As for the Jews
that were caught in this place, they separated themselves from the
strangers that were with them, and they forced those strangers, as an
otherwise useless multitude, to stay in the lower part of the city, and
undergo the principal dangers, while they themselves seized on the upper
citadel, and held it, and this both on account of its strength, and to
provide for their own safety. They also supposed they might obtain their
pardon, in case they should [at last] surrender the citadel. However,
they were willing to make trial, in the first place, whether the
hopes they had of avoiding a siege would come to any thing; with which
intention they made sallies every day, and fought with those that met
them; in which conflicts they were many of them slain, as they therein
slew many of the Romans. But still it was the opportunities that
presented themselves which chiefly gained both sides their victories;
these were gained by the Jews, when they fell upon the Romans as they
were off their guard; but by the Romans, when, upon the others&#x27; sallies
against their banks, they foresaw their coming, and were upon their
guard when they received them. But the conclusion of this siege did
not depend upon these bickerings; but a certain surprising accident,
relating to what was done in this siege, forced the Jews to surrender
the citadel. There was a certain young man among the besieged, of great
boldness, and very active of his hand, his name was Eleazar; he greatly
signalized himself in those sallies, and encouraged the Jews to go out
in great numbers, in order to hinder the raising of the banks, and did
the Romans a vast deal of mischief when they came to fighting; he so
managed matters, that those who sallied out made their attacks easily,
and returned back without danger, and this by still bringing up the rear
himself. Now it happened that, on a certain time, when the fight was
over, and both sides were parted, and retired home, he, in way of
contempt of the enemy, and thinking that none of them would begin the
fight again at that time, staid without the gates, and talked with those
that were upon the wall, and his mind was wholly intent upon what they
said. Now a certain person belonging to the Roman camp, whose name was
Rufus, by birth an Egyptian, ran upon him suddenly, when nobody expected
such a thing, and carried him off, with his armor itself; while, in the
mean time, those that saw it from the wall were under such an amazement,
that Rufus prevented their assistance, and carried Eleazar to the Roman
camp. So the general of the Romans ordered that he should be taken up
naked, set before the city to be seen, and sorely whipped before their
eyes. Upon this sad accident that befell the young man, the Jews were
terribly confounded, and the city, with one voice, sorely lamented him,
and the mourning proved greater than could well be supposed upon the
calamity of a single person. When Bassus perceived that, he began
to think of using a stratagem against the enemy, and was desirous to
aggravate their grief, in order to prevail with them to surrender the
city for the preservation of that man. Nor did he fail of his hope; for
he commanded them to set up a cross, as if he were just going to hang
Eleazar upon it immediately; the sight of this occasioned a sore grief
among those that were in the citadel, and they groaned vehemently, and
cried out that they could not bear to see him thus destroyed. Whereupon
Eleazar besought them not to disregard him, now he was going to suffer a
most miserable death, and exhorted them to save themselves, by yielding
to the Roman power and good fortune, since all other people were now
conquered by them. These men were greatly moved with what he said, there
being also many within the city that interceded for him, because he was
of an eminent and very numerous family; so they now yielded to their
passion of commiseration, contrary to their usual custom. Accordingly,
they sent out immediately certain messengers, and treated with the
Romans, in order to a surrender of the citadel to them, and desired that
they might be permitted to go away, and take Eleazar along with them.
Then did the Romans and their general accept of these terms; while the
multitude of strangers that were in the lower part of the city, hearing
of the agreement that was made by the Jews for themselves alone, were
resolved to fly away privately in the night time; but as soon as they
had opened their gates, those that had come to terms with Bassus told
him of it; whether it were that they envied the others&#x27; deliverance,
or whether it were done out of fear, lest an occasion should be taken
against them upon their escape, is uncertain. The most courageous,
therefore, of those men that went out prevented the enemy, and got away,
and fled for it; but for those men that were caught within they were
slain to the number of one thousand seven hundred, as were the women and
children made slaves. But as Bassus thought he must perform the covenant
he had made with those that surrendered the citadel, he let them go, and
restored Eleazar to them.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">5. When Bassus had settled these affairs, he marched hastily to the
forest of Jarden, as it is called; for he had heard that a great many
of those that had fled from Jerusalem and Machaerus formerly were there
gotten together. When he was therefore come to the place, and understood
that the former news was no mistake, he, in the first place, surrounded
the whole place with his horsemen, that such of the Jews as had boldness
enough to try to break through might have no way possible for escaping,
by reason of the situation of these horsemen; and for the footmen, he
ordered them to cut down the trees that were in the wood whither
they were fled. So the Jews were under a necessity of performing some
glorious exploit, and of greatly exposing themselves in a battle, since
they might perhaps thereby escape. So they made a general attack, and
with a great shout fell upon those that surrounded them, who received
them with great courage; and so while the one side fought desperately,
and the others would not yield, the fight was prolonged on that account.
But the event of the battle did not answer the expectation of the
assailants; for so it happened, that no more than twelve fell on the
Roman side, with a few that were wounded; but not one of the Jews
escaped out of this battle, but they were all killed, being in the whole
not fewer in number than three thousand, together with Judas, the son
of Jairus, their general, concerning whom we have before spoken, that he
had been a captain of a certain band at the siege of Jerusalem, and by
going down into a certain vault under ground, had privately made his
escape.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">6. About the same time it was that Caesar sent a letter to Bassus, and
to Liberius Maximus, who was the procurator [of Judea], and gave order
that all Judea should be exposed to sale 12 for he did not found any
city there, but reserved the country for himself. However, he assigned
a place for eight hundred men only, whom he had dismissed from his army,
which he gave them for their habitation; it is called Emmaus, 13 and is
distant from Jerusalem threescore furlongs. He also laid a tribute upon
the Jews wheresoever they were, and enjoined every one of them to bring
two drachmae every year into the Capitol, as they used to pay the same
to the temple at Jerusalem. And this was the state of the Jewish affairs
at this time.</p>

        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">Concerning The Calamity That Befell Antiochus, King Of
     Commagene. As Also Concerning The Alans And What Great
     Mischiefs They Did To The Medes And Armenians.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. And now, in the fourth year of the reign of Vespasian, it came to
pass that Antiochus, the king of Commagene, with all his family, fell
into very great calamities. The occasion was this: Cesennius Petus, who
was president of Syria at this time, whether it were done out of regard
to truth, or whether out of hatred to Antiochus, [for which was the real
motive was never thoroughly discovered,] sent an epistle to Caesar, and
therein told him that Antiochus, with his son Epiphanes, had resolved to
rebel against the Romans, and had made a league with the king of Parthia
to that purpose; that it was therefore fit to prevent them, lest they
prevent us, and begin such a war as may cause a general disturbance in
the Roman empire. Now Caesar was disposed to take some care about the
matter, since this discovery was made; for the neighborhood of the
kingdoms made this affair worthy of greater regard; for Samoseta, the
capital of Commagene, lies upon Euphrates, and upon any such design
could afford an easy passage over it to the Parthians, and could also
afford them a secure reception. Petus was accordingly believed, and had
authority given him of doing what he should think proper in the case; so
he set about it without delay, and fell upon Commagene before Antiochus
and his people had the least expectation of his coming: he had with him
the tenth legion, as also some cohorts and troops of horsemen. These
kings also came to his assistance: Aristobulus, king of the country
called Chalcidene, and Sohemus, who was called king of Emesa. Nor was
there any opposition made to his forces when they entered the kingdom;
for no one of that country would so much as lift up his hand against
them. When Antiochus heard this unexpected news, he could not think in
the least of making war with the Romans, but determined to leave his
whole kingdom in the state wherein it now was, and to retire privately,
with his wife and children, as thinking thereby to demonstrate himself
to the Romans to be innocent as to the accusation laid against him. So
he went away from that city as far as a hundred and twenty furlongs,
into a plain, and there pitched his tents.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. Petus then sent some of his men to seize upon Samosate, and by their
means took possession of that city, while he went himself to attack
Antiochus with the rest of his army. However, the king was not prevailed
upon by the distress he was in to do any thing in the way of war against
the Romans, but bemoaned his own hard fate, and endured with patience
what he was not able to prevent. But his sons, who were young, and
unexperienced in war, but of strong bodies, were not easily induced
to bear this calamity without fighting. Epiphanes, therefore, and
Callinicus, betook themselves to military force; and as the battle was a
sore one, and lasted all the day long, they showed their own valor in
a remarkable manner, and nothing but the approach of night put a period
thereto, and that without any diminution of their forces; yet would
not Antiochus, upon this conclusion of the fight, continue there by any
means, but took his wife and his daughters, and fled away with them
to Cilicia, and by so doing quite discouraged the minds of his own
soldiers. Accordingly, they revolted, and went over to the Romans, out
of the despair they were in of his keeping the kingdom; and his case was
looked upon by all as quite desperate. It was therefore necessary that
Epiphanes and his soldiers should get clear of their enemies before they
became entirely destitute of any confederates; nor were there any more
than ten horsemen with him, who passed with him over Euphrates, whence
they went undisturbed to Vologeses, the king of Parthia, where they were
not disregarded as fugitives, but had the same respect paid them as if
they had retained their ancient prosperity.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. Now when Antiochus was come to Tarsus in Cilicia, Petus ordered
a centurion to go to him, and send him in bonds to Rome. However,
Vespasian could not endure to have a king brought to him in that manner,
but thought it fit rather to have a regard to the ancient friendship
that had been between them, than to preserve an inexorable anger upon
pretense of this war. Accordingly, he gave orders that they should take
off his bonds, while he was still upon the road, and that he should not
come to Rome, but should now go and live at Lacedemon; he also gave him
large revenues, that he might not only live in plenty, but like a king
also. When Epiphanes, who before was in great fear for his father, was
informed of this, their minds were freed from that great and almost
incurable concern they had been under. He also hoped that Caesar would
be reconciled to them, upon the intercession of Vologeses; for although
he lived in plenty, he knew not how to bear living out of the Roman
empire. So Caesar gave him leave, after an obliging manner, and he came
to Rome; and as his father came quickly to him from Lacedemon, he had
all sorts of respect paid him there, and there he remained.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. Now there was a nation of the Alans, which we have formerly mentioned
some where as being Scythians and inhabiting at the lake Meotis. This
nation about this time laid a design of falling upon Media, and the
parts beyond it, in order to plunder them; with which intention they
treated with the king of Hyrcania; for he was master of that passage
which king Alexander [the Great] shut up with iron gates. This king gave
them leave to come through them; so they came in great multitudes, and
fell upon the Medes unexpectedly, and plundered their country, which
they found full of people, and replenished with abundance of cattle,
while nobody durst make any resistance against them; for Paeorus, the
king of the country, had fled away for fear into places where they could
not easily come at him, and had yielded up every thing he had to them,
and had only saved his wife and his concubines from them, and that with
difficulty also, after they had been made captives, by giving them a
hundred talents for their ransom. These Alans therefore plundered the
country without opposition, and with great ease, and proceeded as far
as Armenia, laying all waste before them. Now Tiridates was king of that
country, who met them, and fought them, but had like to have been taken
alive in the battle; for a certain man threw a net over him from a great
distance, and had soon drawn him to him, unless he had immediately cut
the cord with his sword, and ran away, and prevented it. So the Alans,
being still more provoked by this sight, laid waste the country, and
drove a great multitude of the men, and a great quantity of the other
prey they had gotten out of both kingdoms, along with them, and then
retreated back to their own country.</p>

        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">Concerning Masada And Those Sicarii Who Kept It; And How
     Silva Betook Himself To Form The Siege Of That Citadel.
     Eleazar&#x27;s Speeches To The Besieged.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. When Bassus was dead in Judea, Flavius Silva succeeded him as
procurator there; who, when he saw that all the rest of the country was
subdued in this war, and that there was but one only strong hold
that was still in rebellion, he got all his army together that lay in
different places, and made an expedition against it. This fortress was
called Masada. It was one Eleazar, a potent man, and the commander of
these Sicarii, that had seized upon it. He was a descendant from that
Judas who had persuaded abundance of the Jews, as we have formerly
related, not to submit to the taxation when Cyrenius was sent into Judea
to make one; for then it was that the Sicarii got together against
those that were willing to submit to the Romans, and treated them in all
respects as if they had been their enemies, both by plundering them
of what they had, by driving away their cattle, and by setting fire
to their houses; for they said that they differed not at all from
foreigners, by betraying, in so cowardly a manner, that freedom which
Jews thought worthy to be contended for to the utmost, and by owning
that they preferred slavery under the Romans before such a contention.
Now this was in reality no better than a pretense and a cloak for the
barbarity which was made use of by them, and to color over their own
avarice, which they afterwards made evident by their own actions; for
those that were partners with them in their rebellion joined also with
them in the war against the Romans, and went further lengths with them
in their impudent undertakings against them; and when they were again
convicted of dissembling in such their pretenses, they still more abused
those that justly reproached them for their wickedness. And indeed that
was a time most fertile in all manner of wicked practices, insomuch that
no kind of evil deeds were then left undone; nor could any one so much
as devise any bad thing that was new, so deeply were they all infected,
and strove with one another in their single capacity, and in their
communities, who should run the greatest lengths in impiety towards
God, and in unjust actions towards their neighbors; the men of power
oppressing the multitude, and the multitude earnestly laboring to
destroy the men of power. The one part were desirous of tyrannizing over
others, and the rest of offering violence to others, and of plundering
such as were richer than themselves. They were the Sicarii who first
began these transgressions, and first became barbarous towards those
allied to them, and left no words of reproach unsaid, and no works of
perdition untried, in order to destroy those whom their contrivances
affected. Yet did John demonstrate by his actions that these Sicarii
were more moderate than he was himself, for he not only slew all such
as gave him good counsel to do what was right, but treated them worst of
all, as the most bitter enemies that he had among all the Citizens; nay,
he filled his entire country with ten thousand instances of wickedness,
such as a man who was already hardened sufficiently in his impiety
towards God would naturally do; for the food was unlawful that was set
upon his table, and he rejected those purifications that the law of his
country had ordained; so that it was no longer a wonder if he, who
was so mad in his impiety towards God, did not observe any rules of
gentleness and common affection towards men. Again, therefore, what
mischief was there which Simon the son of Gioras did not do? or what
kind of abuses did he abstain from as to those very free-men who had set
him up for a tyrant? What friendship or kindred were there that did not
make him more bold in his daily murders? for they looked upon the doing
of mischief to strangers only as a work beneath their courage, but
thought their barbarity towards their nearest relations would be a
glorious demonstration thereof. The Idumeans also strove with these
men who should be guilty of the greatest madness! for they [all], vile
wretches as they were, cut the throats of the high priests, that so
no part of a religious regard to God might be preserved; they
thence proceeded to destroy utterly the least remains of a political
government, and introduced the most complete scene of iniquity in all
instances that were practicable; under which scene that sort of people
that were called zealots grew up, and who indeed corresponded to
the name; for they imitated every wicked work; nor, if their memory
suggested any evil thing that had formerly been done, did they avoid
zealously to pursue the same; and although they gave themselves that
name from their zeal for what was good, yet did it agree to them only
by way of irony, on account of those they had unjustly treated by their
wild and brutish disposition, or as thinking the greatest mischiefs to
be the greatest good. Accordingly, they all met with such ends as God
deservedly brought upon them in way of punishment; for all such miseries
have been sent upon them as man&#x27;s nature is capable of undergoing,
till the utmost period of their lives, and till death came upon them
in various ways of torment; yet might one say justly that they suffered
less than they had done, because it was impossible they could be
punished according to their deserving. But to make a lamentation
according to the deserts of those who fell under these men&#x27;s barbarity,
this is not a proper place for it;--I therefore now return again to the
remaining part of the present narration.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. For now it was that the Roman general came, and led his army against
Eleazar and those Sicarii who held the fortress Masada together with
him; and for the whole country adjoining, he presently gained it, and
put garrisons into the most proper places of it; he also built a wall
quite round the entire fortress, that none of the besieged might easily
escape; he also set his men to guard the several parts of it; he also
pitched his camp in such an agreeable place as he had chosen for the
siege, and at which place the rock belonging to the fortress did make
the nearest approach to the neighboring mountain, which yet was a place
of difficulty for getting plenty of provisions; for it was not only food
that was to be brought from a great distance [to the army], and this
with a great deal of pain to those Jews who were appointed for that
purpose, but water was also to be brought to the camp, because the place
afforded no fountain that was near it. When therefore Silva had ordered
these affairs beforehand, he fell to besieging the place; which siege
was likely to stand in need of a great deal of skill and pains, by
reason of the strength of the fortress, the nature of which I will now
describe.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. There was a rock, not small in circumference, and very high. It was
encompassed with valleys of such vast depth downward, that the eye could
not reach their bottoms; they were abrupt, and such as no animal could
walk upon, excepting at two places of the rock, where it subsides, in
order to afford a passage for ascent, though not without difficulty.
Now, of the ways that lead to it, one is that from the lake Asphaltites,
towards the sun-rising, and another on the west, where the ascent is
easier: the one of these ways is called the Serpent, as resembling that
animal in its narrowness and its perpetual windings; for it is broken
off at the prominent precipices of the rock, and returns frequently into
itself, and lengthening again by little and little, hath much ado to
proceed forward; and he that would walk along it must first go on one
leg, and then on the other; there is also nothing but destruction, in
case your feet slip; for on each side there is a vastly deep chasm and
precipice, sufficient to quell the courage of every body by the terror
it infuses into the mind. When, therefore, a man hath gone along this
way for thirty furlongs, the rest is the top of the hill--not ending at
a small point, but is no other than a plain upon the highest part of the
mountain. Upon this top of the hill, Jonathan the high priest first of
all built a fortress, and called it Masada: after which the rebuilding
of this place employed the care of king Herod to a great degree; he
also built a wall round about the entire top of the hill, seven furlongs
long; it was composed of white stone; its height was twelve, and
its breadth eight cubits; there were also erected upon that wall
thirty-eight towers, each of them fifty cubits high; out of which you
might pass into lesser edifices, which were built on the inside, round
the entire wall; for the king reserved the top of the hill, which was of
a fat soil, and better mould than any valley for agriculture, that such
as committed themselves to this fortress for their preservation might
not even there be quite destitute of food, in case they should ever be
in want of it from abroad. Moreover, he built a palace therein at the
western ascent; it was within and beneath the walls of the citadel, but
inclined to its north side. Now the wall of this palace was very high
and strong, and had at its four corners towers sixty cubits high. The
furniture also of the edifices, and of the cloisters, and of the
baths, was of great variety, and very costly; and these buildings were
supported by pillars of single stones on every side; the walls and also
the floors of the edifices were paved with stones of several colors. He
also had cut many and great pits, as reservoirs for water, out of the
rocks, at every one of the places that were inhabited, both above and
round about the palace, and before the wall; and by this contrivance
he endeavored to have water for several uses, as if there had been
fountains there. Here was also a road digged from the palace, and
leading to the very top of the mountain, which yet could not be seen by
such as were without [the walls]; nor indeed could enemies easily
make use of the plain roads; for the road on the east side, as we have
already taken notice, could not be walked upon, by reason of its nature;
and for the western road, he built a large tower at its narrowest place,
at no less a distance from the top of the hill than a thousand cubits;
which tower could not possibly be passed by, nor could it be easily
taken; nor indeed could those that walked along it without any fear
[such was its contrivance] easily get to the end of it; and after such
a manner was this citadel fortified, both by nature and by the hands of
men, in order to frustrate the attacks of enemies.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. As for the furniture that was within this fortress, it was still more
wonderful on account of its splendor and long continuance; for here was
laid up corn in large quantities, and such as would subsist men for a
long time; here was also wine and oil in abundance, with all kinds of
pulse and dates heaped up together; all which Eleazar found there, when
he and his Sicarii got possession of the fortress by treachery. These
fruits were also fresh and full ripe, and no way inferior to such fruits
newly laid in, although they were little short of a hundred years 14
from the laying in these provisions [by Herod], till the place was taken
by the Romans; nay, indeed, when the Romans got possession of those
fruits that were left, they found them not corrupted all that while; nor
should we be mistaken, if we supposed that the air was here the cause
of their enduring so long; this fortress being so high, and so free from
the mixture of all terrain and muddy particles of matter. There was also
found here a large quantity of all sorts of weapons of war, which had
been treasured up by that king, and were sufficient for ten thousand
men; there was cast iron, and brass, and tin, which show that he
had taken much pains to have all things here ready for the greatest
occasions; for the report goes how Herod thus prepared this fortress on
his own account, as a refuge against two kinds of danger; the one for
fear of the multitude of the Jews, lest they should depose him, and
restore their former kings to the government; the other danger was
greater and more terrible, which arose from Cleopatra queen of Egypt,
who did not conceal her intentions, but spoke often to Antony, and
desired him to cut off Herod, and entreated him to bestow the kingdom of
Judea upon her. And certainly it is a great wonder that Antony did never
comply with her commands in this point, as he was so miserably enslaved
to his passion for her; nor should any one have been surprised if she
had been gratified in such her request. So the fear of these dangers
made Herod rebuild Masada, and thereby leave it for the finishing stroke
of the Romans in this Jewish war.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">5. Since therefore the Roman commander Silva had now built a wall on the
outside, round about this whole place, as we have said already, and
had thereby made a most accurate provision to prevent any one of the
besieged running away, he undertook the siege itself, though he found
but one single place that would admit of the banks he was to raise; for
behind that tower which secured the road that led to the palace, and to
the top of the hill from the west; there was a certain eminency of the
rock, very broad and very prominent, but three hundred cubits beneath
the highest part of Masada; it was called the White Promontory.
Accordingly, he got upon that part of the rock, and ordered the army
to bring earth; and when they fell to that work with alacrity, and
abundance of them together, the bank was raised, and became solid for
two hundred cubits in height. Yet was not this bank thought sufficiently
high for the use of the engines that were to be set upon it; but still
another elevated work of great stones compacted together was raised upon
that bank; this was fifty cubits, both in breadth and height. The other
machines that were now got ready were like to those that had been first
devised by Vespasian, and afterwards by Titus, for sieges. There was
also a tower made of the height of sixty cubits, and all over plated
with iron, out of which the Romans threw darts and stones from the
engines, and soon made those that fought from the walls of the place to
retire, and would not let them lift up their heads above the works. At
the same time Silva ordered that great battering ram which he had made
to be brought thither, and to be set against the wall, and to make
frequent batteries against it, which with some difficulty broke down
a part of the wall, and quite overthrew it. However, the Sicarii made
haste, and presently built another wall within that, which should not be
liable to the same misfortune from the machines with the other; it was
made soft and yielding, and so was capable of avoiding the terrible
blows that affected the other. It was framed after the following manner:
They laid together great beams of wood lengthways, one close to the end
of another, and the same way in which they were cut: there were two of
these rows parallel to one another, and laid at such a distance from
each other as the breadth of the wall required, and earth was put into
the space between those rows. Now, that the earth might not fall away
upon the elevation of this bank to a greater height, they further laid
other beams over cross them, and thereby bound those beams together that
lay lengthways. This work of theirs was like a real edifice; and when
the machines were applied, the blows were weakened by its yielding; and
as the materials by such concussion were shaken closer together, the
pile by that means became firmer than before. When Silva saw this, he
thought it best to endeavor the taking of this wall by setting fire to
it; so he gave order that the soldiers should throw a great number of
burning torches upon it: accordingly, as it was chiefly made of wood,
it soon took fire; and when it was once set on fire, its hollowness made
that fire spread to a mighty flame. Now, at the very beginning of this
fire, a north wind that then blew proved terrible to the Romans; for by
bringing the flame downward, it drove it upon them, and they were almost
in despair of success, as fearing their machines would be burnt: but
after this, on a sudden the wind changed into the south, as if it were
done by Divine Providence, and blew strongly the contrary way, and
carried the flame, and drove it against the wall, which was now on fire
through its entire thickness. So the Romans, having now assistance
from God, returned to their camp with joy, and resolved to attack their
enemies the very next day; on which occasion they set their watch more
carefully that night, lest any of the Jews should run away from them
without being discovered.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">6. However, neither did Eleazar once think of flying away, nor would he
permit any one else to do so; but when he saw their wall burned down by
the fire, and could devise no other way of escaping, or room for their
further courage, and setting before their eyes what the Romans would do
to them, their children, and their wives, if they got them into their
power, he consulted about having them all slain. Now as he judged this
to be the best thing they could do in their present circumstances, he
gathered the most courageous of his companions together, and encouraged
them to take that course by a speech 15 which he made to them in the
manner following: &quot;Since we, long ago, my generous friends, resolved
never to be servants to the Romans, nor to any other than to God
himself, who alone is the true and just Lord of mankind, the time is now
come that obliges us to make that resolution true in practice. And
let us not at this time bring a reproach upon ourselves for
self-contradiction, while we formerly would not undergo slavery, though
it were then without danger, but must now, together with slavery,
choose such punishments also as are intolerable; I mean this, upon the
supposition that the Romans once reduce us under their power while we
are alive. We were the very first that revolted from them, and we are
the last that fight against them; and I cannot but esteem it as a favor
that God hath granted us, that it is still in our power to die bravely,
and in a state of freedom, which hath not been the case of others, who
were conquered unexpectedly. It is very plain that we shall be taken
within a day&#x27;s time; but it is still an eligible thing to die after a
glorious manner, together with our dearest friends. This is what our
enemies themselves cannot by any means hinder, although they be very
desirous to take us alive. Nor can we propose to ourselves any more
to fight them, and beat them. It had been proper indeed for us to have
conjectured at the purpose of God much sooner, and at the very first,
when we were so desirous of defending our liberty, and when we received
such sore treatment from one another, and worse treatment from our
enemies, and to have been sensible that the same God, who had of old
taken the Jewish nation into his favor, had now condemned them to
destruction; for had he either continued favorable, or been but in a
lesser degree displeased with us, he had not overlooked the destruction
of so many men, or delivered his most holy city to be burnt and
demolished by our enemies. To be sure we weakly hoped to have preserved
ourselves, and ourselves alone, still in a state of freedom, as if we
had been guilty of no sins ourselves against God, nor been partners with
those of others; we also taught other men to preserve their liberty.
Wherefore, consider how God hath convinced us that our hopes were in
vain, by bringing such distress upon us in the desperate state we are
now in, and which is beyond all our expectations; for the nature of this
fortress which was in itself unconquerable, hath not proved a means of
our deliverance; and even while we have still great abundance of food,
and a great quantity of arms, and other necessaries more than we want,
we are openly deprived by God himself of all hope of deliverance; for
that fire which was driven upon our enemies did not of its own accord
turn back upon the wall which we had built; this was the effect of God&#x27;s
anger against us for our manifold sins, which we have been guilty of
in a most insolent and extravagant manner with regard to our own
countrymen; the punishments of which let us not receive from the Romans,
but from God himself, as executed by our own hands; for these will be
more moderate than the other. Let our wives die before they are abused,
and our children before they have tasted of slavery; and after we
have slain them, let us bestow that glorious benefit upon one another
mutually, and preserve ourselves in freedom, as an excellent funeral
monument for us. But first let us destroy our money and the fortress
by fire; for I am well assured that this will be a great grief to the
Romans, that they shall not be able to seize upon our bodies, and shall
fail of our wealth also; and let us spare nothing but our provisions;
for they will be a testimonial when we are dead that we were not subdued
for want of necessaries, but that, according to our original resolution,
we have preferred death before slavery.&quot;</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">7. This was Eleazar&#x27;s speech to them. Yet did not the opinions of all
the auditors acquiesce therein; but although some of them were very
zealous to put his advice in practice, and were in a manner filled with
pleasure at it, and thought death to be a good thing, yet had those that
were most effeminate a commiseration for their wives and families;
and when these men were especially moved by the prospect of their own
certain death, they looked wistfully at one another, and by the tears
that were in their eyes declared their dissent from his opinion.
When Eleazar saw these people in such fear, and that their souls were
dejected at so prodigious a proposal, he was afraid lest perhaps these
effeminate persons should, by their lamentations and tears, enfeeble
those that heard what he had said courageously; so he did not leave
off exhorting them, but stirred up himself, and recollecting proper
arguments for raising their courage, he undertook to speak more briskly
and fully to them, and that concerning the immortality of the soul. So
he made a lamentable groan, and fixing his eyes intently on those that
wept, he spake thus: &quot;Truly, I was greatly mistaken when I thought to be
assisting to brave men who struggled hard for their liberty, and to such
as were resolved either to live with honor, or else to die; but I find
that you are such people as are no better than others, either in virtue
or in courage, and are afraid of dying, though you be delivered thereby
from the greatest miseries, while you ought to make no delay in this
matter, nor to await any one to give you good advice; for the laws of
our country, and of God himself, have from ancient times, and as soon as
ever we could use our reason, continually taught us, and our forefathers
have corroborated the same doctrine by their actions, and by their
bravery of mind, that it is life that is a calamity to men, and not
death; for this last affords our souls their liberty, and sends them
by a removal into their own place of purity, where they are to be
insensible of all sorts of misery; for while souls are tied down to a
mortal body, they are partakers of its miseries; and really, to speak
the truth, they are themselves dead; for the union of what is divine
to what is mortal is disagreeable. It is true, the power of the soul
is great, even when it is imprisoned in a mortal body; for by moving it
after a way that is invisible, it makes the body a sensible instrument,
and causes it to advance further in its actions than mortal nature could
otherwise do. However, when it is freed from that weight which draws it
down to the earth and is connected with it, it obtains its own proper
place, and does then become a partaker of that blessed power, and those
abilities, which are then every way incapable of being hindered in their
operations. It continues invisible, indeed, to the eyes of men, as does
God himself; for certainly it is not itself seen while it is in the
body; for it is there after an invisible manner, and when it is freed
from it, it is still not seen. It is this soul which hath one nature,
and that an incorruptible one also; but yet it is the cause of the
change that is made in the body; for whatsoever it be which the soul
touches, that lives and flourishes; and from whatsoever it is removed,
that withers away and dies; such a degree is there in it of immortality.
Let me produce the state of sleep as a most evident demonstration of
the truth of what I say; wherein souls, when the body does not distract
them, have the sweetest rest depending on themselves, and conversing
with God, by their alliance to him; they then go every where, and
foretell many futurities beforehand. And why are we afraid of death,
while we are pleased with the rest that we have in sleep? And how absurd
a thing is it to pursue after liberty while we are alive, and yet to
envy it to ourselves where it will be eternal! We, therefore, who have
been brought up in a discipline of our own, ought to become an example
to others of our readiness to die. Yet, if we do stand in need of
foreigners to support us in this matter, let us regard those Indians
who profess the exercise of philosophy; for these good men do but
unwillingly undergo the time of life, and look upon it as a necessary
servitude, and make haste to let their souls loose from their bodies;
nay, when no misfortune presses them to it, nor drives them upon it,
these have such a desire of a life of immortality, that they tell other
men beforehand that they are about to depart; and nobody hinders them,
but every one thinks them happy men, and gives them letters to be
carried to their familiar friends [that are dead], so firmly and
certainly do they believe that souls converse with one another [in the
other world]. So when these men have heard all such commands that were
to be given them, they deliver their body to the fire; and, in order
to their getting their soul a separation from the body in the greatest
purity, they die in the midst of hymns of commendations made to them;
for their dearest friends conduct them to their death more readily than
do any of the rest of mankind conduct their fellow-citizens when they
are going a very long journey, who at the same time weep on their own
account, but look upon the others as happy persons, as so soon to be
made partakers of the immortal order of beings. Are not we, therefore,
ashamed to have lower notions than the Indians? and by our own cowardice
to lay a base reproach upon the laws of our country, which are so much
desired and imitated by all mankind? But put the case that we had
been brought up under another persuasion, and taught that life is the
greatest good which men are capable of, and that death is a calamity;
however, the circumstances we are now in ought to be an inducement to us
to bear such calamity courageously, since it is by the will of God, and
by necessity, that we are to die; for it now appears that God hath
made such a decree against the whole Jewish nation, that we are to be
deprived of this life which [he knew] we would not make a due use
of. For do not you ascribe the occasion of our present condition to
yourselves, nor think the Romans are the true occasion that this war we
have had with them is become so destructive to us all: these things
have not come to pass by their power, but a more powerful cause hath
intervened, and made us afford them an occasion of their appearing to be
conquerors over us. What Roman weapons, I pray you, were those by which
the Jews at Cesarea were slain? On the contrary, when they were no way
disposed to rebel, but were all the while keeping their seventh day
festival, and did not so much as lift up their hands against the
citizens of Cesarea, yet did those citizens run upon them in great
crowds, and cut their throats, and the throats of their wives and
children, and this without any regard to the Romans themselves, who
never took us for their enemies till we revolted from them. But some may
be ready to say, that truly the people of Cesarea had always a quarrel
against those that lived among them, and that when an opportunity
offered itself, they only satisfied the old rancor they had against
them. What then shall we say to those of Scythopolis, who ventured to
wage war with us on account of the Greeks? Nor did they do it by way of
revenge upon the Romans, when they acted in concert with our countrymen.
Wherefore you see how little our good-will and fidelity to them profited
us, while they were slain, they and their whole families, after the most
inhuman manner, which was all the requital that was made them for the
assistance they had afforded the others; for that very same destruction
which they had prevented from falling upon the others did they suffer
themselves from them, as if they had been ready to be the actors
against them. It would be too long for me to speak at this time of every
destruction brought upon us; for you cannot but know that there was not
any one Syrian city which did not slay their Jewish inhabitants, and
were not more bitter enemies to us than were the Romans themselves; nay,
even those of Damascus, 16 when they were able to allege no tolerable
pretense against us, filled their city with the most barbarous
slaughters of our people, and cut the throats of eighteen thousand Jews,
with their wives and children. And as to the multitude of those that
were slain in Egypt, and that with torments also, we have been informed
they were more than sixty thousand; those indeed being in a foreign
country, and so naturally meeting with nothing to oppose against their
enemies, were killed in the manner forementioned. As for all those of
us who have waged war against the Romans in our own country, had we not
sufficient reason to have sure hopes of victory? For we had arms, and
walls, and fortresses so prepared as not to be easily taken, and courage
not to be moved by any dangers in the cause of liberty, which encouraged
us all to revolt from the Romans. But then these advantages sufficed
us but for a short time, and only raised our hopes, while they really
appeared to be the origin of our miseries; for all we had hath been
taken from us, and all hath fallen under our enemies, as if these
advantages were only to render their victory over us the more glorious,
and were not disposed for the preservation of those by whom these
preparations were made. And as for those that are already dead in the
war, it is reasonable we should esteem them blessed, for they are
dead in defending, and not in betraying their liberty; but as to the
multitude of those that are now under the Romans, who would not pity
their condition? and who would not make haste to die, before he would
suffer the same miseries with them? Some of them have been put upon the
rack, and tortured with fire and whippings, and so died. Some have been
half devoured by wild beasts, and yet have been reserved alive to be
devoured by them a second time, in order to afford laughter and sport to
our enemies; and such of those as are alive still are to be looked on as
the most miserable, who, being so desirous of death, could not come
at it. And where is now that great city, the metropolis of the Jewish
nation, which was fortified by so many walls round about, which had
so many fortresses and large towers to defend it, which could hardly
contain the instruments prepared for the war, and which had so many ten
thousands of men to fight for it? Where is this city that was believed
to have God himself inhabiting therein? It is now demolished to the very
foundations, and hath nothing but that monument of it preserved, I mean
the camp of those that hath destroyed it, which still dwells upon its
ruins; some unfortunate old men also lie upon the ashes of the temple,
and a few women are there preserved alive by the enemy, for our bitter
shame and reproach. Now who is there that revolves these things in his
mind, and yet is able to bear the sight of the sun, though he might live
out of danger? Who is there so much his country&#x27;s enemy, or so unmanly,
and so desirous of living, as not to repent that he is still alive? And
I cannot but wish that we had all died before we had seen that holy city
demolished by the hands of our enemies, or the foundations of our holy
temple dug up after so profane a manner. But since we had a generous
hope that deluded us, as if we might perhaps have been able to avenge
ourselves on our enemies on that account, though it be now become
vanity, and hath left us alone in this distress, let us make haste to
die bravely. Let us pity ourselves, our children, and our wives while it
is in our own power to show pity to them; for we were born to die, 17 as
well as those were whom we have begotten; nor is it in the power of the
most happy of our race to avoid it. But for abuses, and slavery, and
the sight of our wives led away after an ignominious manner, with their
children, these are not such evils as are natural and necessary among
men; although such as do not prefer death before those miseries, when it
is in their power so to do, must undergo even them, on account of their
own cowardice. We revolted from the Romans with great pretensions
to courage; and when, at the very last, they invited us to preserve
ourselves, we would not comply with them. Who will not, therefore,
believe that they will certainly be in a rage at us, in case they can
take us alive? Miserable will then be the young men who will be strong
enough in their bodies to sustain many torments! miserable also will
be those of elder years, who will not be able to bear those calamities
which young men might sustain! One man will be obliged to hear the voice
of his son implore help of his father, when his hands are bound. But
certainly our hands are still at liberty, and have a sword in them; let
them then be subservient to us in our glorious design; let us die before
we become slaves under our enemies, and let us go out of the world,
together with our children and our wives, in a state of freedom. This
it is that our laws command us to do; this it is that our wives
and children crave at our hands; nay, God himself hath brought this
necessity upon us; while the Romans desire the contrary, and are afraid
lest any of us should die before we are taken. Let us therefore make
haste, and instead of affording them so much pleasure, as they hope
for in getting us under their power, let us leave them an example
which shall at once cause their astonishment at our death, and their
admiration of our hardiness therein.&quot;</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 9.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">How The People That Were In The Fortress Were Prevailed On
     By The Words Of Eleazar, Two Women And Five Children Only
     Excepted And All Submitted To Be Killed By One Another.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now as Eleazar was proceeding on in this exhortation, they all
cut him off short, and made haste to do the work, as full of an
unconquerable ardor of mind, and moved with a demoniacal fury. So they
went their ways, as one still endeavoring to be before another, and as
thinking that this eagerness would be a demonstration of their courage
and good conduct, if they could avoid appearing in the last class; so
great was the zeal they were in to slay their wives and children, and
themselves also! Nor indeed, when they came to the work itself, did
their courage fail them, as one might imagine it would have done, but
they then held fast the same resolution, without wavering, which they
had upon the hearing of Eleazar&#x27;s speech, while yet every one of them
still retained the natural passion of love to themselves and their
families, because the reasoning they went upon appeared to them to be
very just, even with regard to those that were dearest to them; for the
husbands tenderly embraced their wives, and took their children into
their arms, and gave the longest parting kisses to them, with tears
in their eyes. Yet at the same time did they complete what they had
resolved on, as if they had been executed by the hands of strangers; and
they had nothing else for their comfort but the necessity they were in
of doing this execution, to avoid that prospect they had of the miseries
they were to suffer from their enemies. Nor was there at length any
one of these men found that scrupled to act their part in this terrible
execution, but every one of them despatched his dearest relations.
Miserable men indeed were they! whose distress forced them to slay their
own wives and children with their own hands, as the lightest of those
evils that were before them. So they being not able to bear the grief
they were under for what they had done any longer, and esteeming it an
injury to those they had slain, to live even the shortest space of time
after them, they presently laid all they had upon a heap, and set fire
to it. They then chose ten men by lot out of them to slay all the rest;
every one of whom laid himself down by his wife and children on the
ground, and threw his arms about them, and they offered their necks to
the stroke of those who by lot executed that melancholy office; and when
these ten had, without fear, slain them all, they made the same rule for
casting lots for themselves, that he whose lot it was should first kill
the other nine, and after all should kill himself. Accordingly, all
these had courage sufficient to be no way behind one another in doing
or suffering; so, for a conclusion, the nine offered their necks to the
executioner, and he who was the last of all took a view of all the
other bodies, lest perchance some or other among so many that were slain
should want his assistance to be quite despatched, and when he perceived
that they were all slain, he set fire to the palace, and with the great
force of his hand ran his sword entirely through himself, and fell
down dead near to his own relations. So these people died with this
intention, that they would not leave so much as one soul among them all
alive to be subject to the Romans. Yet was there an ancient woman,
and another who was of kin to Eleazar, and superior to most women in
prudence and learning, with five children, who had concealed themselves
in caverns under ground, and had carried water thither for their drink,
and were hidden there when the rest were intent upon the slaughter of
one another. Those others were nine hundred and sixty in number, the
women and children being withal included in that computation. This
calamitous slaughter was made on the fifteenth day of the month
Xanthicus [Nisan].</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. Now for the Romans, they expected that they should be fought in the
morning, when, accordingly, they put on their armor, and laid bridges of
planks upon their ladders from their banks, to make an assault upon the
fortress, which they did; but saw nobody as an enemy, but a terrible
solitude on every side, with a fire within the place, as well as a
perfect silence. So they were at a loss to guess at what had happened.
At length they made a shout, as if it had been at a blow given by the
battering ram, to try whether they could bring any one out that was
within; the women heard this noise, and came out of their under-ground
cavern, and informed the Romans what had been done, as it was done; and
the second of them clearly described all both what was said and what
was done, and this manner of it; yet did they not easily give their
attention to such a desperate undertaking, and did not believe it could
be as they said; they also attempted to put the fire out, and quickly
cutting themselves a way through it, they came within the palace, and so
met with the multitude of the slain, but could take no pleasure in the
fact, though it were done to their enemies. Nor could they do other than
wonder at the courage of their resolution, and the immovable contempt of
death which so great a number of them had shown, when they went through
with such an action as that was.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 10.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">That Many Of The Sicarii Fled To Alexandria Also And What
     Dangers They Were In There; On Which Account That Temple
     Which Had Formerly Been Built By Onias The High Priest Was
     Destroyed.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. When Masada was thus taken, the general left a garrison in the
fortress to keep it, and he himself went away to Cesarea; for there were
now no enemies left in the country, but it was all overthrown by so long
a war. Yet did this war afford disturbances and dangerous disorders even
in places very far remote from Judea; for still it came to pass that
many Jews were slain at Alexandria in Egypt; for as many of the Sicarii
as were able to fly thither, out of the seditious wars in Judea, were
not content to have saved themselves, but must needs be undertaking to
make new disturbances, and persuaded many of those that entertained
them to assert their liberty, to esteem the Romans to be no better than
themselves, and to look upon God as their only Lord and Master. But when
part of the Jews of reputation opposed them, they slew some of them, and
with the others they were very pressing in their exhortations to revolt
from the Romans; but when the principal men of the senate saw what
madness they were come to, they thought it no longer safe for themselves
to overlook them. So they got all the Jews together to an assembly, and
accused the madness of the Sicarii, and demonstrated that they had been
the authors of all the evils that had come upon them. They said also
that &quot;these men, now they were run away from Judea, having no sure hope
of escaping, because as soon as ever they shall be known, they will be
soon destroyed by the Romans, they come hither and fill us full of those
calamities which belong to them, while we have not been partakers with
them in any of their sins.&quot; Accordingly, they exhorted the multitude to
have a care, lest they should be brought to destruction by their means,
and to make their apology to the Romans for what had been done,
by delivering these men up to them; who being thus apprized of the
greatness of the danger they were in, complied with what was proposed,
and ran with great violence upon the Sicarii, and seized upon them; and
indeed six hundred of them were caught immediately: but as to all those
that fled into Egypt 18 and to the Egyptian Thebes, it was not long ere
they were caught also, and brought back, whose courage, or whether we
ought to call it madness, or hardiness in their opinions, every body was
amazed at. For when all sorts of torments and vexations of their bodies
that could be devised were made use of to them, they could not get any
one of them to comply so far as to confess, or seem to confess, that
Caesar was their lord; but they preserved their own opinion, in spite
of all the distress they were brought to, as if they received these
torments and the fire itself with bodies insensible of pain, and with
a soul that in a manner rejoiced under them. But what was most of all
astonishing to the beholders was the courage of the children; for not
one of these children was so far overcome by these torments, as to name
Caesar for their lord. So far does the strength of the courage [of the
soul] prevail over the weakness of the body.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. Now Lupus did then govern Alexandria, who presently sent Caesar word
of this commotion; who having in suspicion the restless temper of the
Jews for innovation, and being afraid lest they should get together
again, and persuade some others to join with them, gave orders to Lupus
to demolish that Jewish temple which was in the region called Onion,
19 and was in Egypt, which was built and had its denomination from the
occasion following: Onias, the son of Simon, one of the Jewish high
priests fled from Antiochus the king of Syria, when he made war with the
Jews, and came to Alexandria; and as Ptolemy received him very kindly,
on account of hatred to Antiochus, he assured him, that if he would
comply with his proposal, he would bring all the Jews to his assistance;
and when the king agreed to do it so far as he was able, he desired him
to give him leave to build a temple some where in Egypt, and to worship
God according to the customs of his own country; for that the Jews would
then be so much readier to fight against Antiochus who had laid waste
the temple at Jerusalem, and that they would then come to him with
greater good-will; and that, by granting them liberty of conscience,
very many of them would come over to him.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. So Ptolemy complied with his proposals, and gave him a place one
hundred and eighty furlongs distant from Memphis. 20 That Nomos was
called the Nomos of Hellopolis, where Onias built a fortress and a
temple, not like to that at Jerusalem, but such as resembled a tower.
He built it of large stones to the height of sixty cubits; he made the
structure of the altar in imitation of that in our own country, and in
like manner adorned with gifts, excepting the make of the candlestick,
for he did not make a candlestick, but had a [single] lamp hammered out
of a piece of gold, which illuminated the place with its rays, and which
he hung by a chain of gold; but the entire temple was encompassed with
a wall of burnt brick, though it had gates of stone. The king also gave
him a large country for a revenue in money, that both the priests might
have a plentiful provision made for them, and that God might have great
abundance of what things were necessary for his worship. Yet did not
Onias do this out of a sober disposition, but he had a mind to contend
with the Jews at Jerusalem, and could not forget the indignation he had
for being banished thence. Accordingly, he thought that by building this
temple he should draw away a great number from them to himself. There
had been also a certain ancient prediction made by [a prophet] whose
name was Isaiah, about six hundred years before, that this temple should
be built by a man that was a Jew in Egypt. And this is the history of
the building of that temple.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. And now Lupus, the governor of Alexandria, upon the receipt of
Caesar&#x27;s letter, came to the temple, and carried out of it some of the
donations dedicated thereto, and shut up the temple itself. And as Lupus
died a little afterward, Paulinus succeeded him. This man left none of
those donations there, and threatened the priests severely if they
did not bring them all out; nor did he permit any who were desirous of
worshipping God there so much as to come near the whole sacred place;
but when he had shut up the gates, he made it entirely inaccessible,
insomuch that there remained no longer the least footsteps of any Divine
worship that had been in that place. Now the duration of the time from
the building of this temple till it was shut up again was three hundred
and forty-three years.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 11.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">Concerning Jonathan, One Of The Sicarii, That Stirred Up A
     Sedition In Cyrene, And Was A False Accuser [Of The
     Innocent].</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. And now did the madness of the Sicarii, like a disease, reach as far
as the cities of Cyrene; for one Jonathan, a vile person, and by trade
a weaver, came thither and prevailed with no small number of the
poorer sort to give ear to him; he also led them into the desert, upon
promising them that he would show them signs and apparitions. And as for
the other Jews of Cyrene, he concealed his knavery from them, and put
tricks upon them; but those of the greatest dignity among them informed
Catullus, the governor of the Libyan Pentapolis, of his march into the
desert, and of the preparations he had made for it. So he sent out after
him both horsemen and footmen, and easily overcame them, because they
were unarmed men; of these many were slain in the fight, but some were
taken alive, and brought to Catullus. As for Jonathan, the head of this
plot, he fled away at that time; but upon a great and very diligent
search, which was made all the country over for him, he was at last
taken. And when he was brought to Catullus, he devised a way whereby he
both escaped punishment himself, and afforded an occasion to Catullus
of doing much mischief; for he falsely accused the richest men among the
Jews, and said that they had put him upon what he did.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. Now Catullus easily admitted of these his calumnies, and aggravated
matters greatly, and made tragical exclamations, that he might also be
supposed to have had a hand in the finishing of the Jewish war. But what
was still harder, he did not only give a too easy belief to his stories,
but he taught the Sicarii to accuse men falsely. He bid this Jonathan,
therefore, to name one Alexander, a Jew [with whom he had formerly had
a quarrel, and openly professed that he hated him]; he also got him to
name his wife Bernice, as concerned with him. These two Catullus ordered
to be slain in the first place; nay, after them he caused all the rich
and wealthy Jews to be slain, being no fewer in all than three thousand.
This he thought he might do safely, because he confiscated their
effects, and added them to Caesar&#x27;s revenues.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. Nay, indeed, lest any Jews that lived elsewhere should convict him of
his villainy, he extended his false accusations further, and persuaded
Jonathan, and certain others that were caught with him, to bring an
accusation of attempts for innovation against the Jews that were of the
best character both at Alexandria and at Rome. One of these, against
whom this treacherous accusation was laid, was Josephus, the writer of
these books. However, this plot, thus contrived by Catullus, did not
succeed according to his hopes; for though he came himself to Rome, and
brought Jonathan and his companions along with him in bonds, and thought
he should have had no further inquisition made as to those lies that
were forged under his government, or by his means; yet did Vespasian
suspect the matter and made an inquiry how far it was true. And when he
understood that the accusation laid against the Jews was an unjust one,
he cleared them of the crimes charged upon them, and this on account of
Titus&#x27;s concern about the matter, and brought a deserved punishment upon
Jonathan; for he was first tormented, and then burnt alive.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. But as to Catullus, the emperors were so gentle to him, that he
underwent no severe condemnation at this time; yet was it not long
before he fell into a complicated and almost incurable distemper, and
died miserably. He was not only afflicted in body, but the distemper
in his mind was more heavy upon him than the other; for he was terribly
disturbed, and continually cried out that he saw the ghosts of those
whom he had slain standing before him. Where upon he was not able to
contain himself, but leaped out of his bed, as if both torments and fire
were brought to him. This his distemper grew still a great deal worse
and worse continually, and his very entrails were so corroded, that they
fell out of his body, and in that condition he died. Thus he became as
great an instance of Divine Providence as ever was, and demonstrated
that God punishes wicked men.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">5. And here we shall put an end to this our history; wherein we formerly
promised to deliver the same with all accuracy, to such as should be
desirous of understanding after what manner this war of the Romans with
the Jews was managed. Of which history, how good the style is, must be
left to the determination of the readers; but as for its agreement with
the facts, I shall not scruple to say, and that boldly, that truth hath
been what I have alone aimed at through its entire composition.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">WAR BOOK 7 FOOTNOTES 2 (return) [ This Tereutius Rufus, as Reland in
part observes here, is the same person whom the Talmudists call Turnus
Rufus; of whom they relate, that &quot;he ploughed up Sion as a field, and
made Jerusalem become as heaps, and the mountain of the house as the
high Idaces of a forest;&quot; which was long before foretold by the prophet
Micah, ch. 3:12, and quoted from him in the prophecies of Jeremiah, ch.
26:18.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3 (return) [ See Ecclesiastes 8:11.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4 (return) [ This Berytus was certainly a Roman colony, and has coins
extant that witness the same, as Hudson and Spanheim inform us. See the
note on Antiq. B. XVI: ch. 11. sect. 1.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">5 (return) [ The Jews at Antioch and Alexandria, the two principal
cities in all the East, had allowed them, both by the Macedonians, and
afterwards by the Romans, a governor of their own, who was exempt from
the jurisdiction of the other civil governors. He was called sometimes
barely &quot;governor,&quot; sometimes &quot;ethnarch,&quot; and [at Alexandria] &quot;alabarch,&quot;
as Dr. Hudson takes notice on this place out of Fuller&#x27;s Miscellanies.
They had the like governor or governors allowed them at Babylon under
their captivity there, as the history of Susanna implies.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">6 (return) [ This Classicus, and Civilis, and Cerealis are names well
known in Tacitus; the two former as moving sedition against the Romans,
and the last as sent to repress them by Vespasian, just as they are here
described in Josephus; which is the case also of Fontellis Agrippa
and Rubrius Gallup, i, sect. 3. But as to the very favorable account
presently given of Domitian, particularly as to his designs in this his
Gallic and German expedition, it is not a little contrary to that in
Suetonius, Vesp. sect. 7. Nor are the reasons unobvious that might
occasion this great diversity: Domitian was one of Josephus&#x27;s patrons,
and when he published these books of the Jewish war, was very young, and
had hardly begun those wicked practices which rendered him so infamous
afterward; while Suetonius seems to have been too young, and too low
in life, to receive any remarkable favors from him; as Domitian was
certainly very lewd and cruel, and generally hated, when Suetonius wrote
about him.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">7 (return) [ Since in these latter ages this Sabbatic River, once so
famous, which, by Josephus&#x27;s account here, ran every seventh day,
and rested on six, but according to Pliny, Nat. Hist. 31. II, ran
perpetually on six days, and rested every seventh, [though it no way
appears by either of their accounts that the seventh day of this river
was the Jewish seventh day or sabbath,] is quite vanished, I shall add
no more about it: only see Dr. Hudson&#x27;s note. In Varenius&#x27;s Geography,
i, 17, the reader will find several instances of such periodical
fountains and rivers, though none of their periods were that of a just
week as of old this appears to have been.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">8 (return) [ Vespasian and his two sons, Titus and Domitian.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">9 (return) [ See the representations of these Jewish vessels as they
still stand on Titus&#x27;s triumphal arch at Rome, in Reland&#x27;s very curious</p>
