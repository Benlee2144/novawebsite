        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 6. How The Philistines Made Another Expedition Against The
Hebrews And Were Beaten.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now Saul chose out of the multitude about three thousand men, and he
took two thousand of them to be the guards of his own body, and abode in
the city Bethel, but he gave the rest of them to Jonathan his son, to be
the guards of his body; and sent him to Gibeah, where he besieged and
took a certain garrison of the Philistines, not far from Gilgal; for the
Philistines of Gibeah had beaten the Jews, and taken their weapons away,
and had put garrisons into the strongest places of the country, and had
forbidden them to carry any instrument of iron, or at all to make use of
any iron in any case whatsoever. And on account of this prohibition it
was that the husbandmen, if they had occasion to sharpen any of their
tools, whether it were the coulter or the spade, or any instrument of
husbandry, they came to the Philistines to do it. Now as soon as the
Philistines heard of this slaughter of their garrison, they were in a
rage about it, and, looking on this contempt as a terrible affront
offered them, they made war against the Jews, with three hundred
thousand footmen, and thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horses;
and they pitched their camp at the city Michmash. When Saul, the king of
the Hebrews, was informed of this, he went down to the city Gilgal, and
made proclamation over all the country, that they should try to regain
their liberty; and called them to the war against the Philistines,
diminishing their forces, and despising them as not very considerable,
and as not so great but they might hazard a battle with them. But when
the people about Saul observed how numerous the Philistines were, they
were under a great consternation; and some of them hid themselves in
caves and in dens under ground, but the greater part fled into the land
beyond Jordan, which belonged to Gad and Reuben.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. But Saul sent to the prophet, and called him to consult with him
about the war and the public affairs; so he commanded him to stay there
for him, and to prepare sacrifices, for he would come to him within
seven days, that they might offer sacrifices on the seventh day, and
might then join battle with their enemies. So he waited 11 as the
prophet sent to him to do; yet did not he, however, observe the command
that was given him, but when he saw that the prophet tarried longer than
he expected, and that he was deserted by the soldiers, he took the
sacrifices and offered them; and when he heard that Samuel was come, he
went out to meet him. But the prophet said he had not done well in
disobeying the injunctions he had sent to him, and had not staid till
his coming, which being appointed according to the will of God, he had
prevented him in offering up those prayers and those sacrifices that he
should have made for the multitude, and that he therefore had performed
Divine offices in an ill manner, and had been rash in performing them.
Hereupon Saul made an apology for himself, and said that he had waited
as many days as Samuel had appointed him; that he had been so quick in
offering his sacrifices, upon account of the necessity he was in, and
because his soldiers were departing from him, out of their fear of the
enemy&#x27;s camp at Michmash, the report being gone abroad that they were
coming down upon him of Gilgal. To which Samuel replied, &quot;Nay,
certainly, if thou hadst been a righteous man, 12 and hadst not
disobeyed me, nor slighted the commands which God suggested to me
concerning the present state of affairs, and hadst not acted more
hastily than the present circumstances required, thou wouldst have been
permitted to reign a long time, and thy posterity after thee.&quot; So
Samuel, being grieved at what happened, returned home; but Saul came to
the city Gibeah, with his son Jonathan, having only six hundred men with
him; and of these the greater part had no weapons, because of the
scarcity of iron in that country, as well as of those that could make
such weapons; for, as we showed a little before, the Philistines had not
suffered them to have such iron or such workmen. Now the Philistines
divided their army into three companies, and took as many roads, and
laid waste the country of the Hebrews, while king Saul and his son
Jonathan saw what was done, but were not able to defend the land, having
no more than six hundred men with them. But as he, and his son, and
Abiah the high priest, who was of the posterity of Eli the high priest,
were sitting upon a pretty high hill, and seeing the land laid waste,
they were mightily disturbed at it. Now Saul&#x27;s son agreed with his
armor-bearer, that they would go privately to the enemy&#x27;s camp, and make
a tumult and a disturbance among them. And when the armor-bearer had
readily promised to follow him whithersoever he should lead him, though
he should be obliged to die in the attempt, Jonathan made use of the
young man&#x27;s assistance, and descended from the hill, and went to their
enemies. Now the enemy&#x27;s camp was upon a precipice which had three tops,
that ended in a small but sharp and long extremity, while there was a
rock that surrounded them, like lines made to prevent the attacks of an
enemy. There it so happened, that the out-guards of the camp were
neglected, because of the security that here arose from the situation of
the place, and because they thought it altogether impossible, not only
to ascend up to the camp on that quarter, but so much as to come near
it. As soon, therefore, as they came to the camp, Jonathan encouraged
his armor-bearer, and said to him, &quot;Let us attack our enemies; and if,
when they see us, they bid us come up to them, take that for a signal of
victory; but if they say nothing, as not intending to invite us to come
up, let us return back again.&quot; So when they were approaching to the
enemy&#x27;s camp, just after break of day, and the Philistines saw them,
they said one to another, &quot;The Hebrews come out of their dens and
caves:&quot; and they said to Jonathan and to his armor-bearer, &quot;Come on,
ascend up to us, that we may inflict a just punishment upon you, for
your rash attempt upon us.&quot; So Saul&#x27;s son accepted of that invitation,
as what signified to him victory, and he immediately came out of the
place whence they were seen by their enemies: so he changed his place,
and came to the rock, which had none to guard it, because of its own
strength; from thence they crept up with great labor and difficulty, and
so far overcame by force the nature of the place, till they were able to
fight with their enemies. So they fell upon them as they were asleep,
and slew about twenty of them, and thereby filled them with disorder and
surprise, insomuch that some of them threw away their entire armor and
fled; but the greatest part, not knowing one another, because they were
of different nations, suspected one another to be enemies, [for they did
not imagine there were only two of the Hebrews that came up,] and so
they fought one against another; and some of them died in the battle,
and some, as they were flying away, were thrown down from the rock
headlong.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. Now Saul&#x27;s watchmen told the king that the camp of the Philistines
was in confusion; then he inquired whether any body was gone away from
the army; and when he heard that his son, and with him his armor-bearer,
were absent, he bade the high priest take the garments of his high
priesthood, and prophesy to him what success they should have; who said
that they should get the victory, and prevail against their enemies. So
he went out after the Philistines, and set upon them as they were
slaying one another. Those also who had fled to dens and caves, upon
hearing that Saul was gaining a victory, came running to him. When,
therefore, the number of the Hebrews that came to Saul amounted to about
ten thousand, he pursued the enemy, who were scattered all over the
country; but then he fell into an action, which was a very unhappy one,
and liable to be very much blamed; for, whether out of ignorance or
whether out of joy for a victory gained so strangely, [for it frequently
happens that persons so fortunate are not then able to use their reason
consistently,] as he was desirous to avenge himself, and to exact a due
punishment of the Philistines, he denounced a curse 13 upon the Hebrews:
That if any one put a stop to his slaughter of the enemy, and fell on
eating, and left off the slaughter or the pursuit before the night came
on, and obliged them so to do, he should be accursed. Now after Saul had
denounced this curse, since they were now in a wood belonging to the
tribe of Ephraim, which was thick and full of bees, Saul&#x27;s son, who did
not hear his father denounce that curse, nor hear of the approbation the
multitude gave to it, broke off a piece of a honey-comb, and ate part of
it. But, in the mean time, he was informed with what a curse his father
had forbidden them to taste any thing before sun-setting: so he left off
eating, and said his father had not done well in this prohibition,
because, had they taken some food, they had pursued the enemy with
greater rigor and alacrity, and had both taken and slain many more of
their enemies.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. When, therefore, they had slain many ten thousands of the
Philistines, they fell upon spoiling the camp of the Philistines, but
not till late in the evening. They also took a great deal of prey and
cattle, and killed them, and ate them with their blood. This was told to
the king by the scribes, that the multitude were sinning against God as
they sacrificed, and were eating before the blood was well washed away,
and the flesh was made clean. Then did Saul give order that a great
stone should be rolled into the midst of them, and he made proclamation
that they should kill their sacrifices upon it, and not feed upon the
flesh with the blood, for that was not acceptable to God. And when all
the people did as the king commanded them, Saul erected an altar there,
and offered burnt-offerings upon it to God 14 This was the first altar
that Saul built.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">5. So when Saul was desirous of leading his men to the enemy&#x27;s camp
before it was day, in order to plunder it, and when the soldiers were
not unwilling to follow him, but indeed showed great readiness to do as
he commanded them, the king called Ahitub the high priest, and enjoined
him to know of God whether he would grant them the favor and permission
to go against the enemy&#x27;s camp, in order to destroy those that were in
it. And when the priest said that God did not give any answer, Saul
replied, &quot;And not without some cause does God refuse to answer what we
inquire of him, while yet a little while ago he declared to us all that
we desired beforehand, and even prevented us in his answer. To be sure
there is some sin against him that is concealed from us, which is the
occasion of his silence. Now I swear by him himself, that though he that
hath committed this sin should prove to be my own son Jonathan, I will
slay him, and by that means will appease the anger of God against us,
and that in the very same manner as if I were to punish a stranger, and
one not at all related to me, for the same offense.&quot; So when the
multitude cried out to him so to do, he presently set all the rest on
one side, and he and his son stood on the other side, and he sought to
discover the offender by lot. Now the lot appeared to fall upon Jonathan
himself. So when he was asked by his father what sin he had been guilty
of, and what he was conscious of in the course of his life that might be
esteemed instances of guilt or profaneness, his answer was this, &quot;O
father, I have done nothing more than that yesterday, without knowing of
the curse and oath thou hadst denounced, while I was in pursuit of the
enemy, I tasted of a honey-comb.&quot; But Saul sware that he would slay him,
and prefer the observation of his oath before all the ties of birth and
of nature. And Jonathan was not dismayed at this threatening of death,
but, offering himself to it generously and undauntedly, he said, &quot;Nor do
I desire you, father, to spare me: death will be to me very acceptable,
when it proceeds from thy piety, and after a glorious victory; for it is
the greatest consolation to me that I leave the Hebrews victorious over
the Philistines.&quot; Hereupon all the people were very sorry, and greatly
afflicted for Jonathan; and they sware that they would not overlook
Jonathan, and see him die, who was the author of their victory. By which
means they snatched him out of the danger he was in from his father&#x27;s
curse, while they made their prayers to God also for the young man, that
he would remit his sin.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">6. So Saul, having slain about sixty thousand of the enemy, returned
home to his own city, and reigned happily: and he also fought against
the neighboring nations, and subdued the Ammonites, and Moabites, and
Philistines, and Edomites, and Amalekites, as also the king of Zobah. He
had three male children, Jonathan, and Isui, and Melchishua; with Merab
and Michal his daughters. He had also Abner, his uncle&#x27;s son, for the
captain of his host: that uncle&#x27;s name was Ner. Now Ner, and Kish the
father of Saul, were brothers. Saul had also a great many chariots and
horsemen, and against whomsoever he made war he returned conqueror, and
advanced the affairs of the Hebrews to a great degree of success and
prosperity, and made them superior to other nations; and he made such of
the young men as were remarkable for tallness and comeliness the guards
of his body.</p>
