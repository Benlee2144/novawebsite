        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 8. Of The Death Of Jacob And Joseph.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now when Jacob had lived seventeen years in Egypt, he fell into a
disease, and died in the presence of his sons; but not till he made his
prayers for their enjoying prosperity, and till he had foretold to them
prophetically how every one of them was to dwell in the land of Canaan.
But this happened many years afterward. He also enlarged upon the
praises of Joseph 15 how he had not remembered the evil doings of his
brethren to their disadvantage; nay, on the contrary, was kind to them,
bestowing upon them so many benefits, as seldom are bestowed on men&#x27;s
own benefactors. He then commanded his own sons that they should admit
Joseph&#x27;s sons, Ephraim and Manasses, into their number, and divide the
land of Canaan in common with them; concerning whom we shall treat
hereafter. However, he made it his request that he might be buried at
Hebron. So he died, when he had lived full a hundred and fifty years,
three only abated, having not been behind any of his ancestors in piety
towards God, and having such a recompense for it, as it was fit those
should have who were so good as these were. But Joseph, by the king&#x27;s
permission, carried his father&#x27;s dead body to Hebron, and there buried
it, at a great expense. Now his brethren were at first unwilling to
return back with him, because they were afraid lest, now their father
was dead, he should punish them for their secret practices against him;
since he was now gone, for whose sake he had been so gracious to them.
But he persuaded them to fear no harm, and to entertain no suspicions of
him: so he brought them along with him, and gave them great possessions,
and never left off his particular concern for them.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. Joseph also died when he had lived a hundred and ten years; having
been a man of admirable virtue, and conducting all his affairs by the
rules of reason; and used his authority with moderation, which was the
cause of his so great felicity among the Egyptians, even when he came
from another country, and that in such ill circumstances also, as we
have already described. At length his brethren died, after they had
lived happily in Egypt. Now the posterity and sons of these men, after
some time, carried their bodies, and buried them at Hebron: but as to
the bones of Joseph, they carried them into the land of Canaan
afterward, when the Hebrews went out of Egypt, for so had Joseph made
them promise him upon oath. But what became of every one of these men,
and by what toils they got the possession of the land of Canaan, shall
be shown hereafter, when I have first explained upon what account it was
that they left Egypt.</p>
