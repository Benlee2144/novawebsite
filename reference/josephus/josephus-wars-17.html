        <p>Containing The Interval Of About Three Years.</p>
        <p>From The Taking Of Jerusalem By Titus To The Sedition At
     Cyrene</p>
        <p>CHAPTER 1.</p>
        <p>How The Entire City Of Jerusalem Was Demolished, Excepting
     Three Towers; And How Titus Commended His Soldiers In A
     Speech Made To Them, And Distributed Rewards To Them And
     Then Dismissed Many Of Them.</p>
        <p>1. Now as soon as the army had no more people to slay or to plunder,
because there remained none to be the objects of their fury, [for they
would not have spared any, had there remained any other work to be
done,] Caesar gave orders that they should now demolish the entire city
and temple, but should leave as many of the towers standing as were of
the greatest eminency; that is, Phasaelus, and Hippicus, and Mariamne;
and so much of the wall as enclosed the city on the west side. This
wall was spared, in order to afford a camp for such as were to lie in
garrison, as were the towers also spared, in order to demonstrate to
posterity what kind of city it was, and how well fortified, which the
Roman valor had subdued; but for all the rest of the wall, it was so
thoroughly laid even with the ground by those that dug it up to the
foundation, that there was left nothing to make those that came thither
believe it had ever been inhabited. This was the end which Jerusalem
came to by the madness of those that were for innovations; a city
otherwise of great magnificence, and of mighty fame among all mankind.</p>
        <p>2. But Caesar resolved to leave there, as a guard, the tenth legion,
with certain troops of horsemen, and companies of footmen. So, having
entirely completed this war, he was desirous to commend his whole army,
on account of the great exploits they had performed, and to bestow
proper rewards on such as had signalized themselves therein. He had
therefore a great tribunal made for him in the midst of the place
where he had formerly encamped, and stood upon it with his principal
commanders about him, and spake so as to be heard by the whole army
in the manner following: That he returned them abundance of thanks for
their good-will which they had showed to him: he commended them for that
ready obedience they had exhibited in this whole war, which obedience
had appeared in the many and great dangers which they had courageously
undergone; as also for that courage they had shown, and had thereby
augmented of themselves their country&#x27;s power, and had made it evident
to all men, that neither the multitude of their enemies, nor the
strength of their places, nor the largeness of their cities, nor the
rash boldness and brutish rage of their antagonists, were sufficient at
any time to get clear of the Roman valor, although some of them may have
fortune in many respects on their side. He said further, that it was
but reasonable for them to put an end to this war, now it had lasted
so long, for that they had nothing better to wish for when they entered
into it; and that this happened more favorably for them, and more for
their glory, that all the Romans had willingly accepted of those for
their governors, and the curators of their dominions, whom they had
chosen for them, and had sent into their own country for that purpose,
which still continued under the management of those whom they had
pitched on, and were thankful to them for pitching upon them. That
accordingly, although he did both admire and tenderly regard them all,
because he knew that every one of them had gone as cheerfully about
their work as their abilities and opportunities would give them leave;
yet, he said, that he would immediately bestow rewards and dignities on
those that had fought the most bravely, and with greater force, and had
signalized their conduct in the most glorious manner, and had made his
army more famous by their noble exploits; and that no one who had
been willing to take more pains than another should miss of a just
retribution for the same; for that he had been exceeding careful about
this matter, and that the more, because he had much rather reward the
virtues of his fellow soldiers than punish such as had offended.</p>
        <p>3. Hereupon Titus ordered those whose business it was to read the list
of all that had performed great exploits in this war, whom he called to
him by their names, and commended them before the company, and rejoiced
in them in the same manner as a man would have rejoiced in his own
exploits. He also put on their heads crowns of gold, and golden
ornaments about their necks, and gave them long spears of gold, and
ensigns that were made of silver, and removed every one of them to a
higher rank; and besides this, he plentifully distributed among them,
out of the spoils, and the other prey they had taken, silver, and
gold, and garments. So when they had all these honors bestowed on them,
according to his own appointment made to every one, and he had wished
all sorts of happiness to the whole army, he came down, among the great
acclamations which were made to him, and then betook himself to offer
thank-offerings [to the gods], and at once sacrificed a vast number of
oxen, that stood ready at the altars, and distributed them among the
army to feast on. And when he had staid three days among the principal
commanders, and so long feasted with them, he sent away the rest of his
army to the several places where they would be every one best situated;
but permitted the tenth legion to stay, as a guard at Jerusalem, and did
not send them away beyond Euphrates, where they had been before. And as
he remembered that the twelfth legion had given way to the Jews, under
Cestius their general, he expelled them out of all Syria, for they
had lain formerly at Raphanea, and sent them away to a place called
Meletine, near Euphrates, which is in the limits of Armenia and
Cappadocia; he also thought fit that two of the legions should stay with
him till he should go to Egypt. He then went down with his army to that
Cesarea which lay by the sea-side, and there laid up the rest of his
spoils in great quantities, and gave order that the captives should be
kept there; for the winter season hindered him then from sailing into
Italy.</p>
        <p>CHAPTER 2.</p>
        <p>How Titus Exhibited All Sorts Of Shows At Cesarea Philippi.
     Concerning Simon The Tyrant How He Was Taken, And Reserved
     For The Triumph.</p>
        <p>1. Now at the same time that Titus Caesar lay at the siege of Jerusalem,
did Vespasian go on board a merchantship and sailed from Alexandria to
Rhodes; whence he sailed away in ships with three rows of oars; and
as he touched at several cities that lay in his road, he was joyfully
received by them all, and so passed over from Ionia into Greece; whence
he set sail from Corcyra to the promontory of Iapyx, whence he took his
journey by land. But as for Titus, he marched from that Cesarea which
lay by the sea-side, and came to that which is named Cesarea Philippi,
and staid there a considerable time, and exhibited all sorts of shows
there. And here a great number of the captives were destroyed, some
being thrown to wild beasts, and others in multitudes forced to kill one
another, as if they were their enemies. And here it was that Titus was
informed of the seizure of Simon the son of Gioras, which was made after
the manner following: This Simon, during the siege of Jerusalem, was in
the upper city; but when the Roman army was gotten within the walls,
and were laying the city waste, he then took the most faithful of his
friends with him, and among them some that were stone-cutters, with
those iron tools which belonged to their occupation, and as great a
quantity of provisions as would suffice them for a long time, and let
himself and all them down into a certain subterraneous cavern that was
not visible above ground. Now, so far as had been digged of old, they
went onward along it without disturbance; but where they met with solid
earth, they dug a mine under ground, and this in hopes that they should
be able to proceed so far as to rise from under ground in a safe place,
and by that means escape. But when they came to make the experiment,
they were disappointed of their hope; for the miners could make but
small progress, and that with difficulty also; insomuch that their
provisions, though they distributed them by measure, began to fail
them. And now Simon, thinking he might be able to astonish and elude the
Romans, put on a white frock, and buttoned upon him a purple cloak, and
appeared out of the ground in the place where the temple had formerly
been. At the first, indeed, those that saw him were greatly astonished,
and stood still where they were; but afterward they came nearer to him,
and asked him who he was. Now Simon would not tell them, but bid them
call for their captain; and when they ran to call him, Terentius Rufus
2 who was left to command the army there, came to Simon, and learned of
him the whole truth, and kept him in bonds, and let Caesar know that he
was taken. Thus did God bring this man to be punished for what bitter
and savage tyranny he had exercised against his countrymen by those who
were his worst enemies; and this while he was not subdued by violence,
but voluntarily delivered himself up to them to be punished, and that
on the very same account that he had laid false accusations against many
Jews, as if they were falling away to the Romans, and had barbarously
slain them; for wicked actions do not escape the Divine anger, nor is
justice too weak to punish offenders, but in time overtakes those that
transgress its laws, and inflicts its punishments upon the wicked in a
manner, so much more severe, as they expected to escape it on account of
their not being punished immediately. 3 Simon was made sensible of this
by falling under the indignation of the Romans. This rise of his out of
the ground did also occasion the discovery of a great number of others
of the seditious at that time, who had hidden themselves under ground.
But for Simon, he was brought to Caesar in bonds, when he was come back
to that Cesarea which was on the seaside, who gave orders that he should
be kept against that triumph which he was to celebrate at Rome upon this
occasion.</p>
        <p>CHAPTER 3.</p>
        <p>How Titus Upon The Celebration Of His Brothers And Fathers
     Birthdays Had Many Of The Jews Slain. Concerning The Danger
     The Jews Were In At Antioch, By Means Of The Transgression
     And Impiety Of One Antiochus, A Jew.</p>
        <p>1. While Titus was at Cesarea, he solemnized the birthday of his brother
[Domitian] after a splendid manner, and inflicted a great deal of the
punishment intended for the Jews in honor of him; for the number of
those that were now slain in fighting with the beasts, and were burnt,
and fought with one another, exceeded two thousand five hundred. Yet did
all this seem to the Romans, when they were thus destroyed ten thousand
several ways, to be a punishment beneath their deserts. After this
Caesar came to Berytus, 4 which is a city of Phoenicia, and a Roman
colony, and staid there a longer time, and exhibited a still more
pompous solemnity about his father&#x27;s birthday, both in the magnificence
of the shows, and in the other vast expenses he was at in his devices
thereto belonging; so that a great multitude of the captives were here
destroyed after the same manner as before.</p>
        <p>2. It happened also about this time, that the Jews who remained at
Antioch were under accusations, and in danger of perishing, from the
disturbances that were raised against them by the Antiochians; and this
both on account of the slanders spread abroad at this time against them,
and on account of what pranks they had played not long before; which
I am obliged to describe without fail, though briefly, that I may the
better connect my narration of future actions with those that went
before.</p>
        <p>3. For as the Jewish nation is widely dispersed over all the habitable
earth among its inhabitants, so it is very much intermingled with
Syria by reason of its neighborhood, and had the greatest multitudes in
Antioch by reason of the largeness of the city, wherein the kings, after
Antiochus, had afforded them a habitation with the most undisturbed
tranquillity; for though Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes, laid
Jerusalem waste, and spoiled the temple, yet did those that succeeded
him in the kingdom restore all the donations that were made of brass to
the Jews of Antioch, and dedicated them to their synagogue, and granted
them the enjoyment of equal privileges of citizens with the Greeks
themselves; and as the succeeding kings treated them after the same
manner, they both multiplied to a great number, and adorned their temple
gloriously by fine ornaments, and with great magnificence, in the use of
what had been given them. They also made proselytes of a great many of
the Greeks perpetually, and thereby after a sort brought them to be
a portion of their own body. But about this time when the present war
began, and Vespasian was newly sailed to Syria, and all men had taken
up a great hatred against the Jews, then it was that a certain person,
whose name was Antiochus, being one of the Jewish nation, and greatly
respected on account of his father, who was governor of the Jews at
Antioch 5 came upon the theater at a time when the people of Antioch
were assembled together, and became an informer against his father, and
accused both him and others that they had resolved to burn the whole
city in one night; he also delivered up to them some Jews that were
foreigners, as partners in their resolutions. When the people heard
this, they could not refrain their passion, but commanded that those
who were delivered up to them should have fire brought to burn them, who
were accordingly all burnt upon the theater immediately. They did also
fall violently upon the multitude of the Jews, as supposing that
by punishing them suddenly they should save their own city. As for
Antiochus, he aggravated the rage they were in, and thought to give them
a demonstration of his own conversion, arm of his hatred of the Jewish
customs, by sacrificing after the manner of the Greeks; he persuaded
the rest also to compel them to do the same, because they would by that
means discover who they were that had plotted against them, since they
would not do so; and when the people of Antioch tried the experiment,
some few complied, but those that would not do so were slain. As for
Antiochus himself, he obtained soldiers from the Roman commander, and
became a severe master over his own citizens, not permitting them to
rest on the seventh day, but forcing them to do all that they usually
did on other days; and to that degree of distress did he reduce them in
this matter, that the rest of the seventh day was dissolved not only at
Antioch, but the same thing which took thence its rise was done in other
cities also, in like manner, for some small time.</p>
        <p>4. Now, after these misfortunes had happened to the Jews at Antioch, a
second calamity befell them, the description of which when we were going
about we premised the account foregoing; for upon this accident, whereby
the four-square market-place was burnt down, as well as the archives,
and the place where the public records were preserved, and the royal
palaces, [and it was not without difficulty that the fire was then put
a stop to, which was likely, by the fury wherewith it was carried along,
to have gone over the whole city,] Antiochus accused the Jews as the
occasion of all the mischief that was done. Now this induced the people
of Antioch, who were now under the immediate persuasion, by reason of
the disorder they were in, that this calumny was true, and would have
been under the same persuasion, even though they had not borne
an ill-will at the Jews before, to believe this man&#x27;s accusation,
especially when they considered what had been done before, and this
to such a degree, that they all fell violently upon those that were
accused, and this, like madmen, in a very furious rage also, even as if
they had seen the Jews in a manner setting fire themselves to the city;
nor was it without difficulty that one Cneius Collegas, the legate,
could prevail with them to permit the affairs to be laid before Caesar;
for as to Cesennius Petus, the president of Syria, Vespasian had already
sent him away; and so it happened that he was not yet come back thither.
But when Collegas had made a careful inquiry into the matter, he found
out the truth, and that not one of those Jews that were accused by
Antiochus had any hand in it, but that all was done by some vile persons
greatly in debt, who supposed that if they could once set fire to the
market-place, and burn the public records, they should have no further
demands made upon them. So the Jews were under great disorder and
terror, in the uncertain expectations of what would be the upshot of
these accusations against them.</p>
        <p>CHAPTER 4.</p>
        <p>How Vespasian Was Received At Rome; As Also How The Germans
     Revolted From The Romans, But Were Subdued. That The
     Sarmatians Overran Mysia, But Were Compelled To Retire To
     Their Own Country Again.</p>
        <p>1. And now Titus Caesar, upon the news that was brought him concerning
his father, that his coming was much desired by all the Italian cities,
and that Rome especially received him with great alacrity and splendor,
betook himself to rejoicing and pleasures to a great degree, as now
freed from the solicitude he had been under, after the most agreeable
manner. For all men that were in Italy showed their respects to him
in their minds before he came thither, as if he were already come, as
esteeming the very expectation they had of him to be his real presence,
on account of the great desires they had to see him, and because the
good-will they bore him was entirely free and unconstrained; for it was,
desirable thing to the senate, who well remembered the calamities they
had undergone in the late changes of their governors, to receive a
governor who was adorned with the gravity of old age, and with the
highest skill in the actions of war, whose advancement would be, as they
knew, for nothing else but for the preservation of those that were to
be governed. Moreover, the people had been so harassed by their civil
miseries, that they were still more earnest for his coming immediately,
as supposing they should then be firmly delivered from their calamities,
and believed they should then recover their secure tranquillity and
prosperity; and for the soldiery, they had the principal regard to him,
for they were chiefly apprized of his great exploits in war; and since
they had experienced the want of skill and want of courage in other
commanders, they were very desirous to be free from that great shame
they had undergone by their means, and heartily wished to receive such
a prince as might be a security and an ornament to them. And as this
good-will to Vespasian was universal, those that enjoyed any remarkable
dignities could not have patience enough to stay in Rome, but made haste
to meet him at a very great distance from it; nay, indeed, none of the
rest could endure the delay of seeing him, but did all pour out of the
city in such crowds, and were so universally possessed with the opinion
that it was easier and better for them to go out than to stay there,
that this was the very first time that the city joyfully perceived
itself almost empty of its citizens; for those that staid within were
fewer than those that went out. But as soon as the news was come that he
was hard by, and those that had met him at first related with what good
humor he received every one that came to him, then it was that the whole
multitude that had remained in the city, with their wives and children,
came into the road, and waited for him there; and for those whom he
passed by, they made all sorts of acclamations, on account of the joy
they had to see him, and the pleasantness of his countenance, and styled
him their Benefactor and Savior, and the only person who was worthy to
be ruler of the city of Rome. And now the city was like a temple, full
of garlands and sweet odors; nor was it easy for him to come to the
royal palace, for the multitude of the people that stood about him,
where yet at last he performed his sacrifices of thanksgiving to his
household gods for his safe return to the city. The multitude did also
betake themselves to feasting; which feasts and drink-offerings they
celebrated by their tribes, and their families, and their neighborhoods,
and still prayed God to grant that Vespasian, his sons, and all their
posterity, might continue in the Roman government for a very long time,
and that his dominion might be preserved from all opposition. And this
was the manner in which Rome so joyfully received Vespasian, and thence
grew immediately into a state of great prosperity.</p>
        <p>2. But before this time, and while Vespasian was about Alexandria, and
Titus was lying at the siege of Jerusalem, a great multitude of the
Germans were in commotion, and tended to rebellion; and as the Gauls in
their neighborhood joined with them, they conspired together, and had
thereby great hopes of success, and that they should free themselves
from the dominion of the Romans. The motives that induced the Germans to
this attempt for a revolt, and for beginning the war, were these: In
the first place, the nature [of the people], which was destitute of just
reasonings, and ready to throw themselves rashly into danger, upon small
hopes; in the next place, the hatred they bore to those that were their
governors, while their nation had never been conscious of subjection
to any but to the Romans, and that by compulsion only. Besides these
motives, it was the opportunity that now offered itself, which above
all the rest prevailed with them so to do; for when they saw the Roman
government in a great internal disorder, by the continual changes of its
rulers, and understood that every part of the habitable earth under them
was in an unsettled and tottering condition, they thought this was
the best opportunity that could afford itself for themselves to make a
sedition, when the state of the Romans was so ill. Classicus 6 also,
and Vitellius, two of their commanders, puffed them up with such hopes.
These had for a long time been openly desirous of such an innovation,
and were induced by the present opportunity to venture upon the
declaration of their sentiments; the multitude was also ready; and when
these men told them of what they intended to attempt, that news was
gladly received by them. So when a great part of the Germans had agreed
to rebel, and the rest were no better disposed, Vespasian, as guided by
Divine Providence, sent letters to Petilius Cerealis, who had formerly
had the command of Germany, whereby he declared him to have the dignity
of consul, and commanded him to take upon him the government of Britain;
so he went whither he was ordered to go, and when he was informed of
the revolt of the Germans, he fell upon them as soon as they were gotten
together, and put his army in battle-array, and slew a great number of
them in the fight, and forced them to leave off their madness, and to
grow wiser; nay, had he not fallen thus suddenly upon them on the
place, it had not been long ere they would however have been brought
to punishment; for as soon as ever the news of their revolt was come to
Rome, and Caesar Domitian was made acquainted with it, he made no delay,
even at that his age, when he was exceeding young, but undertook this
weighty affair. He had a courageous mind from his father, and had
made greater improvements than belonged to such an age: accordingly
he marched against the barbarians immediately; whereupon their hearts
failed them at the very rumor of his approach, and they submitted
themselves to him with fear, and thought it a happy thing that they
were brought under their old yoke again without suffering any further
mischiefs. When therefore Domitian had settled all the affairs of Gaul
in such good order, that it would not be easily put into disorder any
more, he returned to Rome with honor and glory, as having performed such
exploits as were above his own age, but worthy of so great a father.</p>
        <p>3. At the very same time with the forementioned revolt of the Germans
did the bold attempt of the Scythians against the Romans occur; for
those Scythians who are called Sarmatians, being a very numerous
people, transported themselves over the Danube into Mysia, without
being perceived; after which, by their violence, and entirely unexpected
assault, they slew a great many of the Romans that guarded the
frontiers; and as the consular legate Fonteius Agrippa came to meet
them, and fought courageously against them, he was slain by them. They
then overran all the region that had been subject to him, tearing and
rending every thing that fell in their way. But when Vespasian was
informed of what had happened, and how Mysia was laid waste, he sent
away Rubrius Gallus to punish these Sarmatians; by whose means many of
them perished in the battles he fought against them, and that part which
escaped fled with fear to their own country. So when this general
had put an end to the war, he provided for the future security of the
country also; for he placed more and more numerous garrisons in the
place, till he made it altogether impossible for the barbarians to
pass over the river any more. And thus had this war in Mysia a sudden
conclusion.</p>
