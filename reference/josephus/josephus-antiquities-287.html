        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">At this time, when the Assyrians had the dominion over Asia, the people
of Sodom were in a flourishing condition, both as to riches and the
number of their youth. There were five kings that managed the affairs of
this county: Ballas, Barsas, Senabar, and Sumobor, with the king of
Bela; and each king led on his own troops: and the Assyrians made war
upon them; and, dividing their army into four parts, fought against
them. Now every part of the army had its own commander; and when the
battle was joined, the Assyrians were conquerors, and imposed a tribute
on the kings of the Sodomites, who submitted to this slavery twelve
years; and so long they continued to pay their tribute: but on the
thirteenth year they rebelled, and then the army of the Assyrians came
upon them, under their commanders Amraphel, Arioch, Chodorlaomer, and
Tidal. These kings had laid waste all Syria, and overthrown the
offspring of the giants. And when they were come over against Sodom,
they pitched their camp at the vale called the Slime Pits, for at that
time there were pits in that place; but now, upon the destruction of the
city of Sodom, that vale became the Lake Asphaltites, as it is called.
However, concerning this lake we shall speak more presently. Now when
the Sodomites joined battle with the Assyrians, and the fight was very
obstinate, many of them were killed, and the rest were carried captive;
among which captives was Lot, who had come to assist the Sodomites.</p>
