        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 11. How Zachariah Shallum, Menahem Pekahiah And Pekah Took The
Government Over The Israelites; And How Pul And Tiglath-Pileser Made An
Expedition Against The Israelites. How Jotham, The Son Of Uzziah Reigned
Over The Tribe Of Judah; And What Things Nahum Prophesied Against The
Assyrians.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now when Zachariah, the son of Jeroboam, had reigned six months over
Israel, he was slain by the treachery of a certain friend of his, whose
name was Shallum, the son of Jabesh, who took the kingdom afterward, but
kept it no longer than thirty days; for Menahem, the general of his
army, who was at that time in the city Tirzah, and heard of what had
befallen Zachariah, removed thereupon with all his forces to Samaria,
and joining battle with Shallum, slew him; and when he had made himself
king, he went thence, and came to the city Tiphsah; but the citizens
that were in it shut their gates, and barred them against the king, and
would not admit him: but in order to be avenged on them, he burnt the
country round about it, and took the city by force, upon a siege; and
being very much displeased at what the inhabitants of Tiphsah had done,
he slew them all, and spared not so much as the infants, without
omitting the utmost instances of cruelty and barbarity; for he used such
severity upon his own countrymen, as would not be pardonable with regard
to strangers who had been conquered by him. And after this manner it was
that this Menahem 22 continued to reign with cruelty and barbarity for
ten years. But when Pul, king of Assyria, had made an expedition against
him, he did not think meet to fight or engage in battle with the
Assyrians, but he persuaded him to accept of a thousand talents of
silver, and to go away, and so put an end to the war. This sum the
multitude collected for Menahem, by exacting fifty drachmae as poll-
money for every head; 23 after which he died, and was buried in Samaria,
and left his son Pekahiah his successor in the kingdom, who followed the
barbarity of his father, and so ruled but two years only, after which he
was slain with his friends at a feast, by the treachery of one Pekah,
the general of his horse, and the son of Remaliah, who laid snares for
him. Now this Pekah held the government twenty years, and proved a
wicked man and a transgressor. But the king of Assyria, whose name was
Tiglath-Pileser, when he had made an expedition against the Israelites,
and had overrun all the land of Gilead, and the region beyond Jordan,
and the adjoining country, which is called Galilee, and Kadesh, and
Hazor, he made the inhabitants prisoners, and transplanted them into his
own kingdom. And so much shall suffice to have related here concerning
the king of Assyria.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. Now Jotham the son of Uzziah reigned over the tribe of Judah in
Jerusalem, being a citizen thereof by his mother, whose name was
Jerusha. This king was not defective in any virtue, but was religious
towards God, and righteous towards men, and careful of the good of the
city [for what part soever wanted to be repaired or adorned he
magnificently repaired and adorned them]. He also took care of the
foundations of the cloisters in the temple, and repaired the walls that
were fallen down, and built very great towers, and such as were almost
impregnable; and if any thing else in his kingdom had been neglected, he
took great care of it. He also made an expedition against the Ammonites,
and overcame them in battle, and ordered them to pay tribute, a hundred
talents, and ten thousand cori of wheat, and as many of barley, every
year, and so augmented his kingdom, that his enemies could not despise
it, and his own people lived happily.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. Now there was at that time a prophet, whose name was Nahum, who spake
after this manner concerning the overthrow of the Assyrians and of
Nineveh: &quot;Nineveh shall be a pool of water in motion so shall all her
people be troubled, and tossed, and go away by flight, while they say
one to another, Stand, stand still, seize their gold and silver, for
there shall be no one to wish them well, for they will rather save their
lives than their money; for a terrible contention shall possess them one
with another, and lamentation, and loosing of the members, and their
countenances shall be perfectly black with fear. And there will be the
den of the lions, and the mother of the young lions! God says to thee,
Nineveh, that they shall deface thee, and the lion shall no longer go
out from thee to give laws to the world.&quot; And indeed this prophet
prophesied many other things besides these concerning Nineveh, which I
do not think necessary to repeat, and I here omit them, that I may not
appear troublesome to my readers; all which thing happened about Nineveh
a hundred and fifteen years afterward: so this may suffice to have
spoken of these matters.</p>
