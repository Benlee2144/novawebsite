        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">How Joppa Was Taken, And Tiberias Delivered Up.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now Vespasian returned to Ptolemais on the fourth day of the month
Panemus, [Tamus] and from thence he came to Cesarea, which lay by the
sea-side. This was a very great city of Judea, and for the greatest part
inhabited by Greeks: the citizens here received both the Roman army and
its general, with all sorts of acclamations and rejoicings, and this
partly out of the good-will they bore to the Romans, but principally out
of the hatred they bore to those that were conquered by them; on which
account they came clamoring against Josephus in crowds, and desired
he might be put to death. But Vespasian passed over this petition
concerning him, as offered by the injudicious multitude, with a bare
silence. Two of the legions also he placed at Cesarea, that they might
there take their winter-quarters, as perceiving the city very fit for
such a purpose; but he placed the tenth and the fifth at Scythopolis,
that he might not distress Cesarea with the entire army. This place was
warm even in winter, as it was suffocating hot in the summer time, by
reason of its situation in a plain, and near to the sea [of Galilee].</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. In the mean time, there were gathered together as well such as had
seditiously got out from among their enemies, as those that had escaped
out of the demolished cities, which were in all a great number, and
repaired Joppa, which had been left desolate by Cestius, that it might
serve them for a place of refuge; and because the adjoining region had
been laid waste in the war, and was not capable of supporting them, they
determined to go off to sea. They also built themselves a great many
piratical ships, and turned pirates upon the seas near to Syria, and
Phoenicia, and Egypt, and made those seas unnavigable to all men. Now
as soon as Vespasian knew of their conspiracy, he sent both footmen and
horsemen to Joppa, which was unguarded in the night time; however, those
that were in it perceived that they should be attacked, and were afraid
of it; yet did they not endeavor to keep the Romans out, but fled to
their ships, and lay at sea all night, out of the reach of their darts.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. Now Joppa is not naturally a haven, for it ends in a rough shore,
where all the rest of it is straight, but the two ends bend towards each
other, where there are deep precipices, and great stones that jut out
into the sea, and where the chains wherewith Andromeda was bound have
left their footsteps, which attest to the antiquity of that fable. But
the north wind opposes and beats upon the shore, and dashes mighty
waves against the rocks which receive them, and renders the haven more
dangerous than the country they had deserted. Now as those people of
Joppa were floating about in this sea, in the morning there fell a
violent wind upon them; it is called by those that sail there &quot;the
black north wind,&quot; and there dashed their ships one against another,
and dashed some of them against the rocks, and carried many of them by
force, while they strove against the opposite waves, into the main sea;
for the shore was so rocky, and had so many of the enemy upon it, that
they were afraid to come to land; nay, the waves rose so very high, that
they drowned them; nor was there any place whither they could fly, nor
any way to save themselves; while they were thrust out of the sea, by
the violence of the wind, if they staid where they were, and out of the
city by the violence of the Romans. And much lamentation there was when
the ships were dashed against one another, and a terrible noise when
they were broken to pieces; and some of the multitude that were in
them were covered with waves, and so perished, and a great many were
embarrassed with shipwrecks. But some of them thought that to die
by their own swords was lighter than by the sea, and so they killed
themselves before they were drowned; although the greatest part of them
were carried by the waves, and dashed to pieces against the abrupt
parts of the rocks, insomuch that the sea was bloody a long way, and the
maritime parts were full of dead bodies; for the Romans came upon those
that were carried to the shore, and destroyed them; and the number of
the bodies that were thus thrown out of the sea was four thousand and
two hundred. The Romans also took the city without opposition, and
utterly demolished it.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. And thus was Joppa taken twice by the Romans in a little time; but
Vespasian, in order to prevent these pirates from coming thither any
more, erected a camp there, where the citadel of Joppa had been, and
left a body of horse in it, with a few footmen, that these last might
stay there and guard the camp, and the horsemen might spoil the country
that lay round it, and might destroy the neighboring villages and
smaller cities. So these troops overran the country, as they were
ordered to do, and every day cut to pieces and laid desolate the whole
region.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">5. But now, when the fate of Jotapata was related at Jerusalem, a great
many at the first disbelieved it, on account of the vastness of the
calamity, and because they had no eye-witness to attest the truth
of what was related about it; for not one person was saved to be a
messenger of that news, but a fame was spread abroad at random that the
city was taken, as such fame usually spreads bad news about. However,
the truth was known by degrees, from the places near Jotapata, and
appeared to all to be too true. Yet were there fictitious stories added
to what was really done; for it was reported that Josephus was slain
at the taking of the city, which piece of news filled Jerusalem full of
sorrow. In every house also, and among all to whom any of the slain
were allied, there was a lamentation for them; but the mourning for the
commander was a public one; and some mourned for those that had lived
with them, others for their kindred, others for their friends, and
others for their brethren, but all mourned for Josephus; insomuch that
the lamentation did not cease in the city before the thirtieth day;
and a great many hired mourners, with their pipes, who should begin the
melancholy ditties for them.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">6. But as the truth came out in time, it appeared how the affairs of
Jotapata really stood; yet was it found that the death of Josephus was
a fiction; and when they understood that he was alive, and was among the
Romans, and that the commanders treated him at another rate than they
treated captives, they were as vehemently angry at him now as they had
showed their good-will before, when he appeared to have been dead. He
was also abused by some as having been a coward, and by others as a
deserter; and the city was full of indignation at him, and of reproaches
cast upon him; their rage was also aggravated by their afflictions, and
more inflamed by their ill success; and what usually becomes an occasion
of caution to wise men, I mean affliction, became a spur to them to
venture on further calamities, and the end of one misery became still
the beginning of another; they therefore resolved to fall on the Romans
the more vehemently, as resolving to be revenged on him in revenging
themselves on the Romans. And this was the state of Jerusalem as to the
troubles which now came upon it.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">7. But Vespasian, in order to see the kingdom of Agrippa, while the king
persuaded himself so to do, [partly in order to his treating the general
and his army in the best and most splendid manner his private affairs
would enable him to do, and partly that he might, by their means,
correct such things as were amiss in his government,] he removed from
that Cesarea which was by the sea-side, and went to that which is called
Cesarea Philippi 6 and there he refreshed his army for twenty days,
and was himself feasted by king Agrippa, where he also returned public
thanks to God for the good success he had had in his undertakings. But
as soon as he was informed that Tiberias was fond of innovations, and
that Taricheae had revolted, both which cities were parts of the kingdom
of Agrippa, and was satisfied within himself that the Jews were every
where perverted [from their obedience to their governors], he thought it
seasonable to make an expedition against these cities, and that for the
sake of Agrippa, and in order to bring his cities to reason. So he sent
away his son Titus to [the other] Cesarea, that he might bring the army
that lay there to Seythopous, which is the largest city of Decapolis,
and in the neighborhood of Tiberias, whither he came, and where he
waited for his son. He then came with three legions, and pitched his
camp thirty furlongs off Tiberias, at a certain station easily seen
by the innovators; it is named Sennabris. He also sent Valerian, a
decurion, with fifty horsemen, to speak peaceably to those that were in
the city, and to exhort them to give him assurances of their fidelity;
for he had heard that the people were desirous of peace, but were
obliged by some of the seditious part to join with them, and so were
forced to fight for them. When Valerian had marched up to the place, and
was near the wall, he alighted off his horse, and made those that were
with him to do the same, that they might not be thought to come to
skirmish with them; but before they could come to a discourse one with
another, the most potent men among the seditious made a sally upon them
armed; their leader was one whose name was Jesus, the son of Shaphat,
the principal head of a band of robbers. Now Valerian, neither thinking
it safe to fight contrary to the commands of the general, though he
were secure of a victory, and knowing that it was a very hazardous
undertaking for a few to fight with many, for those that were unprovided
to fight those that were ready, and being on other accounts surprised at
this unexpected onset of the Jews, he ran away on foot, as did five of
the rest in like manner, and left their horses behind them; which horses
Jesus led away into the city, and rejoiced as if they had taken them in
battle, and not by treachery.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">8. Now the seniors of the people, and such as were of principal
authority among them, fearing what would be the issue of this matter,
fled to the camp of the Romans; they then took their king along with
them, and fell down before Vespasian, to supplicate his favor, and
besought him not to overlook them, nor to impute the madness of a few to
the whole city, to spare a people that have been ever civil and
obliging to the Romans; but to bring the authors of this revolt to due
punishment, who had hitherto so watched them, that though they were
zealous to give them the security of their right hands of a long time,
yet could they not accomplish the same. With these supplications the
general complied, although he were very angry at the whole city about
the carrying off his horses, and this because he saw that Agrippa
was under a great concern for them. So when Vespasian and Agrippa had
accepted of their right hands by way of security, Jesus and his party
thought it not safe for them to continue at Tiberias, so they ran
away to Taricheae. The next day Vespasian sent Trajan before with some
horsemen to the citadel, to make trial of the multitude, whether they
were all disposed for peace; and as soon as he knew that the people were
of the same mind with the petitioner, he took his army, and went to the
city; upon which the citizens opened to him their gates, and met him
with acclamations of joy, and called him their savior and benefactor.
But as the army was a great while in getting in at the gates, they were
so narrow, Vespasian commanded the south wall to be broken down, and
so made a broad passage for their entrance. However, he charged them to
abstain from rapine and injustice, in order to gratify the king; and on
his account spared the rest of the wall, while the king undertook for
them that they should continue [faithful to the Romans] for the time to
come. And thus did he restore this city to a quiet state, after it had
been grievously afflicted by the sedition.</p>
