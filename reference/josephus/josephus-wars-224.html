        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 11.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">Concerning Jonathan, One Of The Sicarii, That Stirred Up A
     Sedition In Cyrene, And Was A False Accuser [Of The
     Innocent].</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. And now did the madness of the Sicarii, like a disease, reach as far
as the cities of Cyrene; for one Jonathan, a vile person, and by trade
a weaver, came thither and prevailed with no small number of the
poorer sort to give ear to him; he also led them into the desert, upon
promising them that he would show them signs and apparitions. And as for
the other Jews of Cyrene, he concealed his knavery from them, and put
tricks upon them; but those of the greatest dignity among them informed
Catullus, the governor of the Libyan Pentapolis, of his march into the
desert, and of the preparations he had made for it. So he sent out after
him both horsemen and footmen, and easily overcame them, because they
were unarmed men; of these many were slain in the fight, but some were
taken alive, and brought to Catullus. As for Jonathan, the head of this
plot, he fled away at that time; but upon a great and very diligent
search, which was made all the country over for him, he was at last
taken. And when he was brought to Catullus, he devised a way whereby he
both escaped punishment himself, and afforded an occasion to Catullus
of doing much mischief; for he falsely accused the richest men among the
Jews, and said that they had put him upon what he did.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. Now Catullus easily admitted of these his calumnies, and aggravated
matters greatly, and made tragical exclamations, that he might also be
supposed to have had a hand in the finishing of the Jewish war. But what
was still harder, he did not only give a too easy belief to his stories,
but he taught the Sicarii to accuse men falsely. He bid this Jonathan,
therefore, to name one Alexander, a Jew [with whom he had formerly had
a quarrel, and openly professed that he hated him]; he also got him to
name his wife Bernice, as concerned with him. These two Catullus ordered
to be slain in the first place; nay, after them he caused all the rich
and wealthy Jews to be slain, being no fewer in all than three thousand.
This he thought he might do safely, because he confiscated their
effects, and added them to Caesar&#x27;s revenues.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. Nay, indeed, lest any Jews that lived elsewhere should convict him of
his villainy, he extended his false accusations further, and persuaded
Jonathan, and certain others that were caught with him, to bring an
accusation of attempts for innovation against the Jews that were of the
best character both at Alexandria and at Rome. One of these, against
whom this treacherous accusation was laid, was Josephus, the writer of
these books. However, this plot, thus contrived by Catullus, did not
succeed according to his hopes; for though he came himself to Rome, and
brought Jonathan and his companions along with him in bonds, and thought
he should have had no further inquisition made as to those lies that
were forged under his government, or by his means; yet did Vespasian
suspect the matter and made an inquiry how far it was true. And when he
understood that the accusation laid against the Jews was an unjust one,
he cleared them of the crimes charged upon them, and this on account of
Titus&#x27;s concern about the matter, and brought a deserved punishment upon
Jonathan; for he was first tormented, and then burnt alive.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. But as to Catullus, the emperors were so gentle to him, that he
underwent no severe condemnation at this time; yet was it not long
before he fell into a complicated and almost incurable distemper, and
died miserably. He was not only afflicted in body, but the distemper
in his mind was more heavy upon him than the other; for he was terribly
disturbed, and continually cried out that he saw the ghosts of those
whom he had slain standing before him. Where upon he was not able to
contain himself, but leaped out of his bed, as if both torments and fire
were brought to him. This his distemper grew still a great deal worse
and worse continually, and his very entrails were so corroded, that they
fell out of his body, and in that condition he died. Thus he became as
great an instance of Divine Providence as ever was, and demonstrated
that God punishes wicked men.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">5. And here we shall put an end to this our history; wherein we formerly
promised to deliver the same with all accuracy, to such as should be
desirous of understanding after what manner this war of the Romans with
the Jews was managed. Of which history, how good the style is, must be
left to the determination of the readers; but as for its agreement with
the facts, I shall not scruple to say, and that boldly, that truth hath
been what I have alone aimed at through its entire composition.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">WAR BOOK 7 FOOTNOTES 2 (return) [ This Tereutius Rufus, as Reland in
part observes here, is the same person whom the Talmudists call Turnus
Rufus; of whom they relate, that &quot;he ploughed up Sion as a field, and
made Jerusalem become as heaps, and the mountain of the house as the
high Idaces of a forest;&quot; which was long before foretold by the prophet
Micah, ch. 3:12, and quoted from him in the prophecies of Jeremiah, ch.
26:18.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3 (return) [ See Ecclesiastes 8:11.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4 (return) [ This Berytus was certainly a Roman colony, and has coins
extant that witness the same, as Hudson and Spanheim inform us. See the
note on Antiq. B. XVI: ch. 11. sect. 1.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">5 (return) [ The Jews at Antioch and Alexandria, the two principal
cities in all the East, had allowed them, both by the Macedonians, and
afterwards by the Romans, a governor of their own, who was exempt from
the jurisdiction of the other civil governors. He was called sometimes
barely &quot;governor,&quot; sometimes &quot;ethnarch,&quot; and [at Alexandria] &quot;alabarch,&quot;
as Dr. Hudson takes notice on this place out of Fuller&#x27;s Miscellanies.
They had the like governor or governors allowed them at Babylon under
their captivity there, as the history of Susanna implies.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">6 (return) [ This Classicus, and Civilis, and Cerealis are names well
known in Tacitus; the two former as moving sedition against the Romans,
and the last as sent to repress them by Vespasian, just as they are here
described in Josephus; which is the case also of Fontellis Agrippa
and Rubrius Gallup, i, sect. 3. But as to the very favorable account
presently given of Domitian, particularly as to his designs in this his
Gallic and German expedition, it is not a little contrary to that in
Suetonius, Vesp. sect. 7. Nor are the reasons unobvious that might
occasion this great diversity: Domitian was one of Josephus&#x27;s patrons,
and when he published these books of the Jewish war, was very young, and
had hardly begun those wicked practices which rendered him so infamous
afterward; while Suetonius seems to have been too young, and too low
in life, to receive any remarkable favors from him; as Domitian was
certainly very lewd and cruel, and generally hated, when Suetonius wrote
about him.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">7 (return) [ Since in these latter ages this Sabbatic River, once so
famous, which, by Josephus&#x27;s account here, ran every seventh day,
and rested on six, but according to Pliny, Nat. Hist. 31. II, ran
perpetually on six days, and rested every seventh, [though it no way
appears by either of their accounts that the seventh day of this river
was the Jewish seventh day or sabbath,] is quite vanished, I shall add
no more about it: only see Dr. Hudson&#x27;s note. In Varenius&#x27;s Geography,
i, 17, the reader will find several instances of such periodical
fountains and rivers, though none of their periods were that of a just
week as of old this appears to have been.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">8 (return) [ Vespasian and his two sons, Titus and Domitian.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">9 (return) [ See the representations of these Jewish vessels as they
still stand on Titus&#x27;s triumphal arch at Rome, in Reland&#x27;s very curious
book de Spoliis Ternpli, throughout. But what, things are chiefly to be
noted are these: [1.] That Josephus says the candlestick here carried in
this triumph was not thoroughly like that which was used in the temple,
which appears in the number of the little knobs and flowers in that on
the triumphal arch not well agreeing with Moses&#x27;s description, Exodus
25:31-36. [2.] The smallness of the branches in Josephus compared with
the thickness of those on that arch. [3.] That the Law or Pentateuch
does not appear on that arch at all, though Josephus, an eye-witness,
assures us that it was carried in this procession. All which things
deserve the consideration of the inquisitive reader.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">10 (return) [ Spanheim observes here, that in Graceia Major and
Sicily they had rue prodigiously great and durable, like this rue at
Machaerus.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">11 (return) [ This strange account of the place and root Baaras seems to
have been taken from the magicians, and the root to have been made use
of in the days of Josephus, in that superstitious way of casting out
demons, supposed by him to have been derived from king Solomon; of which
we have already seen he had a great opinion, Antiq. B. VIII. ch. 2.
sect. 5. We also may hence learn the true notion Josephus had of demons
and demoniacs, exactly like that of the Jews and Christians in the New
Testament, and the first four centuries. See Antiq. B. I. ch. 8. sect.
2; B. XI, ch. 2. sect. 3.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">12 (return) [ It is very remarkable that Titus did not people this now
desolate country of Judea, but ordered it to be all sold; nor indeed is
it properly peopled at this day, but lies ready for its old inhabitants
the Jews, at their future restoration. See Literal Accomplishment of
Prophecies, p. 77.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">13 (return) [ That the city Emmaus, or Areindus, in Josephus and others
which was the place of the government of Julius Africanus were slain,
to the number of one thousand seven hundred, as were the women and the
children made slaves. But as Bassus thought he must perform the covenant
he had made with those that had surrendered the citadel, he let them go,
and restored Eleazar to them, in the beginning of the third century, and
which he then procured to be rebuilt, and after which rebuilding it
was called Nicopolis, is entirely different from that Emmaus which is
mentioned by St. Luke 24;13; see Reland&#x27;s Paleestina, lib. II. p. 429,
and under the name Ammaus also. But he justly thinks that that in St.
Luke may well be the same with his Ammaus before us, especially since
the Greek copies here usually make it sixty furlongs distant from
Jerusalem, as does St. Luke, though the Latin copies say only thirty.
The place also allotted for these eight hundred soldiers, as for a Roman
garrison, in this place, would most naturally be not so remote from
Jerusalem as was the other Emmaus, or Nicopolis.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">14 (return) [ Pliny and others confirm this strange paradox, that
provisions laid up against sieges will continue good for a hundred
years, as Spanheim notes upon this place.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">15 (return) [ The speeches in this and the next section, as introduced
under the person of this Eleazar, are exceeding remarkable, and of the
noblest subjects, the contempt of death, and the dignity and immortality
of the soul; and that not only among the Jews, but among the Indians
themselves also; and are highly worthy the perusal of all the curious.
It seems as if that philosophic lady who survived, ch. 9. sect. 1, 2,
remembered the substance of these discourses, as spoken by Eleazar, and
so Josephus clothed them in his own words: at the lowest they contain
the Jewish notions on these heads, as understood then by our Josephus,
and cannot but deserve a suitable regard from us.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">16 (return) [ See B. II. ch. 20. sect. 2, where the number of the slain
is but 10,000.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">17 (return) [ Reland here sets down a parallel aphorism of one of
the Jewish Rabbins, &quot;We are born that we may die, and die that we may
live.&quot;]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">18 (return) [ Since Josephus here informs us that some of these Sicarii,
or ruffians, went from Alexandria [which was itself in Egypt, in a large
sense] into Egypt, and Thebes there situated, Reland well observes, from
Vossius, that Egypt sometimes denotes Proper or Upper Egypt, as distinct
from the Delta, and the lower parts near Palestine. Accordingly, as he
adds, those that say it never rains in Egypt must mean the Proper or
Upper Egypt, because it does sometimes rain in the other parts. See the
note on Antiq. B. II. ch. 7. sect. 7, and B. III. ch. 1. sect. 6.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">19 (return) [ Of this temple of Onias&#x27;s building in Egypt, see the notes
on Antiq. B. XIII. ch. 3. sect. 1. But whereas it is elsewhere, both
of the War, B. I. ch. 1. sect. 1, and in the Antiquities as now quoted,
said that this temple was like to that at Jerusalem, and here that it
was not like it, but like a tower, sect. 3, there is some reason to
suspect the reading here, and that either the negative particle is here
to be blotted out, or the word entirely added.]</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">20 (return) [ We must observe, that Josephus here speaks of Antiochus
who profaned the temple as now alive, when Onias had leave given them
by Philometer to build his temple; whereas it seems not to have been
actually built till about fifteen years afterwards. Yet, because it is
said in the Antiquities that Onias went to Philometer, B. XII. ch.
9. sect. 7, during the lifetime of that Antiochus, it is probable he
petitioned, and perhaps obtained his leave then, though it were not
actually built or finished till fifteen years afterward.]</p>
