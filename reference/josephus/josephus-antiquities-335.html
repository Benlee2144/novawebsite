        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 1. Fight Of The Hebrews With The Canaanites Without The Consent
Of Moses; And Their Defeat.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now this life of the Hebrews in the wilderness was so disagreeable
and troublesome to them, and they were so uneasy at it, that although
God had forbidden them to meddle with the Canaanites, yet could they not
be persuaded to be obedient to the words of Moses, and to be quiet; but
supposing they should be able to beat their enemies, without his
approbation, they accused him, and suspected that he made it his
business to keep them in a distressed condition, that they might always
stand in need of his assistance. Accordingly they resolved to fight with
the Canaanites, and said that God gave them his assistance, not out of
regard to Moses&#x27;s intercessions, but because he took care of their
entire nation, on account of their forefathers, whose affairs he took
under his own conduct; as also, that it was on account of their own
virtue that he had formerly procured them their liberty, and would be
assisting to them, now they were willing to take pains for it. They also
said that they were possessed of abilities sufficient for the conquest
of their enemies, although Moses should have a mind to alienate God from
them; that, however, it was for their advantage to be their own masters,
and not so far to rejoice in their deliverance from the indignities they
endured under the Egyptians, as to bear the tyranny of Moses over them,
and to suffer themselves to be deluded, and live according to his
pleasure, as though God did only foretell what concerns us out of his
kindness to him, as if they were not all the posterity of Abraham; that
God made him alone the author of all the knowledge we have, and we must
still learn it from him; that it would be a piece of prudence to oppose
his arrogant pretenses, and to put their confidence in God, and to
resolve to take possession of that land which he had promised them, and
not to give ear to him, who on this account, and under the pretense of
Divine authority, forbade them so to do. Considering, therefore, the
distressed state they were in at present, and that in those desert
places they were still to expect things would be worse with them, they
resolved to fight with the Canaanites, as submitting only to God, their
supreme Commander, and not waiting for any assistance from their
legislator.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. When, therefore, they had come to this resolution, as being best for
them, they went against their enemies; but those enemies were not
dismayed either at the attack itself, or at the great multitude that
made it, and received them with great courage. Many of the Hebrews were
slain; and the remainder of the army, upon the disorder of their troops,
were pursued, and fled, after a shameful manner, to their camp.
Whereupon this unexpected misfortune made them quite despond; and they
hoped for nothing that was good; as gathering from it, that this
affliction came from the wrath of God, because they rashly went out to
war without his approbation.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. But when Moses saw how deeply they were affected with this defeat,
and being afraid lest the enemies should grow insolent upon this
victory, and should be desirous of gaining still greater glory, and
should attack them, he resolved that it was proper to withdraw the army
into the wilderness to a further distance from the Canaanites: so the
multitude gave themselves up again to his conduct, for they were
sensible that, without his care for them, their affairs could not be in
a good condition; and he caused the host to remove, and he went further
into the wilderness, as intending there to let them rest, and not to
permit them to fight the Canaanites before God should afford them a more
favorable opportunity.</p>
