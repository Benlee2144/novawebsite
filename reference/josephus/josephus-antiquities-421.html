        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 3. How Joram And Jehoshaphat Made An Expedition Against The
Moabites; As Also Concerning The Wonders Of Elisha; And The Death Of
Jehoshaphat.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. When Joram had taken upon him the kingdom, he determined to make an
expedition against the king of Moab, whose name was Mesha; for, as we
told you before, he was departed from his obedience to his brother
[Ahaziah], while he paid to his father Ahab two hundred thousand sheep,
with their fleeces of wool. When therefore he had gathered his own army
together, he sent also to Jehoshaphat, and entreated him, that since he
had from the beginning been a friend to his father, he would assist him
in the war that he was entering into against the Moabites, who had
departed from their obedience, who not only himself promised to assist
him, but would also oblige the king of Edom, who was under his
authority, to make the same expedition also. When Joram had received
these assurances of assistance from Jehoshaphat, he took his army with
him, and came to Jerusalem; and when he had been sumptuously entertained
by the king of Jerusalem, it was resolved upon by them to take their
march against their enemies through the wilderness of Edom. And when
they had taken a compass of seven days&#x27; journey, they were in distress
for want of water for the cattle, and for the army, from the mistake of
their roads by the guides that conducted them, insomuch that they were
all in an agony, especially Joram; and cried to God, by reason of their
sorrow, and [desired to know] what wickedness had been committed by them
that induced him to deliver three kings together, without fighting, unto
the king of Moab. But Jehoshaphat, who was a righteous man, encouraged
him, and bade him send to the camp, and know whether any prophet of God
was come along with them, that we might by him learn from God what we
should do. And when one of the servants of Joram said that he had seen
there Elisha, the son of Shaphat, the disciple of Elijah, the three
kings went to him, at the entreaty of Jehoshaphat; and when they were
come at the prophet&#x27;s tent, which tent was pitched out of the camp, they
asked him what would become of the army? and Joram was particularly very
pressing with him about it. And when he replied to him, that he should
not trouble him, but go to his father&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s prophets, for they
[to be sure] were true prophets, he still desired him to prophesy, and
to save them. So he swore by God that he would not answer him, unless it
were on account of Jehoshaphat, who was a holy and righteous man; and
when, at his desire, they brought him a man that could play on the
psaltery, the Divine Spirit came upon him as the music played, and he
commanded them to dig many trenches in the valley; for, said he, &quot;though
there appear neither cloud, nor wind, nor storm of rain, ye shall see
this river full of water, till the army and the cattle be saved for you
by drinking of it. Nor will this be all the favor that you shall receive
from God, but you shall also overcome your enemies, and take the best
and strongest cities of the Moabites, and you shall cut down their fruit
trees, 6 and lay waste their country, and stop up their fountains and
rivers.&quot;</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. When the prophet had said this, the next day, before the sun-rising,
a great torrent ran strongly; for God had caused it to rain very
plentifully at the distance of three days&#x27; journey into Edom, so that
the army and the cattle found water to drink in abundance. But when the
Moabites heard that the three kings were coming upon them, and made
their approach through the wilderness, the king of Moab gathered his
army together presently, and commanded them to pitch their camp upon the
mountains, that when the enemies should attempt to enter their country,
they might not be concealed from them. But when at the rising of the sun
they saw the water in the torrent, for it was not far from the land of
Moab, and that it was of the color of blood, for at such a time the
water especially looks red, by the shining of the sun upon it, they
formed a false notion of the state of their enemies, as if they had
slain one another for thirst; and that the river ran with their blood.
However, supposing that this was the case, they desired their king would
send them out to spoil their enemies; whereupon they all went in haste,
as to an advantage already gained, and came to the enemy&#x27;s camp, as
supposing them destroyed already. But their hope deceived them; for as
their enemies stood round about them, some of them were cut to pieces,
and others of them were dispersed, and fled to their own country. And
when the kings fell into the land of Moab, they overthrew the cities
that were in it, and spoiled their fields, and marred them, filling them
with stones out of the brooks, and cut down the best of their trees, and
stopped up their fountains of water, and overthrew their walls to their
foundations. But the king of Moab, when he was pursued, endured a siege;
and seeing his city in danger of being overthrown by force, made a
sally, and went out with seven hundred men, in order to break through
the enemy&#x27;s camp with his horsemen, on that side where the watch seemed
to be kept most negligently; and when, upon trial, he could not get
away, for he lighted upon a place that was carefully watched, he
returned into the city, and did a thing that showed despair and the
utmost distress; for he took his eldest son, who was to reign after him,
and lifting him up upon the wall, that he might be visible to all the
enemies, he offered him as a whole burnt-offering to God, whom, when the
kings saw, they commiserated the distress that was the occasion of it,
and were so affected, in way of humanity and pity, that they raised the
siege, and every one returned to his own house. So Jehoshaphat came to
Jerusalem, and continued in peace there, and outlived this expedition
but a little time, and then died, having lived in all sixty years, and
of them reigned twenty-five. He was buried in a magnificent manner in
Jerusalem, for he had imitated the actions of David.</p>
