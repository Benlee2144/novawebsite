        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. After this they were dispersed abroad, on account of their languages,
and went out by colonies every where; and each colony took possession of
that land which they light upon, and unto which God led them; so that
the whole continent was filled with them, both the inland and the
maritime countries. There were some also who passed over the sea in
ships, and inhabited the islands: and some of those nations do still
retain the denominations which were given them by their first founders;
but some have lost them also, and some have only admitted certain
changes in them, that they might be the more intelligible to the
inhabitants. And they were the Greeks who became the authors of such
mutations. For when in after-ages they grew potent, they claimed to
themselves the glory of antiquity; giving names to the nations that
sounded well [in Greek] that they might be better understood among
themselves; and setting agreeable forms of government over them, as if
they were a people derived from themselves.</p>
