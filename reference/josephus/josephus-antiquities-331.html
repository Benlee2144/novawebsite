The Borders Of The Canaanites.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">A Little while afterwards he rose up, and went from Mount Sinai; and,
having passed through several mansions, of which we will speak he came
to a place called Hazeroth, where the multitude began again to be
mutinous, and to Moses for the misfortunes they had suffered their
travels; and that when he had persuaded to leave a good land, they at
once had lost land, and instead of that happy state he had them, they
were still wandering in their miserable condition, being already in want
of water; and if the manna should happen to fail, must then utterly
perish. Yet while they spake many and sore things against the there was
one of them who exhorted them to be unmindful of Moses, and of what
great pains he had been at about their common safety; not to despair of
assistance from God. The multitude thereupon became still more unruly,
and mutinous against Moses than before. Hereupon Moses, although he was
so basely abused by them encouraged them in their despairing conditioned
and promised that he would procure them a quantity of flesh-meat, and
that not for a few days only, but for many days. This they were not to
believe; and when one of them asked, whence he could obtain such vast
plenty of what he promised, he replied, &quot;Neither God nor I, we hear such
opprobrious language from will leave off our labors for you; and this
soon appear also.&quot; As soon as ever he had said this, the whole camp was
filled with quails, they stood round about them, and gathered great
numbers. However, it was not long ere God punished the Hebrews for their
insolence, those reproaches they had used towards him, no small number
of them died; and still to this day the place retains the memory of this
destruction and is named Kibrothhattaavah, which is, Graves of Lust.</p>
