        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">How The People That Were In The Fortress Were Prevailed On
     By The Words Of Eleazar, Two Women And Five Children Only
     Excepted And All Submitted To Be Killed By One Another.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now as Eleazar was proceeding on in this exhortation, they all
cut him off short, and made haste to do the work, as full of an
unconquerable ardor of mind, and moved with a demoniacal fury. So they
went their ways, as one still endeavoring to be before another, and as
thinking that this eagerness would be a demonstration of their courage
and good conduct, if they could avoid appearing in the last class; so
great was the zeal they were in to slay their wives and children, and
themselves also! Nor indeed, when they came to the work itself, did
their courage fail them, as one might imagine it would have done, but
they then held fast the same resolution, without wavering, which they
had upon the hearing of Eleazar&#x27;s speech, while yet every one of them
still retained the natural passion of love to themselves and their
families, because the reasoning they went upon appeared to them to be
very just, even with regard to those that were dearest to them; for the
husbands tenderly embraced their wives, and took their children into
their arms, and gave the longest parting kisses to them, with tears
in their eyes. Yet at the same time did they complete what they had
resolved on, as if they had been executed by the hands of strangers; and
they had nothing else for their comfort but the necessity they were in
of doing this execution, to avoid that prospect they had of the miseries
they were to suffer from their enemies. Nor was there at length any
one of these men found that scrupled to act their part in this terrible
execution, but every one of them despatched his dearest relations.
Miserable men indeed were they! whose distress forced them to slay their
own wives and children with their own hands, as the lightest of those
evils that were before them. So they being not able to bear the grief
they were under for what they had done any longer, and esteeming it an
injury to those they had slain, to live even the shortest space of time
after them, they presently laid all they had upon a heap, and set fire
to it. They then chose ten men by lot out of them to slay all the rest;
every one of whom laid himself down by his wife and children on the
ground, and threw his arms about them, and they offered their necks to
the stroke of those who by lot executed that melancholy office; and when
these ten had, without fear, slain them all, they made the same rule for
casting lots for themselves, that he whose lot it was should first kill
the other nine, and after all should kill himself. Accordingly, all
these had courage sufficient to be no way behind one another in doing
or suffering; so, for a conclusion, the nine offered their necks to the
executioner, and he who was the last of all took a view of all the
other bodies, lest perchance some or other among so many that were slain
should want his assistance to be quite despatched, and when he perceived
that they were all slain, he set fire to the palace, and with the great
force of his hand ran his sword entirely through himself, and fell
down dead near to his own relations. So these people died with this
intention, that they would not leave so much as one soul among them all
alive to be subject to the Romans. Yet was there an ancient woman,
and another who was of kin to Eleazar, and superior to most women in
prudence and learning, with five children, who had concealed themselves
in caverns under ground, and had carried water thither for their drink,
and were hidden there when the rest were intent upon the slaughter of
one another. Those others were nine hundred and sixty in number, the
women and children being withal included in that computation. This
calamitous slaughter was made on the fifteenth day of the month
Xanthicus [Nisan].</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. Now for the Romans, they expected that they should be fought in the
morning, when, accordingly, they put on their armor, and laid bridges of
planks upon their ladders from their banks, to make an assault upon the
fortress, which they did; but saw nobody as an enemy, but a terrible
solitude on every side, with a fire within the place, as well as a
perfect silence. So they were at a loss to guess at what had happened.
At length they made a shout, as if it had been at a blow given by the
battering ram, to try whether they could bring any one out that was
within; the women heard this noise, and came out of their under-ground
cavern, and informed the Romans what had been done, as it was done; and
the second of them clearly described all both what was said and what
was done, and this manner of it; yet did they not easily give their
attention to such a desperate undertaking, and did not believe it could
be as they said; they also attempted to put the fire out, and quickly
cutting themselves a way through it, they came within the palace, and so
met with the multitude of the slain, but could take no pleasure in the
fact, though it were done to their enemies. Nor could they do other than
wonder at the courage of their resolution, and the immovable contempt of
death which so great a number of them had shown, when they went through
with such an action as that was.</p>
