        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 3. How Claudius Was Seized Upon And Brought Out Of His House And
Brought To The Camp; And How The Senate Sent An Embassage To Him.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now Claudius, as I said before, went out of that way along which
Caius was gone; and as the family was in a mighty disorder upon the sad
accident of the murder of Caius, he was in great distress how to save
himself, and was found to have hidden himself in a certain narrow place,
though he had no other occasion for suspicion of any dangers, besides
the dignity of his birth; for while he was a private man, he behaved
himself with moderation, and was contented with his present fortune,
applying himself to learning, and especially to that of the Greeks, and
keeping himself entirely clear from every thing that might bring on any
disturbance. But as at this time the multitude were under a
consternation, and the whole palace was full of the soldiers&#x27; madness,
and the very emperor&#x27;s guards seemed under the like fear and disorder
with private persons, the band called pretorian, which was the purest
part of the army, was in consultation what was to be done at this
juncture. Now all those that were at this consultation had little regard
to the punishment Caius had suffered, because he justly deserved such
his fortune; but they were rather considering their own circumstances,
how they might take the best care of themselves, especially while the
Germans were busy in punishing the murderers of Caius; which yet was
rather done to gratify their own savage temper, than for the good of the
public; all which things disturbed Claudius, who was afraid of his own
safety, and this particularly because he saw the heads of Asprenas and
his partners carried about. His station had been on a certain elevated
place, whither a few steps led him, and whither he had retired in the
dark by himself. But when Gratus, who was one of the soldiers that
belonged to the palace, saw him, but did not well know by his
countenance who he was, because it was dark, though he could well judge
that it was a man who was privately there on some design, he came nearer
to him; and when Claudius desired that he would retire, he discovered
who he was, and owned him to be Claudius. So he said to his followers,
&quot;This is a Germanicus; 12 come on, let us choose him for our emperor.&quot;
But when Claudius saw they were making preparations for taking him away
by force, and was afraid they would kill him, as they had killed Caius,
he besought them to spare him, putting them in mind how quietly he had
demeaned himself, and that he was unacquainted with what had been done.
Hereupon Gratus smiled upon him, and took him by the right hand, and
said, &quot;Leave off, sir, these low thoughts of saving yourself, while you
ought to have greater thoughts, even of obtaining the empire, which the
gods, out of their concern for the habitable world, by taking Caius out
of the way, commit to thy virtuous conduct. Go to, therefore, and accept
of the throne of thy ancestors.&quot; So they took him up and carried him,
because he was not then able to go on foot, such was his dread and his
joy at what was told him.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. Now there was already gathered together about Gratus a great number
of the guards; and when they saw Claudius carried off, they looked with
a sad countenance, as supposing that he was carried to execution for the
mischiefs that had been lately done; while yet they thought him a man
who never meddled with public affairs all his life long, and one that
had met with no contemptible dangers under the reign of Caius; and some
of them thought it reasonable that the consuls should take cognizance of
these matters; and as still more and more of the soldiery got together,
the crowd about him ran away, and Claudius could hardly go on, his body
was then so weak; and those who carried his sedan, upon an inquiry that
was made about his being carried off, ran away and saved themselves, as
despairing of their Lord&#x27;s preservation. But when they were come into
the large court of the palace, [which, as the report goes about it, was
inhabited first of all the parts of the city of Rome,] and had just
reached the public treasury, many more soldiers came about him, as glad
to see Claudius&#x27;s face, and thought it exceeding right to make him
emperor, on account of their kindness for Germanicus, who was his
brother, and had left behind him a vast reputation among all that were
acquainted with him. They reflected also on the covetous temper of the
leading men of the senate, and what great errors they had been guilty of
when the senate had the government formerly; they also considered the
impossibility of such an undertaking, as also what dangers they should
be in, if the government should come to a single person, and that such a
one should possess it as they had no hand in advancing, and not to
Claudius, who would take it as their grant, and as gained by their good-
will to him, and would remember the favors they had done him, and would
make them a sufficient recompense for the same.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. These were the discourses the soldiers had one with another by
themselves, and they communicated them to all such as came in to them.
Now those that inquired about this matter willingly embraced the
invitation that was made them to join with the rest; so they carried
Claudius into the camp, crowding about him as his guard, and
encompassing him about, one chairman still succeeding another, that
their vehement endeavors might not be hindered. But as to the populace
and senators, they disagreed in their opinions. The latter were very
desirous to recover their former dignity, and were zealous to get clear
of the slavery that had been brought on them by the injurious treatment
of the tyrants, which the present opportunity afforded them; but for the
people, who were envious against them, and knew that the emperors were
capable of curbing their covetous temper, and were a refuge from them,
they were very glad that Claudius had been seized upon, and brought to
them, and thought that if Claudius were made emperor, he would prevent a
civil war, such as there was in the days of Pompey. But when the senate
knew that Claudius was brought into the camp by the soldiers, they sent
to him those of their body which had the best character for their
virtues, that they might inform him that he ought to do nothing by
violence, in order to gain the government; that he who was a single
person, one either already or hereafter to be a member of their body,
ought to yield to the senate, which consisted of so great a number; that
he ought to let the law take place in the disposal of all that related
to the public order, and to remember how greatly the former tyrants had
afflicted their city, and what dangers both he and they had escaped
under Caius; and that he ought not to hate the heavy burden of tyranny,
when the injury is done by others, while he did himself willfully treat
his country after a mad and insolent manner; that if he would comply
with them, and demonstrate that his firm resolution was to live quietly
and virtuously, he would have the greatest honors decreed to him that a
free people could bestow; and by subjecting himself to the law, would
obtain this branch of commendation, that he acted like a man of virtue,
both as a ruler and a subject; but that if he would act foolishly, and
learn no wisdom by Caius&#x27;s death, they would not permit him to go on;
that a great part of the army was got together for them, with plenty of
weapons, and a great number of slaves, which they could make use of;
that good hope was a great matter in such cases, as was also good
fortune; and that the gods would never assist any others but those that
undertook to act with virtue and goodness, who can be no other than such
as fight for the liberty of their country.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. Now these ambassadors, Veranius and Brocchus, who were both of them
tribunes of the people, made this speech to Claudius; and falling down
upon their knees, they begged of him that he would not throw the city
into wars and misfortunes; but when they saw what a multitude of
soldiers encompassed and guarded Claudius, and that the forces that were
with the consuls were, in comparison of them, perfectly inconsiderable,
they added, that if he did desire the government, he should accept of it
as given by the senate; that he would prosper better, and be happier, if
he came to it, not by the injustice, but by the good-will of those that
would bestow it upon him.</p>
