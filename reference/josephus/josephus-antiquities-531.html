        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 7. Herod Has Thoughts Of Killing Himself With His Own Hand; And
A Little Afterwards He Orders Antipater To Be Slain.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. As he was giving these commands to his relations, there came letters
from his ambassadors, who had been sent to Rome unto Cæsar, which, when
they were read, their purport was this: That Acme was slain by Cæsar,
out of his indignation at what hand, she had in Antipater&#x27;s wicked
practices; and that as to Antipater himself, Cæsar left it to Herod to
act as became a father and a king, and either to banish him, or to take
away his life, which he pleased. When Herod heard this, he was some-
what better, out of the pleasure he had from the contents of the
letters, and was elevated at the death of Acme, and at the power that
was given him over his son; but as his pains were become very great, he
was now ready to faint for want of somewhat to eat; so he called for an
apple and a knife; for it was his custom formerly to pare the apple
himself, and soon afterwards to cut it, and eat it. When he had got the
knife, he looked about, and had a mind to stab himself with it; and he
had done it, had not his first cousin, Achiabus, prevented him, and held
his hand, and cried out loudly. Whereupon a woeful lamentation echoed
through the palace, and a great tumult was made, as if the king were
dead. Upon which Antipater, who verily believed his father was deceased,
grew bold in his discourse, as hoping to be immediately and entirely
released from his bonds, and to take the kingdom into his hands without
any more ado; so he discoursed with the jailer about letting him go, and
in that case promised him great things, both now and hereafter, as if
that were the only thing now in question. But the jailer did not only
refuse to do what Antipater would have him, but informed the king of his
intentions, and how many solicitations he had had from him [of that
nature]. Hereupon Herod, who had formerly no affection nor good-will
towards his son to restrain him, when he heard what the jailer said, he
cried out, and beat his head, although he was at death&#x27;s door, and
raised himself upon his elbow, and sent for some of his guards, and
commanded them to kill Antipater without tiny further delay, and to do
it presently, and to bury him in an ignoble manner at Hyrcania.</p>
