        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 6. How Joseph When He Was Become Famous In Egypt, Had His
Brethren In Subjection.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Joseph was now grown up to thirty years of age, and enjoyed great
honors from the king, who called him Psothom Phanech, out of regard to
his prodigious degree of wisdom; for that name denotes the revealer of
secrets. He also married a wife of very high quality; for he married the
daughter of Petephres, 4 one of the priests of Heliopolis; she was a
virgin, and her name was Asenath. By her he had children before the
scarcity came on; Manasseh, the elder, which signifies forgetful,
because his present happiness made him forget his former misfortunes;
and Ephraim, the younger, which signifies restored, because he was
restored to the freedom of his forefathers. Now after Egypt had happily
passed over seven years, according to Joseph&#x27;s interpretation of the
dreams, the famine came upon them in the eighth year; and because this
misfortune fell upon them when they had no sense of it beforehand, 5
they were all sorely afflicted by it, and came running to the king&#x27;s
gates; and he called upon Joseph, who sold the corn to them, being
become confessedly a savior to the whole multitude of the Egyptians. Nor
did he open this market of corn for the people of that country only, but
strangers had liberty to buy also; Joseph being willing that all men,
who are naturally akin to one another, should have assistance from those
that lived in happiness.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. Now Jacob also, when he understood that foreigners might come, sent
all his sons into Egypt to buy corn, for the land of Canaan was
grievously afflicted with the famine; and this great misery touched the
whole continent. He only retained Benjamin, who was born to him by
Rachel, and was of the same mother with Joseph. These sons of Jacob then
came into Egypt, and applied themselves to Joseph, wanting to buy corn;
for nothing of this kind was done without his approbation, since even
then only was the honor that was paid the king himself advantageous to
the persons that paid it, when they took care to honor Joseph also. Now
when he well knew his brethren, they thought nothing of him; for he was
but a youth when he left them, and was now come to an age so much
greater, that the lineaments of his face were changed, and he was not
known by them: besides this, the greatness of the dignity wherein he
appeared, suffered them not so much as to suspect it was he. He now made
trial what sentiments they had about affairs of the greatest
consequence; for he refused to sell them corn, and said they were come
as spies of the king&#x27;s affairs; and that they came from several
countries, and joined themselves together, and pretended that they were
of kin, it not being possible that a private man should breed up so many
sons, and those of so great beauty of countenance as they were, such an
education of so many children being not easily obtained by kings
themselves. Now this he did in order to discover what concerned his
father, and what happened to him after his own departure from him, and
as desiring to know what was become of Benjamin his brother; for he was
afraid that they had ventured on the like wicked enterprise against him
that they had done to himself, and had taken him off also.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. Now these brethren of his were under distraction and terror, and
thought that very great danger hung over them; yet not at all reflecting
upon their brother Joseph, and standing firm under the accusations laid
against them, they made their defense by Reubel, the eldest of them, who
now became their spokesman: &quot;We come not hither,&quot; said he, &quot;with any
unjust design, nor in order to bring any harm to the king&#x27;s affairs; we
only want to be preserved, as supposing your humanity might be a refuge
for us from the miseries which our country labors under, we having heard
that you proposed to sell corn, not only to your own countrymen, but to
strangers also, and that you determined to allow that corn, in order to
preserve all that want it; but that we are brethren, and of the same
common blood, the peculiar lineaments of our faces, and those not so
much different from one another, plainly show. Our father&#x27;s name is
Jacob, an Hebrew man, who had twelve of us for his sons by four wives;
which twelve of us, while we were all alive, were a happy family; but
when one of our brethren, whose name was Joseph, died, our affairs
changed for the worse, for our father could not forbear to make a long
lamentation for him; and we are in affliction, both by the calamity of
the death of our brother, and the miserable state of our aged father. We
are now, therefore, come to buy corn, having intrusted the care of our
father, and the provision for our family, to Benjamin, our youngest
brother; and if thou sendest to our house, thou mayst learn whether we
are guilty of the least falsehood in what we say.&quot;</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. And thus did Reubel endeavor to persuade Joseph to have a better
opinion of them. But when he had learned from them that Jacob was alive,
and that his brother was not destroyed by them, he for the present put
them in prison, as intending to examine more into their affairs when he
should be at leisure. But on the third day he brought them out, and said
to them, &quot;Since you constantly affirm that you are not come to do any
harm to the king&#x27;s affairs; that you are brethren, and the sons of the
father whom you named; you will satisfy me of the truth of what you say,
if you leave one of your company with me, who shall suffer no injury
here; and if, when ye have carried corn to your father, you will come to
me again, and bring your brother, whom you say you left there, along
with you, for this shall be by me esteemed an assurance of the truth of
what you have told me.&quot; Hereupon they were in greater grief than before;
they wept, and perpetually deplored one among another the calamity of
Joseph; and said, &quot;They were fallen into this misery as a punishment
inflicted by God for what evil contrivances they had against him.&quot; And
Reubel was large in his reproaches of them for their too late
repentance, whence no profit arose to Joseph; and earnestly exhorted
them to bear with patience whatever they suffered, since it was done by
God in way of punishment, on his account. Thus they spake to one
another, not imagining that Joseph understood their language. A general
sadness also seized on them at Reubel&#x27;s words, and a repentance for what
they had done; and they condemned the wickedness they had perpetrated,
for which they judged they were justly punished by God. Now when Joseph
saw that they were in this distress, he was so affected at it that he
fell into tears, and not being willing that they should take notice of
him, he retired; and after a while came to them again, and taking Symeon
6 in order to his being a pledge for his brethren&#x27;s return, he bid them
take the corn they had bought, and go their way. He also commanded his
steward privily to put the money which they had brought with them for
the purchase of corn into their sacks, and to dismiss them therewith;
who did what he was commanded to do.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">5. Now when Jacob&#x27;s sons were come into the land of Canaan, they told
their father what had happened to them in Egypt, and that they were
taken to have come thither as spies upon the king; and how they said
they were brethren, and had left their eleventh brother with their
father, but were not believed; and how they had left Symeon with the
governor, until Benjamin should go thither, and be a testimonial of the
truth of what they had said: and they begged of their father to fear
nothing, but to send the lad along with them. But Jacob was not pleased
with any thing his sons had done; and he took the detention of Symeon
heinously, and thence thought it a foolish thing to give up Benjamin
also. Neither did he yield to Reubel&#x27;s persuasion, though he begged it
of him, and gave leave that the grandfather might, in way of requital,
kill his own sons, in case any harm came to Benjamin in the journey. So
they were distressed, and knew not what to do; nay, there was another
accident that still disturbed them more,—the money that was found hidden
in their sacks of corn. Yet when the corn they had brought failed them,
and when the famine still afflicted them, and necessity forced them,
Jacob did 7 [not] still resolve to send Benjamin with his brethren,
although there was no returning into Egypt unless they came with what
they had promised. Now the misery growing every day worse, and his sons
begging it of him, he had no other course to take in his present
circumstances. And Judas, who was of a bold temper on other occasions,
spake his mind very freely to him: &quot;That it did not become him to be
afraid on account of his son, nor to suspect the worst, as he did; for
nothing could be done to his son but by the appointment of God, which
must also for certain come to pass, though he were at home with him;
that he ought not to condemn them to such manifest destruction; nor
deprive them of that plenty of food they might have from Pharaoh, by his
unreasonable fear about his son Benjamin, but ought to take care of the
preservation of Symeon, lest, by attempting to hinder Benjamin&#x27;s
journey, Symeon should perish. He exhorted him to trust God for him; and
said he would either bring his son back to him safe, or, together with
his, lose his own life.&quot; So that Jacob was at length persuaded, and
delivered Benjamin to them, with the price of the corn doubled; he also
sent presents to Joseph of the fruits of the land of Canaan, balsam and
rosin, as also turpentine and honey. 8 Now their father shed many tears
at the departure of his sons, as well as themselves. His concern was,
that he might receive them back again safe after their journey; and
their concern was, that they might find their father well, and no way
afflicted with grief for them. And this lamentation lasted a whole day;
so that the old man was at last tired with grief, and staid behind; but
they went on their way for Egypt, endeavoring to mitigate their grief
for their present misfortunes, with the hopes of better success
hereafter.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">6. As soon as they came into Egypt, they were brought down to Joseph:
but here no small fear disturbed them, lest they should be accused about
the price of the corn, as if they had cheated Joseph. They then made a
long apology to Joseph&#x27;s steward; and told him, that when they came home
they found the money in their sacks, and that they had now brought it
along with them. He said he did not know what they meant: so they were
delivered from that fear. And when he had loosed Symeon, and put him
into a handsome habit, he suffered him to be with his brethren; at which
time Joseph came from his attendance on the king. So they offered him
their presents; and upon his putting the question to them about their
father, they answered that they found him well. He also, upon his
discovery that Benjamin was alive, asked whether this was their younger
brother; for he had seen him. Whereupon they said he was: he replied,
that the God over all was his protector. But when his affection to him
made him shed tears, he retired, desiring he might not be seen in that
plight by his brethren. Then Joseph took them to supper, and they were
set down in the same order as they used to sit at their father&#x27;s table.
And although Joseph treated them all kindly, yet did he send a mess to
Benjamin that was double to what the rest of the guests had for their
shares.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">7. Now when after supper they had composed themselves to sleep, Joseph
commanded his steward both to give them their measures of corn, and to
hide its price again in their sacks; and that withal they should put
into Benjamin&#x27;s sack the golden cup, out of which he loved himself to
drink.—which things he did, in order to make trial of his brethren,
whether they would stand by Benjamin when he should be accused of having
stolen the cup, and should appear to be in danger; or whether they would
leave him, and, depending on their own innocency, go to their father
without him. When the servant had done as he was bidden, the sons of
Jacob, knowing nothing of all this, went their way, and took Symeon
along with them, and had a double cause of joy, both because they had
received him again, and because they took back Benjamin to their father,
as they had promised. But presently a troop of horsemen encompassed
them, and brought with them Joseph&#x27;s servant, who had put the cup into
Benjamin&#x27;s sack. Upon which unexpected attack of the horsemen they were
much disturbed, and asked what the reason was that they came thus upon
men, who a little before had been by their lord thought worthy of an
honorable and hospitable reception? They replied, by calling them wicked
wretches, who had forgot that very hospitable and kind treatment which
Joseph had given them, and did not scruple to be injurious to him, and
to carry off that cup out of which he had, in so friendly a manner,
drank to them, and not regarding their friendship with Joseph, no more
than the danger they should be in if they were taken, in comparison of
the unjust gain. Hereupon he threatened that they should be punished;
for though they had escaped the knowledge of him who was but a servant,
yet had they not escaped the knowledge of God, nor had gone off with
what they had stolen; and, after all, asked why we come upon them, as if
they knew nothing of the matter: and he told them that they should
immediately know it by their punishment. This, and more of the same
nature, did the servant say, in way of reproach to them: but they being
wholly ignorant of any thing here that concerned them, laughed at what
he said, and wondered at the abusive language which the servant gave
them, when he was so hardy as to accuse those who did not before so much
as retain the price of their corn, which was found in their sacks, but
brought it again, though nobody else knew of any such thing,—so far were
they from offering any injury to Joseph voluntarily. But still,
supposing that a search would be a more sure justification of themselves
than their own denial of the fact, they bid him search them, and that if
any of them had been guilty of the theft, to punish them all; for being
no way conscious to themselves of any crime, they spake with assurance,
and, as they thought, without any danger to themselves also. The
servants desired there might be a search made; but they said the
punishment should extend to him alone who should be found guilty of the
theft. So they made the search; and, having searched all the rest, they
came last of all to Benjamin, as knowing it was Benjamin&#x27;s sack in which
they had hidden the cup, they having indeed searched the rest only for a
show of accuracy: so the rest were out of fear for themselves, and were
now only concerned about Benjamin, but still were well assured that he
would also be found innocent; and they reproached those that came after
them for their hindering them, while they might, in the mean while, have
gotten a good way on their journey. But as soon as they had searched
Benjamin&#x27;s sack, they found the cup, and took it from him; and all was
changed into mourning and lamentation. They rent their garments, and
wept for the punishment which their brother was to undergo for his
theft, and for the delusion they had put on their father, when they
promised they would bring Benjamin safe to him. What added to their
misery was, that this melancholy accident came unfortunately at a time
when they thought they had been gotten off clear; but they confessed
that this misfortune of their brother, as well as the grief of their
father for him, was owing to themselves, since it was they that forced
their father to send him with them, when he was averse to it.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">8. The horsemen therefore took Benjamin and brought him to Joseph, his
brethren also following him; who, when he saw him in custody, and them
in the habit of mourners, said, &quot;How came you, vile wretches as you are,
to have such a strange notion of my kindness to you, and of God&#x27;s
providence, as impudently to do thus to your benefactor, who in such an
hospitable manner had entertained you?&quot; Whereupon they gave up
themselves to be punished, in order to save Benjamin; and called to mind
what a wicked enterprise they had been guilty of against Joseph. They
also pronounced him more happy than themselves, if he were dead, in
being freed from the miseries of this life; and if he were alive, that
he enjoyed the pleasure of seeing God&#x27;s vengeance upon them. They said
further; that they were the plague of their father, since they should
now add to his former affliction for Joseph, this other affliction for
Benjamin. Reubel also was large in cutting them upon this occasion. But
Joseph dismissed them; for he said they had been guilty of no offense,
and that he would content himself with the lad&#x27;s punishment; for he said
it was not a fit thing to let him go free, for the sake of those who had
not offended; nor was it a fit thing to punish them together with him
who had been guilty of stealing. And when he promised to give them leave
to go away in safety, the rest of them were under great consternation,
and were able to say nothing on this sad occasion. But Judas, who had
persuaded their father to send the lad from him, being otherwise also a
very bold and active man, determined to hazard himself for the
preservation of his brother. &quot;It is true,&quot; 9 said he, &quot;O governor, that
we have been very wicked with regard to thee, and on that account
deserved punishment; even all of us may justly be punished, although the
theft were not committed by all, but only by one of us, and he the
youngest also; but yet there remains some hope for us, who otherwise
must be under despair on his account, and this from thy goodness, which
promises us a deliverance out of our present danger. And now I beg thou
wilt not look at us, or at that great crime we have been guilty of, but
at thy own excellent nature, and take advice of thine own virtue,
instead of that wrath thou hast against us; which passion those that
otherwise are of lower character indulge, as they do their strength, and
that not only on great, but also on very trifling occasions. Overcome,
sir, that passion, and be not subdued by it, nor suffer it to slay those
that do not otherwise presume upon their own safety, but are desirous to
accept of it from thee; for this is not the first time that thou wilt
bestow it on us, but before, when we came to buy corn, thou affordedst
us great plenty of food, and gavest us leave to carry so much home to
our family as has preserved them from perishing by famine. Nor is there
any difference between not overlooking men that were perishing for want
of necessaries, and not punishing those that seem to be offenders, and
have been so unfortunate as to lose the advantage of that glorious
benefaction which they received from thee. This will be an instance of
equal favor, though bestowed after a different manner; for thou wilt
save those this way whom thou didst feed the other; and thou wilt hereby
preserve alive, by thy own bounty, those souls which thou didst not
suffer to be distressed by famine, it being indeed at once a wonderful
and a great thing to sustain our lives by corn, and to bestow on us that
pardon, whereby, now we are distressed, we may continue those lives. And
I am ready to suppose that God is willing to afford thee this
opportunity of showing thy virtuous disposition, by bringing us into
this calamity, that it may appear thou canst forgive the injuries that
are done to thyself, and mayst be esteemed kind to others, besides those
who, on other accounts, stand in need of thy assistance; since it is
indeed a right thing to do well to those who are in distress for want of
food, but still a more glorious thing to save those who deserve to be
punished, when it is on account of heinous offenses against thyself; for
if it be a thing deserving commendation to forgive such as have been
guilty of small offenses, that tend to a person&#x27;s loss, and this be
praiseworthy in him that overlooks such offenses, to restrain a man&#x27;s
passion as to crimes which are capital to the guilty, is to be like the
most excellent nature of God himself. And truly, as for myself, had it
not been that we had a father, who had discovered, on occasion of the
death of Joseph, how miserably he is always afflicted at the loss of his
sons, I had not made any words on account of the saving of our own
lives; I mean, any further than as that would be an excellent character
for thyself, to preserve even those that would have nobody to lament
them when they were dead, but we would have yielded ourselves up to
suffer whatsoever thou pleasedst; but now [for we do not plead for mercy
to ourselves, though indeed, if we die, it will be while we are young,
and before we have had the enjoyment of life] have regard to our father,
and take pity of his old age, on whose account it is that we make these
supplications to thee. We beg thou wilt give us those lives which this
wickedness of ours has rendered obnoxious to thy punishment; and this
for his sake who is not himself wicked, nor does his being our father
make us wicked. He is a good man, and not worthy to have such trials of
his patience; and now, we are absent, he is afflicted with care for us.
But if he hear of our deaths, and what was the cause of it, he will on
that account die an immature death; and the reproachful manner of our
ruin will hasten his end, and will directly kill him; nay, will bring
him to a miserable death, while he will make haste to rid himself out of
the world, and bring himself to a state of insensibility, before the sad
story of our end come abroad into the rest of the world. Consider these
things in this manner, although our wickedness does now provoke thee
with a just desire of punishing that wickedness, and forgive it for our
father&#x27;s sake; and let thy commiseration of him weigh more with thee
than our wickedness. Have regard to the old age of our father, who, if
we perish, will be very lonely while he lives, and will soon die himself
also. 10 Grant this boon to the name of fathers, for thereby thou wilt
honor him that begat thee, and will grant it to thyself also, who
enjoyest already that denomination; thou wilt then, by that
denomination, be preserved of God, the Father of all,—by showing a pious
regard to which, in the case of our father, thou wilt appear to honor
him who is styled by the same name; I mean, if thou wilt have this pity
on our father, upon this consideration, how miserable he will be if he
be deprived of his sons! It is thy part therefore to bestow on us what
God has given us, when it is in thy power to take it away, and so to
resemble him entirely in charity; for it is good to use that power,
which can either give or take away, on the merciful side; and when it is
in thy power to destroy, to forget that thou ever hadst that power, and
to look on thyself as only allowed power for preservation; and that the
more any one extends this power, the greater reputation does he gain to
himself. Now, by forgiving our brother what he has unhappily committed,
thou wilt preserve us all; for we cannot think of living if he be put to
death, since we dare not show ourselves alive to our father without our
brother, but here must we partake of one and the same catastrophe of his
life. And so far we beg of thee, O governor, that if thou condemnest our
brother to die, thou wilt punish us together with him, as partners of
his crime,—for we shall not think it reasonable to be reserved to kill
ourselves for grief of our brother&#x27;s death, but so to die rather as
equally guilty with him of this crime. I will only leave with thee this
one consideration, and then will say no more, viz. that our brother
committed this fault when he was young, and not yet of confirmed wisdom
in his conduct; and that men naturally forgive such young persons. I end
here, without adding what more I have to say, that in case thou
condemnest us, that omission may be supposed to have hurt us, and
permitted thee to take the severer side. But in case thou settest us
free, that this may be ascribed to thy own goodness, of which thou art
inwardly conscious, that thou freest us from condemnation; and that not
by barely preserving us, but by granting us such a favor as will make us
appear more righteous than we really are, and by representing to thyself
more motives for our deliverance than we are able to produce ourselves.
If, therefore, thou resolvest to slay him, I desire thou wilt slay me in
his stead, and send him back to his father; or if thou pleasest to
retain him with thee as a slave, I am fitter to labor for thy advantage
in that capacity, and, as thou seest, am better prepared for either of
those sufferings.&quot; So Judas, being very willing to undergo any thing
whatever for the deliverance of his brother, cast himself down at
Joseph&#x27;s feet, and earnestly labored to assuage and pacify his anger.
All his brethren also fell down before him, weeping and delivering
themselves up to destruction for the preservation of the life of
Benjamin.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">10. But Joseph, as overcome now with his affections, and no longer able
to personate an angry man, commanded all that were present to depart,
that he might make himself known to his brethren when they were alone;
and when the rest were gone out, he made himself known to his brethren;
and said, &quot;I commend you for your virtue, and your kindness to our
brother: I find you better men than I could have expected from what you
contrived about me. Indeed, I did all this to try your love to your
brother; so I believe you were not wicked by nature in what you did in
my case, but that all has happened according to God&#x27;s will, who has
hereby procured our enjoyment of what good things we have; and, if he
continue in a favorable disposition, of what we hope for hereafter.
Since, therefore, I know that our father is safe and well, beyond
expectation, and I see you so well disposed to your brother, I will no
longer remember what guilt you seem to have had about me, but will leave
off to hate you for that your wickedness; and do rather return you my
thanks, that you have concurred with the intentions of God to bring
things to their present state. I would have you also rather to forget
the same, since that imprudence of yours is come to such a happy
conclusion, than to be uneasy and blush at those your offenses. Do not,
therefore, let your evil intentions, when you condemned me, and that
bitter remorse which might follow, be a grief to you now, because those
intentions were frustrated. Go, therefore, your way, rejoicing in what
has happened by the Divine Providence, and inform your father of it,
lest he should be spent with cares for you, and deprive me of the most
agreeable part of my felicity; I mean, lest he should die before he
comes into my sight, and enjoys the good things that we now have. Bring,
therefore, with you our father, and your wives and children, and all
your kindred, and remove your habitations hither; for it is not proper
that the persons dearest to me should live remote from me, now my
affairs are so prosperous, especially when they must endure five more
years of famine.&quot; When Joseph had said this, he embraced his brethren,
who were in tears and sorrow; but the generous kindness of their brother
seemed to leave among them no room for fear, lest they should be
punished on account of what they had consulted and acted against him;
and they were then feasting. Now the king, as soon as he heard that
Joseph&#x27;s brethren were come to him, was exceeding glad of it, as if it
had been a part of his own good fortune; and gave them wagons full of
corn and gold and silver, to be conveyed to his father. Now when they
had received more of their brother part to be carried to their father,
