        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 4. What Happened To The Hebrews During Thirty-Eight Years In The
Wilderness.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. However, this sedition was so far from ceasing upon this destruction,
that it grew much stronger, and became more intolerable. And the
occasion of its growing worse was of that nature, as made it likely the
calamity would never cease, but last for a long time; for the men,
believing already that nothing is done without the providence of God,
would have it that these things came thus to pass not without God&#x27;s
favor to Moses; they therefore laid the blame upon him that God was so
angry, and that this happened not so much because of the wickedness of
those that were punished, as because Moses procured the punishment; and
that these men had been destroyed without any sin of theirs, only
because they were zealous about the Divine worship; as also, that he who
had been the cause of this diminution of the people, by destroying so
many men, and those the most excellent of them all, besides his escaping
any punishment himself, had now given the priesthood to his brother so
firmly, that nobody could any longer dispute it with him; for no one
else, to be sure, could now put in for it, since he must have seen those
that first did so to have miserably perished. Nay, besides this, the
kindred of those that were destroyed made great entreaties to the
multitude to abate the arrogance of Moses, because it would be safest
for them so to do.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. Now Moses, upon his hearing for a good while that the people were
tumultuous, was afraid that they would attempt some other innovation,
and that some great and sad calamity would be the consequence. He called
the multitude to a congregation, and patiently heard what apology they
had to make for themselves, without opposing them, and this lest he
should imbitter the multitude: he only desired the heads of the tribes
to bring their rods, 3 with the names of their tribes inscribed upon
them, and that he should receive the priesthood in whose rod God should
give a sign. This was agreed to. So the rest brought their rods, as did
Aaron also, who had written the tribe of Levi on his rod. These rods
Moses laid up in the tabernacle of God. On the next day he brought out
the rods, which were known from one another by those who brought them,
they having distinctly noted them, as had the multitude also; and as to
the rest, in the same form Moses had received them, in that they saw
them still; but they also saw buds and branches grown out of Aaron&#x27;s
rod, with ripe fruits upon them; they were almonds, the rod having been
cut out of that tree. The people were so amazed at this strange sight,
that though Moses and Aaron were before under some degree of hatred,
they now laid that hatred aside, and began to admire the judgment of God
concerning them; so that hereafter they applauded what God had decreed,
and permitted Aaron to enjoy the priesthood peaceably. And thus God
ordained him priest three several times, and he retained that honor
without further disturbance. And hereby this sedition of the Hebrews,
which had been a great one, and had lasted a great while, was at last
composed.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. And now Moses, because the tribe of Levi was made free from war and
warlike expeditions, and was set apart for the Divine worship, lest they
should want and seek after the necessaries of life, and so neglect the
temple, commanded the Hebrews, according to the will of God, that when
they should gain the possession of the land of Canaan, they should
assign forty-eight good and fair cities to the Levites; and permit them
to enjoy their suburbs, as far as the limit of two thousand cubits would
extend from the walls of the city. And besides this, he appointed that
the people should pay the tithe of their annual fruits of the earth,
both to the Levites and to the priests. And this is what that tribe
receives of the multitude; but I think it necessary to set down what is
paid by all, peculiarly to the priests.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. Accordingly he commanded the Levites to yield up to the priests
thirteen of their forty-eight cities, and to set apart for them the
tenth part of the tithes which they every year receive of the people; as
also, that it was but just to offer to God the first-fruits of the
entire product of the ground; and that they should offer the first-born
of those four-footed beasts that are appointed for sacrifices, if it be
a male, to the priests, to be slain, that they and their entire families
may eat them in the holy city; but that the owners of those first-born
which are not appointed for sacrifices in the laws of our country,
should bring a shekel and a half in their stead: but for the first-born
of a man, five shekels: that they should also have the first-fruits out
of the shearing of the sheep; and that when any baked bread corn, and
made loaves of it, they should give somewhat of what they had baked to
them. Moreover, when any have made a sacred vow, I mean those that are
called Nazarites, that suffer their hair to grow long, and use no wine,
when they consecrate their hair, 4 and offer it for a sacrifice, they
are to allot that hair for the priests [to be thrown into the fire].
Such also as dedicate themselves to God, as a corban, which denotes what
the Greeks call a gift, when they are desirous of being freed from that
ministration, are to lay down money for the priests; thirty shekels if
it be a woman, and fifty if it be a man; but if any be too poor to pay
the appointed sum, it shall be lawful for the priests to determine that
sum as they think fit. And if any slay beasts at home for a private
festival, but not for a religious one, they are obliged to bring the maw
and the cheek, [or breast,] and the right shoulder of the sacrifice, to
the priests. With these Moses contrived that the priests should be
plentifully maintained, besides what they had out of those offerings for
sins which the people gave them, as I have set it down in the foregoing
book. He also ordered, that out of every thing allotted for the priests,
their servants, [their sons,] their daughters, and their wives, should
partake, as well as themselves, excepting what came to them out of the
sacrifices that were offered for sins; for of those none but the males
of the family of the priests might eat, and this in the temple also, and
that the same day they were offered.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">5. When Moses had made these constitutions, after the sedition was over,
he removed, together with the whole army, and came to the borders of
Idumea. He then sent ambassadors to the king of the Idumeans, and
desired him to give him a passage through his country; and agreed to
send him what hostages he should desire, to secure him from an injury.
He desired him also, that he would allow his army liberty to buy
provisions; and, if he insisted upon it, he would pay down a price for
the very water they should drink. But the king was not pleased with this
embassage from Moses: nor did he allow a passage for the army, but
brought his people armed to meet Moses, and to hinder them, in case they
should endeavor to force their passage. Upon which Moses consulted God
by the oracle, who would not have him begin the war first; and so he
withdrew his forces, and traveled round about through the wilderness.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">6. Then it was that Miriam, the sister of Moses, came to her end, having
completed her fortieth year 5 since she left Egypt, on the first 6 day
of the lunar month Xanthicus. They then made a public funeral for her,
at a great expense. She was buried upon a certain mountain, which they
call Sin: and when they had mourned for her thirty days, Moses purified
the people after this manner: He brought a heifer that had never been
used to the plough or to husbandry, that was complete in all its parts,
and entirely of a red color, at a little distance from the camp, into a
place perfectly clean. This heifer was slain by the high priest, and her
blood sprinkled with his finger seven times before the tabernacle of
God; after this, the entire heifer was burnt in that state, together
with its skin and entrails; and they threw cedar-wood, and hyssop, and
scarlet wool, into the midst of the fire; then a clean man gathered all
her ashes together, and laid them in a place perfectly clean. When
therefore any persons were defiled by a dead body, they put a little of
these ashes into spring water, with hyssop, and, dipping part of these
ashes in it, they sprinkled them with it, both on the third day, and on
the seventh, and after that they were clean. This he enjoined them to do
also when the tribes should come into their own land.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">7. Now when this purification, which their leader made upon the mourning
for his sister, as it has been now described, was over, he caused the
army to remove and to march through the wilderness and through Arabia;
and when he came to a place which the Arabians esteem their metropolis,
which was formerly called Arce, but has now the name of Petra, at this
place, which was encompassed with high mountains, Aaron went up one of
them in the sight of the whole army, Moses having before told him that
he was to die, for this place was over against them. He put off his
pontifical garments, and delivered them to Eleazar his son, to whom the
high priesthood belonged, because he was the elder brother; and died
while the multitude looked upon him. He died in the same year wherein he
lost his sister, having lived in all a hundred twenty and three years.
He died on the first day of that lunar month which is called by the
Athenians Hecatombaeon, by the Macedonians Lous, but by the Hebrews
Abba.</p>
