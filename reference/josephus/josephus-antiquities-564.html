        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 6. How There Happened A Quarrel Between The Jews And The
Samaritans; And How Claudius Put An End To Their Differences.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now there arose a quarrel between the Samaritans and the Jews on the
occasion following: It was the custom of the Galileans, when they came
to the holy city at the festivals, to take their journeys through the
country of the Samaritans; 11 and at this time there lay, in the road
they took, a village that was called Ginea, which was situated in the
limits of Samaria and the great plain, where certain persons thereto
belonging fought with the Galileans, and killed a great many of them.
But when the principal of the Galileans were informed of what had been
done, they came to Cumanus, and desired him to avenge the murder of
those that were killed; but he was induced by the Samaritans, with
money, to do nothing in the matter; upon which the Galileans were much
displeased, and persuaded the multitude of the Jews to betake themselves
to arms, and to regain their liberty, saying that slavery was in itself
a bitter thing, but that when it was joined with direct injuries, it was
perfectly intolerable, And when their principal men endeavored to pacify
them, and promised to endeavor to persuade Cumanus to avenge those that
were killed, they would not hearken to them, but took their weapons, and
entreated the assistance of Eleazar, the son of Dineus, a robber, who
had many years made his abode in the mountains, with which assistance
they plundered many villages of the Samaritans. When Cumanus heard of
this action of theirs, he took the band of Sebaste, with four regiments
of footmen, and armed the Samaritans, and marched out against the Jews,
and caught them, and slew many of them, and took a great number of them
alive; whereupon those that were the most eminent persons at Jerusalem,
and that both in regard to the respect that was paid them, and the
families they were of, as soon as they saw to what a height things were
gone, put on sackcloth, and heaped ashes upon their heads, and by all
possible means besought the seditious, and persuaded them that they
would set before their eyes the utter subversion of their country, the
conflagration of their temple, and the slavery of themselves, their
wives, and children, 12 which would be the consequences of what they
were doing; and would alter their minds, would cast away their weapons,
and for the future be quiet, and return to their own homes. These
persuasions of theirs prevailed upon them. So the people dispersed
themselves, and the robbers went away again to their places of strength;
and after this time all Judea was overrun with robberies.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. But the principal of the Samaritans went to Ummidius Quadratus, the
president of Syria, who at that time was at Tyre, and accused the Jews
of setting their villages on fire, and plundering them; and said withal,
that they were not so much displeased at what they had suffered, as they
were at the contempt thereby showed the Romans; while if they had
received any injury, they ought to have made them the judges of what had
been done, and not presently to make such devastation, as if they had
not the Romans for their governors; on which account they came to him,
in order to obtain that vengeance they wanted. This was the accusation
which the Samaritans brought against the Jews. But the Jews affirmed
that the Samaritans were the authors of this tumult and fighting, and
that, in the first place, Cumanus had been corrupted by their gifts, and
passed over the murder of those that were slain in silence;—which
allegations when Quadratus heard, he put off the hearing of the cause,
and promised that he would give sentence when he should come into Judea,
and should have a more exact knowledge of the truth of that matter. So
these men went away without success. Yet was it not long ere Quadratus
came to Samaria, where, upon hearing the cause, he supposed that the
Samaritans were the authors of that disturbance. But when he was
informed that certain of the Jews were making innovations, he ordered
those to be crucified whom Cumanus had taken captives. From whence he
came to a certain village called Lydda, which was not less than a city
in largeness, and there heard the Samaritan cause a second time before
his tribunal, and there learned from a certain Samaritan that one of the
chief of the Jews, whose name was Dortus, and some other innovators with
him, four in number, persuaded the multitude to a revolt from the
Romans; whom Quadratus ordered to be put to death: but still he sent
away Ananias the high priest, and Ananus the commander [of the temple],
in bonds to Rome, to give an account of what they had done to Claudius
Cæsar. He also ordered the principal men, both of the Samaritans and of
the Jews, as also Cumanus the procurator, and Celer the tribune, to go
to Italy to the emperor, that he might hear their cause, and determine
their differences one with another. But he came again to the city of
Jerusalem, out of his fear that the multitude of the Jews should attempt
some innovations; but he found the city in a peaceable state, and
celebrating one of the usual festivals of their country to God. So he
believed that they would not attempt any innovations, and left them at
the celebration of the festival, and returned to Antioch.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. Now Cumanus, and the principal of the Samaritans, who were sent to
Rome, had a day appointed them by the emperor whereon they were to have
pleaded their cause about the quarrels they had one with another. But
now Cæsar&#x27;s freed-men and his friends were very zealous on the behalf of
Cumanus and the Samaritans; and they had prevailed over the Jews, unless
Agrippa, junior, who was then at Rome, had seen the principal of the
Jews hard set, and had earnestly entreated Agrippina, the emperor&#x27;s
wife, to persuade her husband to hear the cause, so as was agreeable to
his justice, and to condemn those to be punished who were really the
authors of this revolt from the Roman government:—whereupon Claudius was
so well disposed beforehand, that when he had heard the cause, and found
that the Samaritans had been the ringleaders in those mischievous
doings, he gave order that those who came up to him should be slain, and
that Cumanus should be banished. He also gave order that Celer the
tribune should be carried back to Jerusalem, and should be drawn through
the city in the sight of all the people, and then should be slain.</p>
