        <p>noted are these: [1.] That Josephus says the candlestick here carried in
this triumph was not thoroughly like that which was used in the temple,
which appears in the number of the little knobs and flowers in that on
the triumphal arch not well agreeing with Moses&#x27;s description, Exodus
25:31-36. [2.] The smallness of the branches in Josephus compared with
the thickness of those on that arch. [3.] That the Law or Pentateuch
does not appear on that arch at all, though Josephus, an eye-witness,
assures us that it was carried in this procession. All which things
deserve the consideration of the inquisitive reader.]</p>
        <p>10 (return) [ Spanheim observes here, that in Graceia Major and
Sicily they had rue prodigiously great and durable, like this rue at
Machaerus.]</p>
        <p>11 (return) [ This strange account of the place and root Baaras seems to
have been taken from the magicians, and the root to have been made use
of in the days of Josephus, in that superstitious way of casting out
demons, supposed by him to have been derived from king Solomon; of which
we have already seen he had a great opinion, Antiq. B. VIII. ch. 2.
sect. 5. We also may hence learn the true notion Josephus had of demons
and demoniacs, exactly like that of the Jews and Christians in the New
Testament, and the first four centuries. See Antiq. B. I. ch. 8. sect.
2; B. XI, ch. 2. sect. 3.]</p>
        <p>12 (return) [ It is very remarkable that Titus did not people this now
desolate country of Judea, but ordered it to be all sold; nor indeed is
it properly peopled at this day, but lies ready for its old inhabitants
the Jews, at their future restoration. See Literal Accomplishment of
Prophecies, p. 77.]</p>
        <p>13 (return) [ That the city Emmaus, or Areindus, in Josephus and others
which was the place of the government of Julius Africanus were slain,
to the number of one thousand seven hundred, as were the women and the
children made slaves. But as Bassus thought he must perform the covenant
he had made with those that had surrendered the citadel, he let them go,
and restored Eleazar to them, in the beginning of the third century, and
which he then procured to be rebuilt, and after which rebuilding it
was called Nicopolis, is entirely different from that Emmaus which is
mentioned by St. Luke 24;13; see Reland&#x27;s Paleestina, lib. II. p. 429,
and under the name Ammaus also. But he justly thinks that that in St.
Luke may well be the same with his Ammaus before us, especially since
the Greek copies here usually make it sixty furlongs distant from
Jerusalem, as does St. Luke, though the Latin copies say only thirty.
The place also allotted for these eight hundred soldiers, as for a Roman
garrison, in this place, would most naturally be not so remote from
Jerusalem as was the other Emmaus, or Nicopolis.]</p>
        <p>14 (return) [ Pliny and others confirm this strange paradox, that
provisions laid up against sieges will continue good for a hundred
years, as Spanheim notes upon this place.]</p>
        <p>15 (return) [ The speeches in this and the next section, as introduced
under the person of this Eleazar, are exceeding remarkable, and of the
noblest subjects, the contempt of death, and the dignity and immortality
of the soul; and that not only among the Jews, but among the Indians
themselves also; and are highly worthy the perusal of all the curious.
It seems as if that philosophic lady who survived, ch. 9. sect. 1, 2,
remembered the substance of these discourses, as spoken by Eleazar, and
so Josephus clothed them in his own words: at the lowest they contain
the Jewish notions on these heads, as understood then by our Josephus,
and cannot but deserve a suitable regard from us.]</p>
        <p>16 (return) [ See B. II. ch. 20. sect. 2, where the number of the slain
is but 10,000.]</p>
        <p>17 (return) [ Reland here sets down a parallel aphorism of one of
the Jewish Rabbins, &quot;We are born that we may die, and die that we may
live.&quot;]</p>
        <p>18 (return) [ Since Josephus here informs us that some of these Sicarii,
or ruffians, went from Alexandria [which was itself in Egypt, in a large
sense] into Egypt, and Thebes there situated, Reland well observes, from
Vossius, that Egypt sometimes denotes Proper or Upper Egypt, as distinct
from the Delta, and the lower parts near Palestine. Accordingly, as he
adds, those that say it never rains in Egypt must mean the Proper or
Upper Egypt, because it does sometimes rain in the other parts. See the
note on Antiq. B. II. ch. 7. sect. 7, and B. III. ch. 1. sect. 6.]</p>
        <p>19 (return) [ Of this temple of Onias&#x27;s building in Egypt, see the notes
on Antiq. B. XIII. ch. 3. sect. 1. But whereas it is elsewhere, both
of the War, B. I. ch. 1. sect. 1, and in the Antiquities as now quoted,
said that this temple was like to that at Jerusalem, and here that it
was not like it, but like a tower, sect. 3, there is some reason to
suspect the reading here, and that either the negative particle is here
to be blotted out, or the word entirely added.]</p>
        <p>20 (return) [ We must observe, that Josephus here speaks of Antiochus
who profaned the temple as now alive, when Onias had leave given them
by Philometer to build his temple; whereas it seems not to have been
actually built till about fifteen years afterwards. Yet, because it is
said in the Antiquities that Onias went to Philometer, B. XII. ch.
9. sect. 7, during the lifetime of that Antiochus, it is probable he
petitioned, and perhaps obtained his leave then, though it were not
actually built or finished till fifteen years afterward.]</p>
