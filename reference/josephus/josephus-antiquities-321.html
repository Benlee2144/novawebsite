Came To Him To Mount Sinai.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">Now when Raguel, Moses&#x27;s father-in-law, understood in what a prosperous
condition his affairs were, he willingly came to meet him and Moses and
his children, and pleased himself with his coming. And when he had
offered sacrifice, he made a feast for the multitude, near the Bush he
had formerly seen; which multitude, every one according to their
families, partook of the feast. But Aaron and his family took Raguel,
and sung hymns to God, as to Him who had been the author procurer of
their deliverance and their freedom. They also praised their conductor,
as him by whose virtue it was that all things had succeeded with them.
Raguel also, in his eucharistical oration to Moses, made great encomiums
upon the whole multitude; and he could not but admire Moses for his
fortitude, and that humanity he had shewn in the delivery of his
friends.</p>
