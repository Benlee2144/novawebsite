        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 3</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">How Great Disturbances Arose In Herods Family On His Preferring
Antipater His Eldest Son Before The Rest, Till Alexander Took That
Injury Very Heinously.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. But now the affairs in Herod&#x27;s family were in more and more disorder,
and became more severe upon him, by the hatred of Salome to the young
men [Alexander and Aristobulus], which descended as it were by
inheritance [from their mother Mariamne]; and as she had fully succeeded
against their mother, so she proceeded to that degree of madness and
insolence, as to endeavor that none of her posterity might be left
alive, who might have it in their power to revenge her death. The young
men had also somewhat of a bold and uneasy disposition towards their
father occasioned by the remembrance of what their mother had unjustly
suffered, and by their own affectation of dominion. The old grudge was
also renewed; and they cast reproaches on Salome and Pheroras, who
requited the young men with malicious designs, and actually laid
treacherous snares for them. Now as for this hatred, it was equal on
both sides, but the manner of exerting that hatred was different; for as
for the young men, they were rash, reproaching and affronting the others
openly, and were inexperienced enough to think it the most generous to
declare their minds in that undaunted manner; but the others did not
take that method, but made use of calumnies after a subtle and a
spiteful manner, still provoking the young men, and imagining that their
boldness might in time turn to the offering violence to their father;
for inasmuch as they were not ashamed of the pretended crimes of their
mother, nor thought she suffered justly, these supposed that might at
length exceed all bounds, and induce them to think they ought to be
avenged on their father, though it were by despatching him with their
own hands. At length it came to this, that the whole city was full of
their discourses, and, as is usual in such contests, the unskilfulness
of the young men was pitied; but the contrivance of Salome was too hard
for them, and what imputations she laid upon them came to be believed,
by means of their own conduct; for they who were so deeply affected with
the death of their mother, that while they said both she and themselves
were in a miserable case, they vehemently complained of her pitiable
end, which indeed was truly such, and said that they were themselves in
a pitiable case also, because they were forced to live with those that
had been her murderers, and to be partakers with them.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. These disorders increased greatly, and the king&#x27;s absence abroad had
afforded a fit opportunity for that increase; but as soon as Herod was
returned, and had made the forementioned speech to the multitude,
Pheroras and Salome let fill words immediately as if he were in great
danger, and as if the young men openly threatened that they would not
spare him any longer, but revenge their mother&#x27;s death upon him. They
also added another circumstance, that their hopes were fixed on
Archelaus, the king of Cappadocia, that they should be able by his means
to come to Cæsar, and accuse their father. Upon hearing such things,
Herod was immediately disturbed; and indeed was the more astonished,
because the same things were related to him by some others also. He then
called to mind his former calamity, and considered that the disorders in
his family had hindered him from enjoying any comfort from those that
were dearest to him or from his wife whom he loved so well; and
suspecting that his future troubles would soon be heavier and greater
than those that were past, he was in great confusion of mind; for Divine
Providence had in reality conferred upon him a great many outward
advantages for his happiness, even beyond his hopes; but the troubles he
had at home were such as he never expected to have met with, and
rendered him unfortunate; nay, both sorts came upon him to such a degree
as no one could imagine, and made it a doubtful question, whether, upon
the comparison of both, he ought to have exchanged so great a success of
outward good things for so great misfortunes at home, or whether he
ought not to have chosen to avoid the calamities relating to his family,
though he had, for a compensation, never been possessed of the admired
grandeur of a kingdom.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. As he was thus disturbed and afflicted, in order to depress these
young men, he brought to court another of his sons, that was born to him
when he was a private man; his name was Antipater; yet did he not then
indulge him as he did afterwards, when he was quite overcome by him, and
let him do every thing as he pleased, but rather with a design of
depressing the insolence of the sons of Mariamne, and managing this
elevation of his so, that it might be for a warning to them; for this
bold behavior of theirs [he thought] would not be so great, if they were
once persuaded that the succession to the kingdom did not appertain to
them alone, or must of necessity come to them. So he introduced
Antipater as their antagonist, and imagined that he made a good
provision for discouraging their pride, and that after this was done to
the young men, there might be a proper season for expecting these to be
of a better disposition; but the event proved otherwise than he
intended, for the young men thought he did them a very great injury; and
as Antipater was a shrewd man, when he had once obtained this degree of
freedom, and began to expect greater things than he had before hoped
for, he had but one single design in his head, and that was to distress
his brethren, and not at all to yield to them the pre-eminence, but to
keep close to his father, who was already alienated from them by the
calumnies he had heard about them, and ready to be wrought upon in any
way his zeal against them should advise him to pursue, that he might be
continually more and more severe against them. Accordingly, all the
reports that were spread abroad came from him, while he avoided himself
the suspicion as if those discoveries proceeded from him; but he rather
chose to make use of those persons for his assistants that were
unsuspected, and such as might be believed to speak truth by reason of
the good-will they bore to the king; and indeed there were already not a
few who cultivated a friendship with Antipater, in hopes of gaining
somewhat by him, and these were the men who most of all persuaded Herod,
because they appeared to speak thus out of their good-will to him: and
with these joint accusations, which from various foundations supported
one another&#x27;s veracity, the young men themselves afforded further
occasions to Antipater also; for they were observed to shed tears often,
on account of the injury that was offered them, and had their mother in
their mouths; and among their friends they ventured to reproach their
father, as not acting justly by them; all which things were with an evil
intention reserved in memory by Antipater against a proper opportunity;
and when they were told to Herod, with aggravations, increased the
disorder so much, that it brought a great tumult into the family; for
while the king was very angry at imputations that were laid upon the
sons of Mariamne, and was desirous to humble them, he still increased
the honor that he had bestowed on Antipater, and was at last so overcome
by his persuasions, that he brought his mother to court also. He also
wrote frequently to Cæsar in favor of him, and more earnestly
recommended him to his care particularly. And when Agrippa was returning
to Rome, after he had finished his ten years&#x27; government in Asia. 2
Herod sailed from Judea; and when he met with him, he had none with him
but Antipater, whom he delivered to Agrippa, that he might take him
along with him, together with many presents, that so he might become
Cæsar&#x27;s friend, insomuch that things already looked as if he had all his
father&#x27;s favor, and that the young men were already entirely rejected
from any hopes of the kingdom.</p>
