The Jewish Religion; And How Helena Supplied The Poor With Corn, When
There Was A Great Famine At Jerusalem.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. About this time it was that Helena, queen of Adiabene, and her son
Izates, changed their course of life, and embraced the Jewish customs,
and this on the occasion following: Monobazus, the king of Adiabene, who
had also the name of Bazeus, fell in love with his sister Helena, and
took her to be his wife, and begat her with child. But as he was in bed
with her one night, he laid his hand upon his wife&#x27;s belly, and fell
asleep, and seemed to hear a voice, which bid him take his hand off his
wife&#x27;s belly, and not hurt the infant that was therein, which, by God&#x27;s
providence, would be safely born, and have a happy end. This voice put
him into disorder; so he awaked immediately, and told the story to his
wife; and when his son was born, he called him Izates. He had indeed
Monobazus, his elder brother, by Helena also, as he had other sons by
other wives besides. Yet did he openly place all his affections on this
his only begotten 2 son Izates, which was the origin of that envy which
his other brethren, by the same father, bore to him; while on this
account they hated him more and more, and were all under great
affliction that their father should prefer Izates before them. Now
although their father was very sensible of these their passions, yet did
he forgive them, as not indulging those passions out of an ill
disposition, but out of a desire each of them had to be beloved by their
father. However, he sent Izates, with many presents, to Abennerig, the
king of Charax- Spasini, and that out of the great dread he was in about
him, lest he should come to some misfortune by the hatred his brethren
bore him; and he committed his son&#x27;s preservation to him. Upon which
Abennerig gladly received the young man, and had a great affection for
him, and married him to his own daughter, whose name was Samacha: he
also bestowed a country upon him, from which he received large revenues.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. But when Monobazus was grown old, and saw that he had but a little
time to live, he had a mind to come to the sight of his son before he
died. So he sent for him, and embraced him after the most affectionate
manner, and bestowed on him the country called Carra; it was a soil that
bare amomum in great plenty: there are also in it the remains of that
ark, wherein it is related that Noah escaped the deluge, and where they
are still shown to such as are desirous to see them. 3 Accordingly,
Izates abode in that country until his father&#x27;s death. But the very day
that Monobazus died, queen Helena sent for all the grandees, and
governors of the kingdom, and for those that had the armies committed to
their command; and when they were come, she made the following speech to
them: &quot;I believe you are not unacquainted that my husband was desirous
Izates should succeed him in the government, and thought him worthy so
to do. However, I wait your determination; for happy is he who receives
a kingdom, not from a single person only, but from the willing suffrages
of a great many.&quot; This she said, in order to try those that were
invited, and to discover their sentiments. Upon the hearing of which,
they first of all paid their homage to the queen, as their custom was,
and then they said that they confirmed the king&#x27;s determination, and
would submit to it; and they rejoiced that Izates&#x27;s father had preferred
him before the rest of his brethren, as being agreeable to all their
wishes: but that they were desirous first of all to slay his brethren
and kinsmen, that so the government might come securely to Izates;
because if they were once destroyed, all that fear would be over which
might arise from their hatred and envy to him. Helena replied to this,
that she returned them her thanks for their kindness to herself and to
Izates; but desired that they would however defer the execution of this
slaughter of Izates&#x27;s brethren till he should be there himself, and give
his approbation to it. So since these men had not prevailed with her,
when they advised her to slay them, they exhorted her at least to keep
them in bonds till he should come, and that for their own security; they
also gave her counsel to set up some one whom she could put the greatest
trust in, as a governor of the kingdom in the mean time. So queen Helena
complied with this counsel of theirs, and set up Monobazus, the eldest
son, to be king, and put the diadem upon his head, and gave him his
father&#x27;s ring, with its signet; as also the ornament which they call
Sampser, and exhorted him to administer the affairs of the kingdom till
his brother should come; who came suddenly upon hearing that his father
was dead, and succeeded his brother Monobazus, who resigned up the
government to him.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. Now, during the time Izates abode at Charax-Spasini, a certain Jewish
merchant, whose name was Ananias, got among the women that belonged to
the king, and taught them to worship God according to the Jewish
religion. He, moreover, by their means, became known to Izates, and
persuaded him, in like manner, to embrace that religion; he also, at the
earnest entreaty of Izates, accompanied him when he was sent for by his
father to come to Adiabene; it also happened that Helena, about the same
time, was instructed by a certain other Jew and went over to them. But
when Izates had taken the kingdom, and was come to Adiabene, and there
saw his brethren and other kinsmen in bonds, he was displeased at it;
and as he thought it an instance of impiety either to slay or imprison
them, but still thought it a hazardous thing for to let them have their
liberty, with the remembrance of the injuries that had been offered
them, he sent some of them and their children for hostages to Rome, to
Claudius Cæsar, and sent the others to Artabanus, the king of Parthia,
with the like intentions.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. And when he perceived that his mother was highly pleased with the
Jewish customs, he made haste to change, and to embrace them entirely;
and as he supposed that he could not be thoroughly a Jew unless he were
circumcised, he was ready to have it done. But when his mother
understood what he was about, she endeavored to hinder him from doing
it, and said to him that this thing would bring him into danger; and
that, as he was a king, he would thereby bring himself into great odium
among his subjects, when they should understand that he was so fond of
rites that were to them strange and foreign; and that they would never
bear to be ruled over by a Jew. This it was that she said to him, and
for the present persuaded him to forbear. And when he had related what
she had said to Ananias, he confirmed what his mother had said; and when
he had also threatened to leave him, unless he complied with him, he
went away from him, and said that he was afraid lest such an action
being once become public to all, he should himself be in danger of
punishment for having been the occasion of it, and having been the
king&#x27;s instructor in actions that were of ill reputation; and he said
that he might worship God without being circumcised, even though he did
resolve to follow the Jewish law entirely, which worship of God was of a
superior nature to circumcision. He added, that God would forgive him,
though he did not perform the operation, while it was omitted out of
necessity, and for fear of his subjects. So the king at that time
complied with these persuasions of Ananias. But afterwards, as he had
not quite left off his desire of doing this thing, a certain other Jew
that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar, and who was esteemed
very skillful in the learning of his country, persuaded him to do the
thing; for as he entered into his palace to salute him, and found him
reading the law of Moses, he said to him, &quot;Thou dost not consider, O
king! that thou unjustly breakest the principal of those laws, and art
injurious to God himself, [by omitting to be circumcised]; for thou
oughtest not only to read them, but chiefly to practice what they enjoin
thee. How long wilt thou continue uncircumcised? But if thou hast not
yet read the law about circumcision, and dost not know how great impiety
thou art guilty of by neglecting it, read it now.&quot; When the king had
heard what he said, he delayed the thing no longer, but retired to
another room, and sent for a surgeon, and did what he was commanded to
do. He then sent for his mother, and Ananias his tutor, and informed
them that he had done the thing; upon which they were presently struck
with astonishment and fear, and that to a great degree, lest the thing
should be openly discovered and censured, and the king should hazard the
loss of his kingdom, while his subjects would not bear to be governed by
a man who was so zealous in another religion; and lest they should
themselves run some hazard, because they would be supposed the occasion
of his so doing. But it was God himself who hindered what they feared
from taking effect; for he preserved both Izates himself and his sons
when they fell into many dangers, and procured their deliverance when it
seemed to be impossible, and demonstrated thereby that the fruit of
piety does not perish as to those that have regard to him, and fix their
faith upon him only. 4 But these events we shall relate hereafter.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">5. But as to Helena, the king&#x27;s mother, when she saw that the affairs of
Izates&#x27;s kingdom were in peace, and that her son was a happy man, and
admired among all men, and even among foreigners, by the means of God&#x27;s
providence over him, she had a mind to go to the city of Jerusalem, in
order to worship at that temple of God which was so very famous among
all men, and to offer her thank-offerings there. So she desired her son
to give her leave to go thither; upon which he gave his consent to what
she desired very willingly, and made great preparations for her
dismission, and gave her a great deal of money, and she went down to the
city Jerusalem, her son conducting her on her journey a great way. Now
her coming was of very great advantage to the people of Jerusalem; for
whereas a famine did oppress them at that time, and many people died for
want of what was necessary to procure food withal, queen Helena sent
some of her servants to Alexandria with money to buy a great quantity of
corn, and others of them to Cyprus, to bring a cargo of dried figs. And
as soon as they were come back, and had brought those provisions, which
was done very quickly, she distributed food to those that were in want
of it, and left a most excellent memorial behind her of this
benefaction, which she bestowed on our whole nation. And when her son
Izates was informed of this famine, 5 he sent great sums of money to the
principal men in Jerusalem. However, what favors this queen and king
conferred upon our city Jerusalem shall be further related hereafter.</p>
