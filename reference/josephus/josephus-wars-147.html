        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">The Jews Fight A Great Battle With Sabinus&#x27;s Soldiers, And A
     Great Destruction Is Made At Jerusalem.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now before Caesar had determined any thing about these affairs,
Malthace, Arehelaus&#x27;s mother, fell sick and died. Letters also were
brought out of Syria from Varus, about a revolt of the Jews. This was
foreseen by Varus, who accordingly, after Archelaus was sailed, went
up to Jerusalem to restrain the promoters of the sedition, since it was
manifest that the nation would not be at rest; so he left one of those
legions which he brought with him out of Syria in the city, and went
himself to Antioch. But Sabinus came, after he was gone, and gave them
an occasion of making innovations; for he compelled the keepers of the
citadels to deliver them up to him, and made a bitter search after the
king&#x27;s money, as depending not only on the soldiers which were left by
Varus, but on the multitude of his own servants, all which he armed and
used as the instruments of his covetousness. Now when that feast, which
was observed after seven weeks, and which the Jews called Pentecost, [i.
e. the 50th day,] was at hand, its name being taken from the number
of the days [after the passover], the people got together, but not on
account of the accustomed Divine worship, but of the indignation they
had [&#x27;at the present state of affairs&#x27;]. Wherefore an immense multitude
ran together, out of Galilee, and Idumea, and Jericho, and Perea, that
was beyond Jordan; but the people that naturally belonged to Judea
itself were above the rest, both in number, and in the alacrity of the
men. So they distributed themselves into three parts, and pitched their
camps in three places; one at the north side of the temple, another at
the south side, by the Hippodrome, and the third part were at the palace
on the west. So they lay round about the Romans on every side, and
besieged them.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. Now Sabinus was affrighted, both at their multitude, and at their
courage, and sent messengers to Varus continually, and besought him to
come to his succor quickly; for that if he delayed, his legion would be
cut to pieces. As for Sabinus himself, he got up to the highest tower
of the fortress, which was called Phasaelus; it is of the same name with
Herod&#x27;s brother, who was destroyed by the Parthians; and then he made
signs to the soldiers of that legion to attack the enemy; for his
astonishment was so great, that he durst not go down to his own men.
Hereupon the soldiers were prevailed upon, and leaped out into the
temple, and fought a terrible battle with the Jews; in which, while
there were none over their heads to distress them, they were too hard
for them, by their skill, and the others&#x27; want of skill, in war; but
when once many of the Jews had gotten up to the top of the cloisters,
and threw their darts downwards, upon the heads of the Romans,
there were a great many of them destroyed. Nor was it easy to avenge
themselves upon those that threw their weapons from on high, nor was it
more easy for them to sustain those who came to fight them hand to hand.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. Since therefore the Romans were sorely afflicted by both these
circumstances, they set fire to the cloisters, which were works to be
admired, both on account of their magnitude and costliness. Whereupon
those that were above them were presently encompassed with the flame,
and many of them perished therein; as many of them also were destroyed
by the enemy, who came suddenly upon them; some of them also threw
themselves down from the walls backward, and some there were who, from
the desperate condition they were in, prevented the fire, by killing
themselves with their own swords; but so many of them as crept out from
the walls, and came upon the Romans, were easily mastered by them, by
reason of the astonishment they were under; until at last some of the
Jews being destroyed, and others dispersed by the terror they were in,
the soldiers fell upon the treasure of God, which was now deserted, and
plundered about four hundred talents, Of which sum Sabinus got together
all that was not carried away by the soldiers.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. However, this destruction of the works [about the temple], and of the
men, occasioned a much greater number, and those of a more warlike sort,
to get together, to oppose the Romans. These encompassed the palace
round, and threatened to deploy all that were in it, unless they went
their ways quickly; for they promised that Sabinus should come to no
harm, if he would go out with his legion. There were also a great many
of the king&#x27;s party who deserted the Romans, and assisted the Jews; yet
did the most warlike body of them all, who were three thousand of the
men of Sebaste, go over to the Romans. Rufus also, and Gratus, their
captains, did the same, [Gratus having the foot of the king&#x27;s party
under him, and Rufus the horse,] each of whom, even without the forces
under them, were of great weight, on account of their strength and
wisdom, which turn the scales in war. Now the Jews in the siege, and
tried to break down walls of the fortress, and cried out to Sabinus and
his party, that they should go their ways, and not prove a hinderance to
them, now they hoped, after a long time, to recover that ancient liberty
which their forefathers had enjoyed. Sabinus indeed was well contented
to get out of the danger he was in, but he distrusted the assurances the
Jews gave him, and suspected such gentle treatment was but a bait laid
as a snare for them: this consideration, together with the hopes he had
of succor from Varus, made him bear the siege still longer.</p>
