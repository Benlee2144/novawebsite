        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">Placidus Attempts To Take Jotapata And Is Beaten Off.
     Vespasian Marches Into Galilee.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. And now Vespasian, with his son Titus, had tarried some time at
Ptolemais, and had put his army in order. But when Placidus, who had
overrun Galilee, and had besides slain a number of those whom he had
caught, [which were only the weaker part of the Galileans, and such
as were of timorous souls,] saw that the warriors ran always to those
cities whose walls had been built by Josephus, he marched furiously
against Jotapata, which was of them all the strongest, as supposing he
should easily take it by a sudden surprise, and that he should thereby
obtain great honor to himself among the commanders, and bring a great
advantage to them in their future campaign; because if this strongest
place of them all were once taken, the rest would be so affrighted as to
surrender themselves. But he was mightily mistaken in his undertaking;
for the men of Jotapata were apprized of his coming to attack them, and
came out of the city, and expected him there. So they fought the Romans
briskly when they least expected it, being both many in number, and
prepared for fighting, and of great alacrity, as esteeming their
country, their wives, and their children to be in danger, and easily put
the Romans to flight, and wounded many of them, and slew seven of them;
4 because their retreat was not made in a disorderly manner, because
the strokes only touched the surface of their bodies, which were covered
with their armor in all parts, and because the Jews did rather throw
their weapons upon them from a great distance, than venture to come hand
to hand with them, and had only light armor on, while the others were
completely armed. However, three men of the Jews&#x27; side were slain, and
a few wounded; so Placidus, finding himself unable to assault the city,
ran away.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. But as Vespasian had a great mind to fall upon Galilee, he marched
out of Ptolemais, having put his army into that order wherein the Romans
used to march. He ordered those auxiliaries which were lightly armed,
and the archers, to march first, that they might prevent any sudden
insults from the enemy, and might search out the woods that looked
suspiciously, and were capable of ambuscades. Next to these followed
that part of the Romans which was completely armed, both footmen and
horsemen. Next to these followed ten out of every hundred, carrying
along with them their arms, and what was necessary to measure out a camp
withal; and after them, such as were to make the road even and straight,
and if it were any where rough and hard to be passed over, to plane it,
and to cut down the woods that hindered their march, that the army might
not be in distress, or tired with their march. Behind these he set
such carriages of the army as belonged both to himself and to the other
commanders, with a considerable number of their horsemen for their
security. After these he marched himself, having with him a select body
of footmen, and horsemen, and pikemen. After these came the peculiar
cavalry of his own legion, for there were a hundred and twenty horsemen
that peculiarly belonged to every legion. Next to these came the mules
that carried the engines for sieges, and the other warlike machines
of that nature. After these came the commanders of the cohorts and
tribunes, having about them soldiers chosen out of the rest. Then came
the ensigns encompassing the eagle, which is at the head of every Roman
legion, the king, and the strongest of all birds, which seems to them a
signal of dominion, and an omen that they shall conquer all against whom
they march; these sacred ensigns are followed by the trumpeters. Then
came the main army in their squadrons and battalions, with six men in
depth, which were followed at last by a centurion, who, according to
custom, observed the rest. As for the servants of every legion, they
all followed the footmen, and led the baggage of the soldiers, which
was borne by the mules and other beasts of burden. But behind all the
legions came the whole multitude of the mercenaries; and those that
brought up the rear came last of all for the security of the whole army,
being both footmen, and those in their armor also, with a great number
of horsemen.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. And thus did Vespasian march with his army, and came to the bounds of
Galilee, where he pitched his camp and restrained his soldiers, who
were eager for war; he also showed his army to the enemy, in order
to affright them, and to afford them a season for repentance, to see
whether they would change their minds before it came to a battle, and at
the same time he got things ready for besieging their strong minds. And
indeed this sight of the general brought many to repent of their revolt,
and put them all into a consternation; for those that were in Josephus&#x27;s
camp, which was at the city called Garis, not far from Sepphoris, when
they heard that the war was come near them, and that the Romans would
suddenly fight them hand to hand, dispersed themselves and fled, not
only before they came to a battle, but before the enemy ever came in
sight, while Josephus and a few others were left behind; and as he saw
that he had not an army sufficient to engage the enemy, that the spirits
of the Jews were sunk, and that the greater part would willingly come to
terms, if they might be credited, he already despaired of the success of
the whole war, and determined to get as far as he possibly could out
of danger; so he took those that staid along with him, and fled to
Tiberias.</p>
