        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 9. How Amaziah Made An Expedition Against The Edomites And
Amalekites And Conquered Them; But When He Afterwards Made War Against
Joash, He Was Beaten And Not Long After Was Slain, And Uzziah Succeeded
In The Government.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now, in the second year of the reign of Joash over Israel, Amaziah
reigned over the tribe of Judah in Jerusalem. His mother&#x27;s name was
Jehoaddan, who was born at Jerusalem. He was exceeding careful of doing
what was right, and this when he was very young; but when he came to the
management of affairs, and to the government, he resolved that he ought
first of all to avenge his father Je-hoash, and to punish those his
friends that had laid violent hands upon him: so he seized upon them
all, and put them to death; yet did he execute no severity on their
children, but acted therein according to the laws of Moses, who did not
think it just to punish children for the sins of their fathers. After
this he chose him an army out of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, of
such as were in the flower of their age, and about twenty years old; and
when he had collected about three hundred thousand of them together, he
set captains of hundreds over them. He also sent to the king of Israel,
and hired a hundred thousand of his soldiers for a hundred talents of
silver, for he had resolved to make an expedition against the nations of
the Amalekites, and Edomites, and Gebalites: but as he was preparing for
his expedition, and ready to go out to the war, a prophet gave him
counsel to dismiss the army of the Israelites, because they were bad
men, and because God foretold that he should be beaten, if he made use
of them as auxiliaries; but that he should overcome his enemies, though
he had but a few soldiers, when it so pleased God. And when the king
grudged at his having already paid the hire of the Israelites, the
prophet exhorted him to do what God would have him, because he should
thereby obtain much wealth from God. So he dismissed them, and said that
he still freely gave them their pay, and went himself with his own army,
and made war with the nations before mentioned; and when he had beaten
them in battle, he slew of them ten thousand, and took as many prisoners
alive, whom he brought to the great rock which is in Arabia, and threw
them down from it headlong. He also brought away a great deal of prey
and vast riches from those nations. But while Amaziah was engaged in
this expedition, those Israelites whom he had hired, and then dismissed,
were very uneasy at it, and taking their dismission for an affront, [as
supposing that this would not have been done to them but out of
contempt,] they fell upon his kingdom, and proceeded to spoil the
country as far as Beth- horon, and took much cattle, and slew three
thousand men.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. Now upon the victory which Amaziah had gotten, and the great acts he
had done, he was puffed up, and began to overlook God, who had given him
the victory, and proceeded to worship the gods he had brought out of the
country of the Amalekites. So a prophet came to him, and said, that he
wondered how he could esteem these to be gods, who had been of no
advantage to their own people who paid them honors, nor had delivered
them from his hands, but had overlooked the destruction of many of them,
and had suffered themselves to be carried captive, for that they had
been carried to Jerusalem in the same manner as any one might have taken
some of the enemy alive, and led them thither. This reproof provoked the
king to anger, and he commanded the prophet to hold his peace, and
threatened to punish him if he meddled with his conduct. So he replied,
that he should indeed hold his peace; but foretold withal, that God
would not overlook his attempts for innovation. But Amaziah was not able
to contain himself under that prosperity which God had given him,
although he had affronted God thereupon; but in a vein of insolence he
wrote to Joash, the king of Israel, and commanded that he and all his
people should be obedient to him, as they had formerly been obedient to
his progenitors, David and Solomon; and he let him know, that if he
would not be so wise as to do what he commanded him, he must fight for
his dominion. To which message Joash returned this answer in writing:
&quot;King Joash to king Amaziah. There was a vastly tall cypress tree in
Mount Lebanon, as also a thistle; this thistle sent to the cypress tree
to give the cypress tree&#x27;s daughter in marriage to the thistle&#x27;s son;
but as the thistle was saying this, there came a wild beast, and trod
down the thistle: and this may be a lesson to thee, not to be so
ambitious, and to have a care, lest upon thy good success in the fight
against the Amalekites thou growest so proud, as to bring dangers upon
thyself and upon thy kingdom.&quot;</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. When Amaziah had read this letter, he was more eager upon this
expedition, which, I suppose, was by the impulse of God, that he might
be punished for his offense against him. But as soon as he led out his
army against Joash, and they were going to join battle with him, there
came such a fear and consternation upon the army of Amaziah, as God,
when he is displeased, sends upon men, and discomfited them, even before
they came to a close fight. Now it happened, that as they were scattered
about by the terror that was upon them, Amaziah was left alone, and was
taken prisoner by the enemy; whereupon Joash threatened to kill him,
unless he would persuade the people of Jerusalem to open their gates to
him, and receive him and his army into the city. Accordingly Amaziah was
so distressed, and in such fear of his life, that he made his enemy to
be received into the city. So Joash over threw a part of the wall, of
the length of four hundred cubits, and drove his chariot through the
breach into Jerusalem, and led Amaziah captive along with him; by which
means he became master of Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of God,
and carried off all the gold and silver that was in the king&#x27;s palace,
and then freed the king from captivity, and returned to Samaria. Now
these things happened to the people of Jerusalem in the fourteenth year
of the reign of Amaziah, who after this had a conspiracy made against
him by his friends, and fled to the city Lachish, and was there slain by
the conspirators, who sent men thither to kill him. So they took up his
dead body, and carried it to Jerusalem, and made a royal funeral for
him. This was the end of the life of Amaziah, because of his innovations
in religion, and his contempt of God, when he had lived fifty-four
years, and had reigned twenty-nine. He was succeeded by his son, whose
name was Uzziah.</p>
