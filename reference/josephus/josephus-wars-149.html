        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">Varus Composes The Tumults In Judea And Crucifies About Two
     Thousand Of The Seditious.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Upon Varus&#x27;s reception of the letters that were written by Sabinus
and the captains, he could not avoid being afraid for the whole legion
[he had left there]. So he made haste to their relief, and took with
him the other two legions, with the four troops of horsemen to them
belonging, and marched to Ptolenlais; having given orders for the
auxiliaries that were sent by the kings and governors of cities to
meet him there. Moreover, he received from the people of Berytus, as he
passed through their city, fifteen hundred armed men. Now as soon as the
other body of auxiliaries were come to Ptolemais, as well as Aretas the
Arabian, [who, out of the hatred he bore to Herod, brought a great army
of horse and foot,] Varus sent a part of his army presently to Galilee,
which lay near to Ptolemais, and Caius, one of his friends, for their
captain. This Caius put those that met him to flight, and took the city
Sepphoris, and burnt it, and made slaves of its inhabitants; but as for
Varus himself, he marched to Samaria with his whole army, where he did
not meddle with the city itself, because he found that it had made no
commotion during these troubles, but pitched his camp about a certain
village which was called Aras. It belonged to Ptolemy, and on that
account was plundered by the Arabians, who were very angry even at
Herod&#x27;s friends also. He thence marched on to the village Sampho,
another fortified place, which they plundered, as they had done the
other. As they carried off all the money they lighted upon belonging
to the public revenues, all was now full of fire and blood-shed, and
nothing could resist the plunders of the Arabians. Emnaus was also
burnt, upon the flight of its inhabitants, and this at the command of
Varus, out of his rage at the slaughter of those that were about Arias.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. Thence he marched on to Jerusalem, and as soon as he was but seen by
the Jews, he made their camps disperse themselves; they also went away,
and fled up and down the country. But the citizens received him, and
cleared themselves of having any hand in this revolt, and said that
they had raised no commotions, but had only been forced to admit the
multitude, because of the festival, and that they were rather besieged
together with the Romans, than assisted those that had revolted. There
had before this met him Joseph, the first cousin of Archelaus, and
Gratus, together with Rufus, who led those of Sebaste, as well as the
king&#x27;s army: there also met him those of the Roman legion, armed after
their accustomed manner; for as to Sabinus, he durst not come into
Varus&#x27;s sight, but was gone out of the city before this, to the
sea-side. But Varus sent a part of his army into the country, against
those that had been the authors of this commotion, and as they caught
great numbers of them, those that appeared to have been the least
concerned in these tumults he put into custody, but such as were the
most guilty he crucified; these were in number about two thousand.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. He was also informed that there continued in Idumea ten thousand
men still in arms; but when he found that the Arabians did not act like
auxiliaries, but managed the war according to their own passions, and
did mischief to the country otherwise than he intended, and this out of
their hatred to Herod, he sent them away, but made haste, with his own
legions, to march against those that had revolted; but these, by the
advice of Achiabus, delivered themselves up to him before it came to a
battle. Then did Varus forgive the multitude their offenses, but sent
their captains to Caesar to be examined by him. Now Caesar forgave the
rest, but gave orders that certain of the king&#x27;s relations [for some of
those that were among them were Herod&#x27;s kinsmen] should be put to death,
because they had engaged in a war against a king of their own family.
When therefore Varus had settled matters at Jerusalem after this manner,
and had left the former legion there as a garrison, he returned to
Antioch.</p>
