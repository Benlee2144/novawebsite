        <p>The Cruelty Of The Idumeans When They Were Gotten Into The
     Temple During The Storm; And Of The Zealots. Concerning The
     Slaughter Of Ananus, And Jesus, And Zacharias; And How The
     Idumeans Retired Home.</p>
        <p>1. This advice pleased the Idumeans, and they ascended through the
city to the temple. The zealots were also in great expectation of
their coming, and earnestly waited for them. When therefore these were
entering, they also came boldly out of the inner temple, and mixing
themselves among the Idumeans, they attacked the guards; and some of
those that were upon the watch, but were fallen asleep, they killed as
they were asleep; but as those that were now awakened made a cry, the
whole multitude arose, and in the amazement they were in caught hold of
their arms immediately, and betook themselves to their own defense; and
so long as they thought they were only the zealots who attacked them,
they went on boldly, as hoping to overpower them by their numbers; but
when they saw others pressing in upon them also, they perceived the
Idumeans were got in; and the greatest part of them laid aside
their arms, together with their courage, and betook themselves to
lamentations. But some few of the younger sort covered themselves
with their armor, and valiantly received the Idumeans, and for a while
protected the multitude of old men. Others, indeed, gave a signal to
those that were in the city of the calamities they were in; but when
these were also made sensible that the Idumeans were come in, none of
them durst come to their assistance, only they returned the terrible
echo of wailing, and lamented their misfortunes. A great howling of the
women was excited also, and every one of the guards were in danger
of being killed. The zealots also joined in the shouts raised by the
Idumeans; and the storm itself rendered the cry more terrible; nor did
the Idumeans spare any body; for as they are naturally a most barbarous
and bloody nation, and had been distressed by the tempest, they made use
of their weapons against those that had shut the gates against them, and
acted in the same manner as to those that supplicated for their lives,
and to those that fought them, insomuch that they ran through those with
their swords who desired them to remember the relation there was between
them, and begged of them to have regard to their common temple. Now
there was at present neither any place for flight, nor any hope of
preservation; but as they were driven one upon another in heaps, so
were they slain. Thus the greater part were driven together by force, as
there was now no place of retirement, and the murderers were upon them;
and, having no other way, threw themselves down headlong into the city;
whereby, in my opinion, they underwent a more miserable destruction than
that which they avoided, because that was a voluntary one. And now the
outer temple was all of it overflowed with blood; and that day, as it
came on, they saw eight thousand five hundred dead bodies there.</p>
        <p>2. But the rage of the Idumeans was not satiated by these slaughters;
but they now betook themselves to the city, and plundered every house,
and slew every one they met; and for the other multitude, they esteemed
it needless to go on with killing them, but they sought for the high
priests, and the generality went with the greatest zeal against them;
and as soon as they caught them they slew them, and then standing upon
their dead bodies, in way of jest, upbraided Ananus with his kindness to
the people, and Jesus with his speech made to them from the wall. Nay,
they proceeded to that degree of impiety, as to cast away their dead
bodies without burial, although the Jews used to take so much care of
the burial of men, that they took down those that were condemned and
crucified, and buried them before the going down of the sun. I should
not mistake if I said that the death of Ananus was the beginning of the
destruction of the city, and that from this very day may be dated the
overthrow of her wall, and the ruin of her affairs, whereon they saw
their high priest, and the procurer of their preservation, slain in the
midst of their city. He was on other accounts also a venerable, and a
very just man; and besides the grandeur of that nobility, and dignity,
and honor of which he was possessed, he had been a lover of a kind
of parity, even with regard to the meanest of the people; he was
a prodigious lover of liberty, and an admirer of a democracy in
government; and did ever prefer the public welfare before his own
advantage, and preferred peace above all things; for he was thoroughly
sensible that the Romans were not to be conquered. He also foresaw
that of necessity a war would follow, and that unless the Jews made up
matters with them very dexterously, they would be destroyed; to say
all in a word, if Ananus had survived, they had certainly compounded
matters; for he was a shrewd man in speaking and persuading the people,
and had already gotten the mastery of those that opposed his designs, or
were for the war. And the Jews had then put abundance of delays in the
way of the Romans, if they had had such a general as he was. Jesus
was also joined with him; and although he was inferior to him upon the
comparison, he was superior to the rest; and I cannot but think that it
was because God had doomed this city to destruction, as a polluted city,
and was resolved to purge his sanctuary by fire, that he cut off these
their great defenders and well-wishers, while those that a little before
had worn the sacred garments, and had presided over the public worship;
and had been esteemed venerable by those that dwelt on the whole
habitable earth when they came into our city, were cast out naked, and
seen to be the food of dogs and wild beasts. And I cannot but imagine
that virtue itself groaned at these men&#x27;s case, and lamented that she
was here so terribly conquered by wickedness. And this at last was the
end of Ananus and Jesus.</p>
        <p>3. Now after these were slain, the zealots and the multitude of the
Idumeans fell upon the people as upon a flock of profane animals, and
cut their throats; and for the ordinary sort, they were destroyed in
what place soever they caught them. But for the noblemen and the youth,
they first caught them and bound them, and shut them up in prison, and
put off their slaughter, in hopes that some of them would turn over to
their party; but not one of them would comply with their desires, but
all of them preferred death before being enrolled among such wicked
wretches as acted against their own country. But this refusal of theirs
brought upon them terrible torments; for they were so scourged and
tortured, that their bodies were not able to sustain their torments,
till at length, and with difficulty, they had the favor to be slain.
Those whom they caught in the day time were slain in the night, and then
their bodies were carried out and thrown away, that there might be room
for other prisoners; and the terror that was upon the people was so
great, that no one had courage enough either to weep openly for the dead
man that was related to him, or to bury him; but those that were shut up
in their own houses could only shed tears in secret, and durst not even
groan without great caution, lest any of their enemies should hear them;
for if they did, those that mourned for others soon underwent the same
death with those whom they mourned for. Only in the night time they
would take up a little dust, and throw it upon their bodies; and even
some that were the most ready to expose themselves to danger would do it
in the day time: and there were twelve thousand of the better sort who
perished in this manner.</p>
        <p>4. And now these zealots and Idumeans were quite weary of barely killing
men, so they had the impudence of setting up fictitious tribunals and
judicatures for that purpose; and as they intended to have Zacharias 9
the son of Baruch, one of the most eminent of the citizens, slain, so
what provoked them against him was, that hatred of wickedness and love
of liberty which were so eminent in him: he was also a rich man, so that
by taking him off, they did not only hope to seize his effects, but
also to get rid of a mall that had great power to destroy them. So they
called together, by a public proclamation, seventy of the principal men
of the populace, for a show, as if they were real judges, while they had
no proper authority. Before these was Zacharias accused of a design
to betray their polity to the Romans, and having traitorously sent to
Vespasian for that purpose. Now there appeared no proof or sign of
what he was accused; but they affirmed themselves that they were well
persuaded that so it was, and desired that such their affirmation might
be taken for sufficient evidence. Now when Zacharias clearly saw that
there was no way remaining for his escape from them, as having been
treacherously called before them, and then put in prison, but not with
any intention of a legal trial, he took great liberty of speech in that
despair of his life he was under. Accordingly he stood up, and laughed
at their pretended accusation, and in a few words confuted the crimes
laid to his charge; after which he turned his speech to his accusers,
and went over distinctly all their transgressions of the law, and made
heavy lamentation upon the confusion they had brought public affairs
to: in the mean time, the zealots grew tumultuous, and had much ado to
abstain from drawing their swords, although they designed to preserve
the appearance and show of judicature to the end. They were also
desirous, on other accounts, to try the judges, whether they would be
mindful of what was just at their own peril. Now the seventy judges
brought in their verdict that the person accused was not guilty, as
choosing rather to die themselves with him, than to have his death laid
at their doors; hereupon there arose a great clamor of the zealots
upon his acquittal, and they all had indignation at the judges for not
understanding that the authority that was given them was but in jest.
So two of the boldest of them fell upon Zacharias in the middle of the
temple, and slew him; and as he fell down dead, they bantered him,
and said, &quot;Thou hast also our verdict, and this will prove a more sure
acquittal to thee than the other.&quot; They also threw him down from the
temple immediately into the valley beneath it. Moreover, they struck the
judges with the backs of their swords, by way of abuse, and thrust them
out of the court of the temple, and spared their lives with no other
design than that, when they were dispersed among the people in the city,
they might become their messengers, to let them know they were no better
than slaves.</p>
        <p>5. But by this time the Idumeans repented of their coming, and were
displeased at what had been done; and when they were assembled together
by one of the zealots, who had come privately to them, he declared
to them what a number of wicked pranks they had themselves done in
conjunction with those that invited them, and gave a particular account
of what mischiefs had been done against their metropolis. He said that
they had taken arms, as though the high priests were betraying their
metropolis to the Romans, but had found no indication of any such
treachery; but that they had succored those that had pretended to
believe such a thing, while they did themselves the works of war and
tyranny, after an insolent manner. It had been indeed their business to
have hindered them from such their proceedings at the first, but seeing
they had once been partners with them in shedding the blood of their
own countrymen, it was high time to put a stop to such crimes, and not
continue to afford any more assistance to such as are subverting the
laws of their forefathers; for that if any had taken it ill that the
gates had been shut against them, and they had not been permitted to
come into the city, yet that those who had excluded them have been
punished, and Ananus is dead, and that almost all those people had been
destroyed in one night&#x27;s time. That one may perceive many of themselves
now repenting for what they had done, and might see the horrid barbarity
of those that had invited them, and that they had no regard to such as
had saved them; that they were so impudent as to perpetrate the vilest
things, under the eyes of those that had supported them, and that their
wicked actions would be laid to the charge of the Idumeans, and would
be so laid to their charge till somebody obstructs their proceedings, or
separates himself from the same wicked action; that they therefore ought
to retire home, since the imputation of treason appears to be a Calumny,
and that there was no expectation of the coming of the Romans at this
time, and that the government of the city was secured by such walls as
cannot easily be thrown down; and, by avoiding any further fellowship
with these bad men, to make some excuse for themselves, as to what they
had been so far deluded, as to have been partners with them hitherto.</p>
        <p>CHAPTER 6.</p>
        <p>How The Zealots When They Were Freed From The Idumeans, Slew
     A Great Many More Of The Citizens; And How Vespasian
     Dissuaded The Romans When They Were Very Earnest To March
     Against The Jews From Proceeding In The War At That Time.</p>
        <p>1. The Idumeans complied with these persuasions; and, in the first
place, they set those that were in the prisons at liberty, being about
two thousand of the populace, who thereupon fled away immediately to
Simon, one whom we shall speak of presently. After which these Idumeans
retired from Jerusalem, and went home; which departure of theirs was
a great surprise to both parties; for the people, not knowing of their
repentance, pulled up their courage for a while, as eased of so many of
their enemies, while the zealots grew more insolent not as deserted by
their confederates, but as freed from such men as might hinder their
designs, and plot some stop to their wickedness. Accordingly, they
made no longer any delay, nor took any deliberation in their enormous
practices, but made use of the shortest methods for all their executions
and what they had once resolved upon, they put in practice sooner than
any one could imagine. But their thirst was chiefly after the blood
of valiant men, and men of good families; the one sort of which they
destroyed out of envy, the other out of fear; for they thought their
whole security lay in leaving no potent men alive; on which account they
slew Gorion, a person eminent in dignity, and on account of his family
also; he was also for democracy, and of as great boldness and freedom
of spirit as were any of the Jews whosoever; the principal thing that
ruined him, added to his other advantages, was his free speaking. Nor
did Niger of Peres escape their hands; he had been a man of great valor
in their war with the Romans, but was now drawn through the middle of
the city, and, as he went, he frequently cried out, and showed the scars
of his wounds; and when he was drawn out of the gates, and despaired of
his preservation, he besought them to grant him a burial; but as they
had threatened him beforehand not to grant him any spot of earth for a
grave, which he chiefly desired of them, so did they slay him [without
permitting him to be buried]. Now when they were slaying him, he made
this imprecation upon them, that they might undergo both famine and
pestilence in this war, and besides all that, they might come to the
mutual slaughter of one another; all which imprecations God confirmed
against these impious men, and was what came most justly upon them,
when not long afterward they tasted of their own madness in their mutual
seditions one against another. So when this Niger was killed, their
fears of being overturned were diminished; and indeed there was no part
of the people but they found out some pretense to destroy them; for
some were therefore slain, because they had had differences with some of
them; and as to those that had not opposed them in times of peace, they
watched seasonable opportunities to gain some accusation against
them; and if any one did not come near them at all, he was under their
suspicion as a proud man; if any one came with boldness, he was esteemed
a contemner of them; and if any one came as aiming to oblige them, he
was supposed to have some treacherous plot against them; while the only
punishment of crimes, whether they were of the greatest or smallest
sort, was death. Nor could any one escape, unless he were very
inconsiderable, either on account of the meanness of his birth, or on
account of his fortune.</p>
        <p>2. And now all the rest of the commanders of the Romans deemed this
sedition among their enemies to be of great advantage to them, and were
very earnest to march to the city, and they urged Vespasian, as their
lord and general in all cases, to make haste, and said to him, that &quot;the
providence of God is on our side, by setting our enemies at variance
against one another; that still the change in such cases may be sudden,
and the Jews may quickly be at one again, either because they may be
tired out with their civil miseries, or repent them of such doings.&quot; But
Vespasian replied, that they were greatly mistaken in what they thought
fit to be done, as those that, upon the theater, love to make a show
of their hands, and of their weapons, but do it at their own hazard,
without considering, what was for their advantage, and for their
security; for that if they now go and attack the city immediately, &quot;they
shall but occasion their enemies to unite together, and shall convert
their force, now it is in its height, against themselves. But if they
stay a while, they shall have fewer enemies, because they will be
consumed in this sedition: that God acts as a general of the Romans
better than he can do, and is giving the Jews up to them without any
pains of their own, and granting their army a victory without any
danger; that therefore it is their best way, while their enemies
are destroying each other with their own hands, and falling into the
greatest of misfortunes, which is that of sedition, to sit still as
spectators of the dangers they run into, rather than to fight hand to
hand with men that love murdering, and are mad one against another. But
if any one imagines that the glory of victory, when it is gotten without
fighting, will be more insipid, let him know this much, that a glorious
success, quietly obtained, is more profitable than the dangers of
a battle; for we ought to esteem these that do what is agreeable to
temperance and prudence no less glorious than those that have gained
great reputation by their actions in war: that he shall lead on his army
with greater force when their enemies are diminished, and his own army
refreshed after the continual labors they had undergone. However, that
this is not a proper time to propose to ourselves the glory of victory;
for that the Jews are not now employed in making of armor or building of
walls, nor indeed in getting together auxiliaries, while the advantage
will be on their side who give them such opportunity of delay; but
that the Jews are vexed to pieces every day by their civil wars and
dissensions, and are under greater miseries than, if they were once
taken, could be inflicted on them by us. Whether therefore any one
hath regard to what is for our safety, he ought to suffer these Jews to
destroy one another; or whether he hath regard to the greater glory of
the action, we ought by no means to meddle with those men, now they are
afflicted with a distemper at home; for should we now conquer them, it
would be said the conquest was not owing to our bravery, but to their
sedition.&quot; 10</p>
        <p>3. And now the commanders joined in their approbation of what Vespasian
had said, and it was soon discovered how wise an opinion he had given.
And indeed many there were of the Jews that deserted every day, and fled
away from the zealots, although their flight was very difficult, since
they had guarded every passage out of the city, and slew every one that
was caught at them, as taking it for granted they were going over to the
Romans; yet did he who gave them money get clear off, while he only that
gave them none was voted a traitor. So the upshot was this, that the
rich purchased their flight by money, while none but the poor were
slain. Along all the roads also vast numbers of dead bodies lay in
heaps, and even many of those that were so zealous in deserting at
length chose rather to perish within the city; for the hopes of burial
made death in their own city appear of the two less terrible to them.
But these zealots came at last to that degree of barbarity, as not to
bestow a burial either on those slain in the city, or on those that lay
along the roads; but as if they had made an agreement to cancel both the
laws of their country and the laws of nature, and, at the same time
that they defiled men with their wicked actions, they would pollute the
Divinity itself also, they left the dead bodies to putrefy under the
sun; and the same punishment was allotted to such as buried any as
to those that deserted, which was no other than death; while he that
granted the favor of a grave to another would presently stand in need
of a grave himself. To say all in a word, no other gentle passion was so
entirely lost among them as mercy; for what were the greatest objects of
pity did most of all irritate these wretches, and they transferred their
rage from the living to those that had been slain, and from the dead
to the living. Nay, the terror was so very great, that he who survived
called them that were first dead happy, as being at rest already; as did
those that were under torture in the prisons, declare, that, upon
this comparison, those that lay unburied were the happiest. These men,
therefore, trampled upon all the laws of men, and laughed at the laws
of God; and for the oracles of the prophets, they ridiculed them as
the tricks of jugglers; yet did these prophets foretell many things
concerning [the rewards of] virtue, and [punishments of] vice, which
when these zealots violated, they occasioned the fulfilling of those
very prophecies belonging to their own country; for there was a certain
ancient oracle of those men, that the city should then be taken and
the sanctuary burnt, by right of war, when a sedition should invade the
Jews, and their own hand should pollute the temple of God. Now while
these zealots did not [quite] disbelieve these predictions, they made
themselves the instruments of their accomplishment.</p>
        <p>CHAPTER 7.</p>
        <p>How John Tyrannized Over The Rest; And What Mischiefs The
     Zealots Did At Masada. How Also Vespasian Took Gadara; And
     What Actions Were Performed By Placidus.</p>
        <p>1. By this time John was beginning to tyrannize, and thought it beneath
him to accept of barely the same honors that others had; and joining to
himself by degrees a party of the wickedest of them all, he broke
off from the rest of the faction. This was brought about by his still
disagreeing with the opinions of others, and giving out injunctions
of his own, in a very imperious manner; so that it was evident he was
setting up a monarchical power. Now some submitted to him out of their
fear of him, and others out of their good-will to him; for he was a
shrewd man to entice men to him, both by deluding them and putting
cheats upon them. Nay, many there were that thought they should be safer
themselves, if the causes of their past insolent actions should now be
reduced to one head, and not to a great many. His activity was so great,
and that both in action and in counsel, that he had not a few guards
about him; yet was there a great party of his antagonists that left him;
among whom envy at him weighed a great deal, while they thought it a
very heavy thing to be in subjection to one that was formerly their
equal. But the main reason that moved men against him was the dread of
monarchy, for they could not hope easily to put an end to his power,
if he had once obtained it; and yet they knew that he would have this
pretense always against them, that they had opposed him when he was
first advanced; while every one chose rather to suffer any thing
whatsoever in war, than that, when they had been in a voluntary slavery
for some time, they should afterward perish. So the sedition was divided
into two parts, and John reigned in opposition to his adversaries over
one of them: but for their leaders, they watched one another, nor
did they at all, or at least very little, meddle with arms in their
quarrels; but they fought earnestly against the people, and contended
one with another which of them should bring home the greatest prey. But
because the city had to struggle with three of the greatest misfortunes,
war, and tyranny, and sedition, it appeared, upon the comparison,
that the war was the least troublesome to the populace of them all.
Accordingly, they ran away from their own houses to foreigners, and
obtained that preservation from the Romans which they despaired to
obtain among their own people.</p>
        <p>2. And now a fourth misfortune arose, in order to bring our nation to
destruction. There was a fortress of very great strength not far
from Jerusalem, which had been built by our ancient kings, both as
a repository for their effects in the hazards of war, and for the
preservation of their bodies at the same time. It was called Masada.
Those that were called Sicarii had taken possession of it formerly,
but at this time they overran the neighboring countries, aiming only
to procure to themselves necessaries; for the fear they were then in
prevented their further ravages. But when once they were informed
that the Roman army lay still, and that the Jews were divided between
sedition and tyranny, they boldly undertook greater matters; and at the
feast of unleavened bread, which the Jews celebrate in memory of their
deliverance from the Egyptian bondage, when they were sent back into
the country of their forefathers, they came down by night, without
being discovered by those that could have prevented them, and overran a
certain small city called Engaddi:--in which expedition they prevented
those citizens that could have stopped them, before they could arm
themselves, and fight them. They also dispersed them, and cast them
out of the city. As for such as could not run away, being women and
children, they slew of them above seven hundred. Afterward, when they
had carried every thing out of their houses, and had seized upon all
the fruits that were in a flourishing condition, they brought them into
Masada. And indeed these men laid all the villages that were about the
fortress waste, and made the whole country desolate; while there came to
them every day, from all parts, not a few men as corrupt as themselves.
At that time all the other regions of Judea that had hitherto been at
rest were in motion, by means of the robbers. Now as it is in a human
body, if the principal part be inflamed, all the members are subject to
the same distemper; so, by means of the sedition and disorder that
was in the metropolis,. had the wicked men that were in the country
opportunity to ravage the same. Accordingly, when every one of them had
plundered their own villages, they then retired into the desert; yet
were these men that now got together, and joined in the conspiracy by
parties, too small for an army, and too many for a gang of thieves: and
thus did they fall upon the holy places 11 and the cities; yet did it
now so happen that they were sometimes very ill treated by those upon
whom they fell with such violence, and were taken by them as men are
taken in war: but still they prevented any further punishment as do
robbers, who, as soon as their ravages [are discovered], run their
way. Nor was there now any part of Judea that was not in a miserable
condition, as well as its most eminent city also.</p>
        <p>3. These things were told Vespasian by deserters; for although the
seditious watched all the passages out of the city, and destroyed all,
whosoever they were, that came thither, yet were there some that had
concealed themselves, and when they had fled to the Romans, persuaded
their general to come to their city&#x27;s assistance, and save the remainder
of the people; informing him withal, that it was upon account of the
people&#x27;s good-will to the Romans that many of them were already slain,
and the survivors in danger of the same treatment. Vespasian did indeed
already pity the calamities these men were in, and arose, in appearance,
as though he was going to besiege Jerusalem, but in reality to deliver
them from a [worse] siege they were already under. However, he was
obliged first to overthrow what remained elsewhere, and to leave nothing
out of Jerusalem behind him that might interrupt him in that siege.
Accordingly, he marched against Gadara, the metropolis of Perea, which
was a place of strength, and entered that city on the fourth day of the
month Dystrus [Adar]; for the men of power had sent an embassage to
him, without the knowledge of the seditious, to treat about a surrender;
which they did out of the desire they had of peace, and for saving their
effects, because many of the citizens of Gadara were rich men. This
embassy the opposite party knew nothing of, but discovered it as
Vespasian was approaching near the city. However, they despaired of
keeping possession of the city, as being inferior in number to their
enemies who were within the city, and seeing the Romans very near to
the city; so they resolved to fly, but thought it dishonorable to do it
without shedding some blood, and revenging themselves on the authors
of this surrender; so they seized upon Dolesus, [a person not only the
first in rank and family in that city, but one that seemed the occasion
of sending such an embassy,] and slew him, and treated his dead body
after a barbarous manner, so very violent was their anger at him, and
then ran out of the city. And as now the Roman army was just upon them,
the people of Gadara admitted Vespasian with joyful acclamations, and
received from him the security of his right hand, as also a garrison
of horsemen and footmen, to guard them against the excursions of the
runagates; for as to their wall, they had pulled it down before
the Romans desired them so to do, that they might thereby give them
assurance that they were lovers of peace, and that, if they had a mind,
they could not now make war against them.</p>
        <p>4. And now Vespasian sent Placidus against those that had fled from
Gadara, with five hundred horsemen, and three thousand footmen, while he
returned himself to Cesarea, with the rest of the army. But as soon
as these fugitives saw the horsemen that pursued them just upon their
backs, and before they came to a close fight, they ran together to a
certain village, which was called Bethennabris, where finding a great
multitude of young men, and arming them, partly by their own consent,
partly by force, they rashly and suddenly assaulted Placidus and the
troops that were with him. These horsemen at the first onset gave way a
little, as contriving to entice them further off the wall; and when they
had drawn them into a place fit for their purpose, they made their horse
encompass them round, and threw their darts at them. So the horsemen cut
off the flight of the fugitives, while the foot terribly destroyed those
that fought against them; for those Jews did no more than show their
courage, and then were destroyed; for as they fell upon the Romans when
they were joined close together, and, as it were, walled about with
their entire armor, they were not able to find any place where the darts
could enter, nor were they any way able to break their ranks, while they
were themselves run through by the Roman darts, and, like the wildest
of wild beasts, rushed upon the point of others&#x27; swords; so some of them
were destroyed, as cut with their enemies&#x27; swords upon their faces, and
others were dispersed by the horsemen.</p>
        <p>5. Now Placidus&#x27;s concern was to exclude them in their flight from
getting into the village; and causing his horse to march continually on
that side of them, he then turned short upon them, and at the same time
his men made use of their darts, and easily took their aim at those that
were the nearest to them, as they made those that were further off turn
back by the terror they were in, till at last the most courageous of
them brake through those horsemen and fled to the wall of the village.
And now those that guarded the wall were in great doubt what to do;
for they could not bear the thoughts of excluding those that came from
Gadara, because of their own people that were among them; and yet, if
they should admit them, they expected to perish with them, which came
to pass accordingly; for as they were crowding together at the wall, the
Roman horsemen were just ready to fall in with them. However, the guards
prevented them, and shut the gates, when Placidus made an assault upon
them, and fighting courageously till it was dark, he got possession
of the wall, and of the people that were in the city, when the useless
multitude were destroyed; but those that were more potent ran away, and
the soldiers plundered the houses, and set the village on fire. As for
those that ran out of the village, they stirred up such as were in the
country, and exaggerating their own calamities, and telling them that
the whole army of the Romans were upon them, they put them into great
fear on every side; so they got in great numbers together, and fled to
Jericho, for they knew no other place that could afford them any hope of
escaping, it being a city that had a strong wall, and a great multitude
of inhabitants. But Placidus, relying much upon his horsemen, and his
former good success, followed them, and slew all that he overtook,
as far as Jordan; and when he had driven the whole multitude to the
river-side, where they were stopped by the current, [for it had been
augmented lately by rains, and was not fordable,] he put his soldiers
in array over against them; so the necessity the others were in provoked
them to hazard a battle, because there was no place whither they could
flee. They then extended themselves a very great way along the banks of
the river, and sustained the darts that were thrown at them, as well as
the attacks of the horsemen, who beat many of them, and pushed them into
the current. At which fight, hand to hand, fifteen thousand of them were
slain, while the number of those that were unwillingly forced to leap
into Jordan was prodigious. There were besides two thousand and two
hundred taken prisoners. A mighty prey was taken also, consisting of
asses, and sheep, and camels, and oxen.</p>
        <p>6. Now this destruction that fell upon the Jews, as it was not inferior
to any of the rest in itself, so did it still appear greater than it
really was; and this, because not only the whole country through which
they fled was filled with slaughter, and Jordan could not be passed
over, by reason of the dead bodies that were in it, but because the lake
Asphaltites was also full of dead bodies, that were carried down into
it by the river. And now Placidus, after this good success that he had,
fell violently upon the neighboring smaller cities and villages; when he
took Abila, and Julias, and Bezemoth, and all those that lay as far as
the lake Asphaltites, and put such of the deserters into each of them as
he thought proper. He then put his soldiers on board the ships, and
slew such as had fled to the lake, insomuch that all Perea had
either surrendered themselves, or were taken by the Romans, as far as
Machaerus.</p>

        <p>How Vespasian Upon Hearing Of Some Commotions In Gall, &lt;a
      href=&quot;#link4note-12&quot; name=&quot;link4noteref-12&quot; id=&quot;link4noteref-12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;
     Made Haste To Finish The Jewish War. A Description Of
     Jericho, And Of The Great Plain; With An Account Besides Of
     The Lake Asphaltites.</p>
        <p>1. In the mean time, an account came that there were commotions in Gall,
and that Vindex, together with the men of power in that country, had
revolted from Nero; which affair is more accurately described elsewhere.
This report, thus related to Vespasian, excited him to go on briskly
with the war; for he foresaw already the civil wars which were coming
upon them, nay, that the very government was in danger; and he thought,
if he could first reduce the eastern parts of the empire to peace, he
should make the fears for Italy the lighter; while therefore the winter
was his hinderance [from going into the field], he put garrisons into
the villages and smaller cities for their security; he put decurions
also into the villages, and centurions into the cities: he besides
this rebuilt many of the cities that had been laid waste; but at the
beginning of the spring he took the greatest part of his army, and led
it from Cesarea to Antipatris, where he spent two days in settling the
affairs of that city, and then, on the third day, he marched on, laying
waste and burning all the neighboring villages. And when he had laid
waste all the places about the toparchy of Thamnas, he passed on to
Lydda and Jamnia; and when both these cities had come over to him,
he placed a great many of those that had come over to him [from other
places] as inhabitants therein, and then came to Emmaus, where he seized
upon the passage which led thence to their metropolis, and fortified his
camp, and leaving the fifth legion therein, he came to the toparchy of
Bethletephon. He then destroyed that place, and the neighboring places,
by fire, and fortified, at proper places, the strong holds all about
Idumea; and when he had seized upon two villages, which were in the very
midst of Idumea, Betaris and Caphartobas, he slew above ten thousand of
the people, and carried into captivity above a thousand, and drove away
the rest of the multitude, and placed no small part of his own forces
in them, who overran and laid waste the whole mountainous country; while
he, with the rest of his forces, returned to Emmaus, whence he came down
through the country of Samaria, and hard by the city, by others called
Neapolis, [or Sichem,] but by the people of that country Mabortha, to
Corea, where he pitched his camp, on the second day of the month Desius
[Sivan]; and on the day following he came to Jericho; on which day
Trajan, one of his commanders, joined him with the forces he brought out
of Perea, all the places beyond Jordan being subdued already.</p>
        <p>2. Hereupon a great multitude prevented their approach, and came out
of Jericho, and fled to those mountainous parts that lay over against
Jerusalem, while that part which was left behind was in a great measure
destroyed; they also found the city desolate. It is situated in a plain;
but a naked and barren mountain, of a very great length, hangs over it,
which extends itself to the land about Scythopolis northward, but as far
as the country of Sodom, and the utmost limits of the lake Asphaltites,
southward. This mountain is all of it very uneven and uninhabited, by
reason of its barrenness: there is an opposite mountain that is situated
over against it, on the other side of Jordan; this last begins at
Julias, and the northern quarters, and extends itself southward as far
as Somorrhon, 13 which is the bounds of Petra, in Arabia. In this ridge
of mountains there is one called the Iron Mountain, that runs in length
as far as Moab. Now the region that lies in the middle between these
ridges of mountains is called the Great Plain; it reaches from the
village Ginnabris, as far as the lake Asphaltites; its length is two
hundred and thirty furlongs, and its breadth a hundred and twenty, and
it is divided in the midst by Jordan. It hath two lakes in it, that of
Asphaltites, and that of Tiberias, whose natures are opposite to each
other; for the former is salt and unfruitful, but that of Tiberias is
sweet and fruitful. This plain is much burnt up in summer time, and, by
reason of the extraordinary heat, contains a very unwholesome air; it is
all destitute of water excepting the river Jordan, which water of Jordan
is the occasion why those plantations of palm trees that are near its
banks are more flourishing, and much more fruitful, as are those that
are remote from it not so flourishing, or fruitful.</p>
        <p>3. Notwithstanding which, there is a fountain by Jericho, that runs
plentifully, and is very fit for watering the ground; it arises near
the old city, which Joshua, the son of Naue, the general of the Hebrews,
took the first of all the cities of the land of Canaan, by right of war.
The report is, that this fountain, at the beginning, caused not only the
blasting of the earth and the trees, but of the children born of women,
and that it was entirely of a sickly and corruptive nature to all
things whatsoever; but that it was made gentle, and very wholesome and
fruitful, by the prophet Elisha. This prophet was familiar with Elijah,
and was his successor, who, when he once was the guest of the people at
Jericho, and the men of the place had treated him very kindly, he both
made them amends as well as the country, by a lasting favor; for he went
out of the city to this fountain, and threw into the current an earthen
vessel full of salt; after which he stretched out his righteous hand
unto heaven, and, pouring out a mild drink-offering, he made this
supplication, That the current might be mollified, and that the veins of
fresh water might be opened; that God also would bring into the place
a more temperate and fertile air for the current, and would bestow upon
the people of that country plenty of the fruits of the earth, and a
succession of children; and that this prolific water might never fail
them, while they continued to be righteous. To these prayers Elisha
14 joined proper operations of his hands, after a skillful manner, and
changed the fountain; and that water, which had been the occasion of
barrenness and famine before, from that time did supply a numerous
posterity, and afforded great abundance to the country. Accordingly, the
power of it is so great in watering the ground, that if it do but once
touch a country, it affords a sweeter nourishment than other waters do,
when they lie so long upon them, till they are satiated with them. For
which reason, the advantage gained from other waters, when they flow in
great plenty, is but small, while that of this water is great when it
flows even in little quantities. Accordingly, it waters a larger space
of ground than any other waters do, and passes along a plain of seventy
furlongs long, and twenty broad; wherein it affords nourishment to those
most excellent gardens that are thick set with trees. There are in it
many sorts of palm trees that are watered by it, different from each
other in taste and name; the better sort of them, when they are pressed,
yield an excellent kind of honey, not much inferior in sweetness to
other honey. This country withal produces honey from bees; it also bears
that balsam which is the most precious of all the fruits in that place,
cypress trees also, and those that bear myrobalanum; so that he who
should pronounce this place to be divine would not be mistaken, wherein
is such plenty of trees produced as are very rare, and of the must
excellent sort. And indeed, if we speak of those other fruits, it will
not be easy to light on any climate in the habitable earth that can
well be compared to it, what is here sown comes up in such clusters;
the cause of which seems to me to be the warmth of the air, and the
fertility of the waters; the warmth calling forth the sprouts, and
making them spread, and the moisture making every one of them take root
firmly, and supplying that virtue which it stands in need of in summer
time. Now this country is then so sadly burnt up, that nobody cares to
come at it; and if the water be drawn up before sun-rising, and after
that exposed to the air, it becomes exceeding cold, and becomes of a
nature quite contrary to the ambient air; as in winter again it becomes
warm; and if you go into it, it appears very gentle. The ambient air is
here also of so good a temperature, that the people of the country are
clothed in linen-only, even when snow covers the rest of Judea. This
place is one hundred and fifty furlongs from Jerusalem, and sixty from
Jordan. The country, as far as Jerusalem, is desert and stony; but that
as far as Jordan and the lake Asphaltites lies lower indeed, though it
be equally desert and barren. But so much shall suffice to have said
about Jericho, and of the great happiness of its situation.</p>
        <p>4. The nature of the lake Asphaltites is also worth describing. It is,
as I have said already, bitter and unfruitful. It is so light [or thick]
that it bears up the heaviest things that are thrown into it; nor is it
easy for any one to make things sink therein to the bottom, if he had a
mind so to do. Accordingly, when Vespasian went to see it, he commanded
that some who could not swim should have their hands tied behind them,
and be thrown into the deep, when it so happened that they all swam as
if a wind had forced them upwards. Moreover, the change of the color of
this lake is wonderful, for it changes its appearance thrice every
day; and as the rays of the sun fall differently upon it, the light is
variously reflected. However, it casts up black clods of bitumen in many
parts of it; these swim at the top of the water, and resemble both in
shape and bigness headless bulls; and when the laborers that belong to
the lake come to it, and catch hold of it as it hangs together, they
draw it into their ships; but when the ship is full, it is not easy to
cut off the rest, for it is so tenacious as to make the ship hang upon
its clods till they set it loose with the menstrual blood of women, and
with urine, to which alone it yields. This bitumen is not only
useful for the caulking of ships, but for the cure of men&#x27;s bodies;
accordingly, it is mixed in a great many medicines. The length of this
lake is five hundred and eighty furlongs, where it is extended as far as
Zoar in Arabia; and its breadth is a hundred and fifty. The country of
Sodom borders upon it. It was of old a most happy land, both for the
fruits it bore and the riches of its cities, although it be now all
burnt up. It is related how, for the impiety of its inhabitants, it
was burnt by lightning; in consequence of which there are still the
remainders of that Divine fire, and the traces [or shadows] of the
five cities are still to be seen, as well as the ashes growing in their
fruits; which fruits have a color as if they were fit to be eaten, but
if you pluck them with your hands, they dissolve into smoke and ashes.
And thus what is related of this land of Sodom hath these marks of
credibility which our very sight affords us.</p>
        <p>CHAPTER 9.</p>
        <p>That Vespasian, After He Had Taken Gadara Made Preparation
     For The Siege Of Jerusalem; But That, Upon His Hearing Of
     The Death Of Nero, He Changed His Intentions. As Also
     Concerning Simon Of Geras.</p>
        <p>1. And now Vespasian had fortified all the places round about Jerusalem,
and erected citadels at Jericho and Adida, and placed garrisons in them
both, partly out of his own Romans, and partly out of the body of his
auxiliaries. He also sent Lucius Annius to Gerasa, and delivered to him
a body of horsemen, and a considerable number of footmen. So when he had
taken the city, which he did at the first onset, he slew a thousand of
those young men who had not prevented him by flying away; but he took
their families captive, and permitted his soldiers to plunder them of
their effects; after which he set fire to their houses, and went away to
the adjoining villages, while the men of power fled away, and the weaker
part were destroyed, and what was remaining was all burnt down. And now
the war having gone through all the mountainous country, and all the
plain country also, those that were at Jerusalem were deprived of
the liberty of going out of the city; for as to such as had a mind to
desert, they were watched by the zealots; and as to such as were not yet
on the side of the Romans, their army kept them in, by encompassing the
city round about on all sides.</p>
        <p>2. Now as Vespasian was returned to Cesarea, and was getting ready with
all his army to march directly to Jerusalem, he was informed that Nero
was dead, after he had reigned thirteen years and eight days. But as to
any narration after what manner he abused his power in the government,
and committed the management of affairs to those vile wretches,
Nymphidius and Tigellinus, his unworthy freed-men; and how he had a plot
laid against him by them, and was deserted by all his guards, and ran
away with four of his most trusty freed-men, and slew himself in the
suburbs of Rome; and how those that occasioned his death were in no long
time brought themselves to punishment; how also the war in Gall ended;
and how Galba was made emperor 16 and returned out of Spain to Rome; and
how he was accused by the soldiers as a pusillanimous person, and slain
by treachery in the middle of the market-place at Rome, and Otho was
made emperor; with his expedition against the commanders of Vitellius,
and his destruction thereupon; and besides what troubles there were
under Vitellius, and the fight that was about the capitol; as also how
Antonius Primus and Mucianus slew Vitellius, and his German legions, and
thereby put an end to that civil war; I have omitted to give an exact
account of them, because they are well known by all, and they are
described by a great number of Greek and Roman authors; yet for the sake
of the connexion of matters, and that my history may not be incoherent,
I have just touched upon every thing briefly. Wherefore Vespasian put
off at first his expedition against Jerusalem, and stood waiting whither
the empire would be transferred after the death of Nero. Moreover, when
he heard that Galba was made emperor, he attempted nothing till he also
should send him some directions about the war: however, he sent his son
Titus to him, to salute him, and to receive his commands about the Jews.
Upon the very same errand did king Agrippa sail along with Titus to
Galba; but as they were sailing in their long ships by the coasts of
Achaia, for it was winter time, they heard that Galba was slain, before
they could get to him, after he had reigned seven months and as many
days. After whom Otho took the government, and undertook the management
of public affairs. So Agrippa resolved to go on to Rome without any
terror; on account of the change in the government; but Titus, by a
Divine impulse, sailed back from Greece to Syria, and came in great
haste to Cesarea, to his father. And now they were both in suspense
about the public affairs, the Roman empire being then in a fluctuating
condition, and did not go on with their expedition against the Jews, but
thought that to make any attack upon foreigners was now unseasonable, on
account of the solicitude they were in for their own country.</p>
        <p>3. And now there arose another war at Jerusalem. There was a son of
Giora, one Simon, by birth of Gerasa, a young man, not so cunning
indeed as John [of Gisehala], who had already seized upon the city, but
superior in strength of body and courage; on which account, when he had
been driven away from that Acrabattene toparchy, which he once had, by
Ananus the high priest, he came to those robbers who had seized upon
Masada. At the first they suspected him, and only permitted him to come
with the women he brought with him into the lower part of the fortress,
while they dwelt in the upper part of it themselves. However, his manner
so well agreed with theirs, and he seemed so trusty a man, that he went
out with them, and ravaged and destroyed the country with them about
Masada; yet when he persuaded them to undertake greater things, he could
not prevail with them so to do; for as they were accustomed to dwell in
that citadel, they were afraid of going far from that which was
their hiding-place; but he affecting to tyrannize, and being fond of
greatness, when he had heard of the death of Ananus, he left them, and
went into the mountainous part of the country. So he proclaimed liberty
to those in slavery, and a reward to those already free, and got
together a set of wicked men from all quarters.</p>
        <p>4. And as he had now a strong body of men about him, he overran the
villages that lay in the mountainous country, and when there were still
more and more that came to him, he ventured to go down into the lower
parts of the country, and since he was now become formidable to the
cities, many of the men of power were corrupted by him; so that his army
was no longer composed of slaves and robbers, but a great many of the
populace were obedient to him as to their king. He then overran the
Acrabattene toparchy, and the places that reached as far as the Great
Idumea; for he built a wall at a certain village called Nain, and made
use of that as a fortress for his own party&#x27;s security; and at the
valley called Paran, he enlarged many of the caves, and many others he
found ready for his purpose; these he made use of as repositories for
his treasures, and receptacles for his prey, and therein he laid up the
fruits that he had got by rapine; and many of his partizans had their
dwelling in them; and he made no secret of it that he was exercising his
men beforehand, and making preparations for the assault of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>5. Whereupon the zealots, out of the dread they were in of his attacking
them, and being willing to prevent one that was growing up to oppose
them, went out against him with their weapons. Simon met them, and
joining battle with them, slew a considerable number of them, and drove
the rest before him into the city, but durst not trust so much upon his
forces as to make an assault upon the walls; but he resolved first to
subdue Idumea, and as he had now twenty thousand armed men, he marched
to the borders of their country. Hereupon the rulers of the Idumeans
got together on the sudden the most warlike part of their people, about
twenty-five thousand in number, and permitted the rest to be a guard
to their own country, by reason of the incursions that were made by the
Sicarii that were at Masada. Thus they received Simon at their borders,
where they fought him, and continued the battle all that day; and the
dispute lay whether they had conquered him, or been conquered by him. So
he went back to Nain, as did the Idumeans return home. Nor was it long
ere Simon came violently again upon their country; when he pitched his
camp at a certain village called Thecoe, and sent Eleazar, one of his
companions, to those that kept garrison at Herodium, and in order to
persuade them to surrender that fortress to him. The garrison received
this man readily, while they knew nothing of what he came about; but as
soon as he talked of the surrender of the place, they fell upon him with
their drawn swords, till he found that he had no place for flight, when
he threw himself down from the wall into the valley beneath; so he died
immediately: but the Idumeans, who were already much afraid of Simon&#x27;s
power, thought fit to take a view of the enemy&#x27;s army before they
hazarded a battle with them.</p>
        <p>6. Now there was one of their commanders named Jacob, who offered to
serve them readily upon that occasion, but had it in his mind to betray
them. He went therefore from the village Alurus, wherein the army of the
Idumeans were gotten together, and came to Simon, and at the very first
he agreed to betray his country to him, and took assurances upon oath
from him that he should always have him in esteem, and then promised him
that he would assist him in subduing all Idumea under him; upon which
account he was feasted after an obliging manner by Simon, and elevated
by his mighty promises; and when he was returned to his own men, he at
first belied the army of Simon, and said it was manifold more in number
than what it was; after which, he dexterously persuaded the commanders,
and by degrees the whole multitude, to receive Simon, and to surrender
the whole government up to him without fighting. And as he was doing
this, he invited Simon by his messengers, and promised him to disperse
the Idumeans, which he performed also; for as soon as their army was
nigh them, he first of all got upon his horse, and fled, together with
those whom he had corrupted; hereupon a terror fell upon the whole
multitude; and before it came to a close fight, they broke their ranks,
and every one retired to his own home.</p>
        <p>7. Thus did Simon unexpectedly march into Idumea, without bloodshed, and
made a sudden attack upon the city Hebron, and took it; wherein he got
possession of a great deal of prey, and plundered it of a vast quantity
of fruit. Now the people of the country say that it is an ancienter
city, not only than any in that country, but than Memphis in Egypt, and
accordingly its age is reckoned at two thousand and three hundred
years. They also relate that it had been the habitation of Abram, the
progenitor of the Jews, after he had removed out of Mesopotamia; and
they say that his posterity descended from thence into Egypt, whose
monuments are to this very time showed in that small city; the fabric of
which monuments are of the most excellent marble, and wrought after the
most elegant manner. There is also there showed, at the distance of six
furlongs from the city, a very large turpentine tree 17 and the report
goes, that this tree has continued ever since the creation of the world.
Thence did Simon make his progress over all Idumea, and did not only
ravage the cities and villages, but lay waste the whole country; for,
besides those that were completely armed, he had forty thousand men that
followed him, insomuch that he had not provisions enough to suffice such
a multitude. Now, besides this want of provisions that he was in, he
was of a barbarous disposition, and bore great anger at this nation, by
which means it came to pass that Idumea was greatly depopulated; and as
one may see all the woods behind despoiled of their leaves by locusts,
after they have been there, so was there nothing left behind Simon&#x27;s
army but a desert. Some places they burnt down, some they utterly
demolished, and whatsoever grew in the country, they either trod it
down or fed upon it, and by their marches they made the ground that was
cultivated harder and more untractable than that which was barren. In
short, there was no sign remaining of those places that had been laid
waste, that ever they had had a being.</p>
        <p>8. This success of Simon excited the zealots afresh; and though they
were afraid to fight him openly in a fair battle, yet did they lay
ambushes in the passes, and seized upon his wife, with a considerable
number of her attendants; whereupon they came back to the city
rejoicing, as if they had taken Simon himself captive, and were
in present expectation that he would lay down his arms, and make
supplication to them for his wife; but instead of indulging any merciful
affection, he grew very angry at them for seizing his beloved wife; so
he came to the wall of Jerusalem, and, like wild beasts when they are
wounded, and cannot overtake those that wounded them, he vented his
spleen upon all persons that he met with. Accordingly, he caught all
those that were come out of the city gates, either to gather herbs
or sticks, who were unarmed and in years; he then tormented them and
destroyed them, out of the immense rage he was in, and was almost ready
to taste the very flesh of their dead bodies. He also cut off the hands
of a great many, and sent them into the city to astonish his enemies,
and in order to make the people fall into a sedition, and desert those
that had been the authors of his wife&#x27;s seizure. He also enjoined them
to tell the people that Simon swore by the God of the universe, who sees
all things, that unless they will restore him his wife, he will break
down their wall, and inflict the like punishment upon all the citizens,
without sparing any age, and without making any distinction between the
guilty and the innocent. These threatenings so greatly affrighted, not
the people only, but the zealots themselves also, that they sent his
wife back to him; when he became a little milder, and left off his
perpetual blood-shedding.</p>
        <p>9. But now sedition and civil war prevailed, not only over Judea, but
in Italy also; for now Galba was slain in the midst of the Roman
market-place; then was Otho made emperor, and fought against Vitellius,
who set up for emperor also; for the legions in Germany had chosen him.
But when he gave battle to Valens and Cecinna, who were Vitellius&#x27;s
generals, at Betriacum, in Gaul, Otho gained the advantage on the first
day, but on the second day Vitellius&#x27;s soldiers had the victory; and
after much slaughter Otho slew himself, when he had heard of this defeat
at Brixia, and after he had managed the public affairs three months and
two days. 18 Otho&#x27;s army also came over to Vitellius&#x27;s generals, and he
came himself down to Rome with his army. But in the mean time Vespasian
removed from Cesarea, on the fifth day of the month Desius, [Sivan,] and
marched against those places of Judea which were not yet overthrown.
So he went up to the mountainous country, and took those two toparchies
that were called the Gophnitick and Acrabattene toparchies. After
which he took Bethel and Ephraim, two small cities; and when he had put
garrisons into them, he rode as far as Jerusalem, in which march he took
many prisoners, and many captives; but Cerealis, one of his commanders,
took a body of horsemen and footmen, and laid waste that part of
Idumea which was called the Upper Idumea, and attacked Caphethra, which
pretended to be a small city, and took it at the first onset, and burnt
it down. He also attacked Caphatabira, and laid siege to it, for it had
a very strong wall; and when he expected to spend a long time in that
siege, those that were within opened their gates on the sudden, and came
to beg pardon, and surrendered themselves up to him. When Cerealis had
conquered them, he went to Hebron, another very ancient city. I have
told you already that this city is situated in a mountainous country not
far off Jerusalem; and when he had broken into the city by force, what
multitude and young men were left therein he slew, and burnt down the
city; so that as now all the places were taken, excepting Herodlum, and
Masada, and Machaerus, which were in the possession of the robbers, so
Jerusalem was what the Romans at present aimed at.</p>
        <p>10. And now, as soon as Simon had set his wife free, and recovered her
from the zealots, he returned back to the remainders of Idumea, and
driving the nation all before him from all quarters, he compelled a
great number of them to retire to Jerusalem; he followed them himself
also to the city, and encompassed the wall all round again; and when he
lighted upon any laborers that were coming thither out of the country,
he slew them. Now this Simon, who was without the wall, was a greater
terror to the people than the Romans themselves, as were the zealots who
were within it more heavy upon them than both of the other; and during
this time did the mischievous contrivances and courage [of John] corrupt
the body of the Galileans; for these Galileans had advanced this John,
and made him very potent, who made them suitable requital from the
authority he had obtained by their means; for he permitted them to do
all things that any of them desired to do, while their inclination to
plunder was insatiable, as was their zeal in searching the houses of the
rich; and for the murdering of the men, and abusing of the women, it was
sport to them. They also devoured what spoils they had taken, together
with their blood, and indulged themselves in feminine wantonness,
without any disturbance, till they were satiated therewith; while they
decked their hair, and put on women&#x27;s garments, and were besmeared over
with ointments; and that they might appear very comely, they had paints
under their eyes, and imitated not only the ornaments, but also the
lusts of women, and were guilty of such intolerable uncleanness, that
they invented unlawful pleasures of that sort. And thus did they roll
themselves up and down the city, as in a brothel-house, and defiled it
entirely with their impure actions; nay, while their faces looked like
the faces of women, they killed with their right hands; and when their
gait was effeminate, they presently attacked men, and became warriors,
and drew their swords from under their finely dyed cloaks, and ran every
body through whom they alighted upon. However, Simon waited for such as
ran away from John, and was the more bloody of the two; and he who had
escaped the tyrant within the wall was destroyed by the other that lay
before the gates, so that all attempts of flying and deserting to the
Romans were cut off, as to those that had a mind so to do.</p>
        <p>11. Yet did the army that was under John raise a sedition against him,
and all the Idumeans separated themselves from the tyrant, and attempted
to destroy him, and this out of their envy at his power, and hatred of
his cruelty; so they got together, and slew many of the zealots, and
drove the rest before them into that royal palace that was built by
Grapte, who was a relation of Izates, the king of Adiabene; the Idumeans
fell in with them, and drove the zealots out thence into the temple, and
betook themselves to plunder John&#x27;s effects; for both he himself was in
that palace, and therein had he laid up the spoils he had acquired by
his tyranny. In the mean time, the multitude of those zealots that were
dispersed over the city ran together to the temple unto those that fled
thither, and John prepared to bring them down against the people and the
Idumeans, who were not so much afraid of being attacked by them [because
they were themselves better soldiers than they] as at their madness,
lest they should privately sally out of the temple and get among them,
and not only destroy them, but set the city on fire also. So they
assembled themselves together, and the high priests with them, and took
counsel after what manner they should avoid their assault. Now it was
God who turned their opinions to the worst advice, and thence they
devised such a remedy to get themselves free as was worse than the
disease itself. Accordingly, in order to overthrow John, they determined
to admit Simon, and earnestly to desire the introduction of a second
tyrant into the city; which resolution they brought to perfection, and
sent Matthias, the high priest, to beseech this Simon to come in to
them, of whom they had so often been afraid. Those also that had fled
from the zealots in Jerusalem joined in this request to him, out of
the desire they had of preserving their houses and their effects.
Accordingly he, in an arrogant manner, granted them his lordly
protection, and came into the city, in order to deliver it from the
zealots. The people also made joyful acclamations to him, as their
savior and their preserver; but when he was come in, with his army, he
took care to secure his own authority, and looked upon those that had
invited him in to be no less his enemies than those against whom the
invitation was intended.</p>
        <p>12. And thus did Simon get possession of Jerusalem, in the third year
of the war, in the month Xanthicus [Nisan]; whereupon John, with his
multitude of zealots, as being both prohibited from coming out of the
temple, and having lost their power in the city, [for Simon and
his party had plundered them of what they had,] were in despair of
deliverance. Simon also made an assault upon the temple, with the
assistance of the people, while the others stood upon the cloisters and
the battlements, and defended themselves from their assaults. However,
a considerable number of Simon&#x27;s party fell, and many were carried off
wounded; for the zealots threw their darts easily from a superior place,
and seldom failed of hitting their enemies; but having the advantage of
situation, and having withal erected four very large towers aforehand,
that their darts might come from higher places, one at the north-east
corner of the court, one above the Xystus, the third at another corner
over against the lower city, and the last was erected above the top of
the Pastophoria, where one of the priests stood of course, and gave a
signal beforehand, with a trumpet 19 at the beginning of every seventh
day, in the evening twilight, as also at the evening when that day was
finished, as giving notice to the people when they were to leave off
work, and when they were to go to work again. These men also set their
engines to cast darts and stones withal, upon those towers, with their
archers and slingers. And now Simon made his assault upon the temple
more faintly, by reason that the greatest part of his men grew weary of
that work; yet did he not leave off his opposition, because his army
was superior to the others, although the darts which were thrown by the
engines were carried a great way, and slew many of those that fought for
him.</p>
        <p>CHAPTER 10.</p>
        <p>How The Soldiers, Both In Judea And Egypt, Proclaimed
     Vespasian Emperor; And How Vespasian Released Josephus From
     His Bonds.</p>
        <p>1. Now about this very time it was that heavy calamities came about Rome
on all sides; for Vitellius was come from Germany with his soldiery, and
drew along with him a great multitude of other men besides. And when the
spaces allotted for soldiers could not contain them, he made all Rome
itself his camp, and filled all the houses with his armed men; which
men, when they saw the riches of Rome with those eyes which had never
seen such riches before, and found themselves shone round about on all
sides with silver and gold, they had much ado to contain their covetous
desires, and were ready to betake themselves to plunder, and to the
slaughter of such as should stand in their way. And this was the state
of affairs in Italy at that time.</p>
        <p>2. But when Vespasian had overthrown all the places that were near to
Jerusalem, he returned to Cesarea, and heard of the troubles that were
at Rome, and that Vitellius was emperor. This produced indignation in
him, although he well knew how to be governed as well as to govern,
and could not, with any satisfaction, own him for his lord who acted so
madly, and seized upon the government as if it were absolutely destitute
of a governor. And as this sorrow of his was violent, he was not able to
support the torments he was under, nor to apply himself further in other
wars, when his native country was laid waste; but then, as much as his
passion excited him to avenge his country, so much was he restrained
by the consideration of his distance therefrom; because fortune might
prevent him, and do a world of mischief before he could himself sail
over the sea to Italy, especially as it was still the winter season; so
he restrained his anger, how vehement soever it was at this time.</p>
        <p>3. But now his commanders and soldiers met in several companies, and
consulted openly about changing the public affairs; and, out of their
indignation, cried out, how &quot;at Rome there are soldiers that live
delicately, and when they have not ventured so much as to hear the fame
of war, they ordain whom they please for our governors, and in hopes
of gain make them emperors; while you, who have gone through so many
labors, and are grown into years under your helmets, give leave to
others to use such a power, when yet you have among yourselves one
more worthy to rule than any whom they have set up. Now what juster
opportunity shall they ever have of requiting their generals, if they
do not make use of this that is now before them? while there is so much
juster reasons for Vespasian&#x27;s being emperor than for Vitellius; as they
are themselves more deserving than those that made the other emperors;
for that they have undergone as great wars as have the troops that come
from Germany; nor are they inferior in war to those that have brought
that tyrant to Rome, nor have they undergone smaller labors than
they; for that neither will the Roman senate, nor people, bear such a
lascivious emperor as Vitellius, if he be compared with their chaste
Vespasian; nor will they endure a most barbarous tyrant, instead of
a good governor, nor choose one that hath no child 20 to preside over
them, instead of him that is a father; because the advancement of men&#x27;s
own children to dignities is certainly the greatest security kings can
have for themselves. Whether, therefore, we estimate the capacity
of governing from the skill of a person in years, we ought to have
Vespasian, or whether from the strength of a young man, we ought to have
Titus; for by this means we shall have the advantage of both their ages,
for that they will afford strength to those that shall be made emperors,
they having already three legions, besides other auxiliaries from the
neighboring kings, and will have further all the armies in the east to
support them, as also those in Europe, so they as they are out of the
distance and dread of Vitellius, besides such auxiliaries as they may
have in Italy itself; that is, Vespasian&#x27;s brother, 21 and his other son
[Domitian]; the one of whom will bring in a great many of those
young men that are of dignity, while the other is intrusted with the
government of the city, which office of his will be no small means of
Vespasian&#x27;s obtaining the government. Upon the whole, the case may be
such, that if we ourselves make further delays, the senate may choose an
emperor, whom the soldiers, who are the saviors of the empire, will have
in contempt.&quot;</p>
        <p>4. These were the discourses the soldiers had in their several
companies; after which they got together in a great body, and,
encouraging one another, they declared Vespasian emperor, 22 and
exhorted him to save the government, which was now in danger. Now
Vespasian&#x27;s concern had been for a considerable time about the public,
yet did he not intend to set up for governor himself, though his actions
showed him to deserve it, while he preferred that safety which is in a
private life before the dangers in a state of such dignity; but when he
refused the empire, the commanders insisted the more earnestly upon his
acceptance; and the soldiers came about him, with their drawn swords
in their hands, and threatened to kill him, unless he would now live
according to his dignity. And when he had shown his reluctance a great
while, and had endeavored to thrust away this dominion from him, he at
length, being not able to persuade them, yielded to their solicitations
that would salute him emperor.</p>
        <p>5. So upon the exhortations of Mucianus, and the other commanders, that
he would accept of the empire, and upon that of the rest of the army,
who cried out that they were willing to be led against all his opposers,
he was in the first place intent upon gaining the dominion over
Alexandria, as knowing that Egypt was of the greatest consequence, in
order to obtain the entire government, because of its supplying of corn
[to Rome]; which corn, if he could be master of, he hoped to dethrone
Vitellius, supposing he should aim to keep the empire by force [for he
would not be able to support himself, if the multitude at Rome should
once be in want of food]; and because he was desirous to join the two
legions that were at Alexandria to the other legions that were with him.
He also considered with himself, that he should then have that country
for a defense to himself against the uncertainty of fortune; for Egypt
23 is hard to be entered by land, and hath no good havens by sea. It
hath on the west the dry deserts of Libya; and on the south Siene, that
divides it from Ethiopia, as well as the cataracts of the Nile, that
cannot be sailed over; and on the east the Red Sea extended as far as
Coptus; and it is fortified on the north by the land that reaches to
Syria, together with that called the Egyptian Sea, having no havens in
it for ships. And thus is Egypt walled about on every side. Its length
between Pelusium and Siene is two thousand furlongs, and the passage by
sea from Plinthine to Pelusium is three thousand six hundred furlongs.
Its river Nile is navigable as far as the city called Elephantine, the
forenamed cataracts hindering ships from going any farther, The haven
also of Alexandria is not entered by the mariners without difficulty,
even in times of peace; for the passage inward is narrow, and full of
rocks that lie under the water, which oblige the mariners to turn from
a straight direction: its left side is blocked up by works made by men&#x27;s
hands on both sides; on its right side lies the island called Pharus,
which is situated just before the entrance, and supports a very great
tower, that affords the sight of a fire to such as sail within three
hundred furlongs of it, that ships may cast anchor a great way off in
the night time, by reason of the difficulty of sailing nearer. About
this island are built very great piers, the handiwork of men, against
which, when the sea dashes itself, and its waves are broken against
those boundaries, the navigation becomes very troublesome, and the
entrance through so narrow a passage is rendered dangerous; yet is the
haven itself, when you are got into it, a very safe one, and of thirty
furlongs in largeness; into which is brought what the country wants in
order to its happiness, as also what abundance the country affords more
than it wants itself is hence distributed into all the habitable earth.</p>
        <p>6. Justly, therefore, did Vespasian desire to obtain that government,
in order to corroborate his attempts upon the whole empire; so he
immediately sent to Tiberius Alexander, who was then governor of Egypt
and of Alexandria, and informed him what the army had put upon him,
and how he, being forced to accept of the burden of the government, was
desirous to have him for his confederate and supporter. Now as soon as
ever Alexander had read this letter, he readily obliged the legions
and the multitude to take the oath of fidelity to Vespasian, both which
willingly complied with him, as already acquainted with the courage
of the man, from that his conduct in their neighborhood. Accordingly
Vespasian, looking upon himself as already intrusted with the
government, got all things ready for his journey [to Rome]. Now fame
carried this news abroad more suddenly than one could have thought, that
he was emperor over the east, upon which every city kept festivals, and
celebrated sacrifices and oblations for such good news; the legions
also that were in Mysia and Pannonia, who had been in commotion a little
before, on account of this insolent attempt of Vitellius, were very
glad to take the oath of fidelity to Vespasian, upon his coming to
the empire. Vespasian then removed from Cesarea to Berytus, where
many embassages came to him from Syria, and many from other provinces,
bringing with them from every city crowns, and the congratulations of
the people. Mucianus came also, who was the president of the province,
and told him with what alacrity the people [received the news of his
advancement], and how the people of every city had taken the oath of
fidelity to him.</p>
        <p>7. So Vespasian&#x27;s good fortune succeeded to his wishes every where, and
the public affairs were, for the greatest part, already in his hands;
upon which he considered that he had not arrived at the government
without Divine Providence, but that a righteous kind of fate had brought
the empire under his power; for as he called to mind the other signals,
which had been a great many every where, that foretold he should obtain
the government, so did he remember what Josephus had said to him when he
ventured to foretell his coming to the empire while Nero was alive; so
he was much concerned that this man was still in bonds with him. He then
called for Mucianus, together with his other commanders and friends,
and, in the first place, he informed them what a valiant man Josephus
had been, and what great hardships he had made him undergo in the siege
of Jotapata. After that he related those predictions of his 24 which he
had then suspected as fictions, suggested out of the fear he was in,
but which had by time been demonstrated to be Divine. &quot;It is a shameful
thing [said he] that this man, who hath foretold my coming to the empire
beforehand, and been the minister of a Divine message to me, should
still be retained in the condition of a captive or prisoner.&quot; So he
called for Josephus, and commanded that he should be set at liberty;
whereupon the commanders promised themselves glorious things, from this
requital Vespasian made to a stranger. Titus was then present with
his father, and said, &quot;O father, it is but just that the scandal [of a
prisoner] should be taken off Josephus, together with his iron chain.
For if we do not barely loose his bonds, but cut them to pieces, he will
be like a man that had never been bound at all.&quot; For that is the usual
method as to such as have been bound without a cause. This advice was
agreed to by Vespasian also; so there came a man in, and cut the chain
to pieces; while Josephus received this testimony of his integrity for
a reward, and was moreover esteemed a person of credit as to futurities
also.</p>
        <p>CHAPTER 11.</p>
        <p>That Upon The Conquest And Slaughter Of Vitellius Vespasian
     Hastened His Journey To Rome; But Titus His Son Returned To
     Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>1. And now, when Vespasian had given answers to the embassages, and had
disposed of the places of power justly, 25 and according to every one&#x27;s
deserts, he came to Antioch, and consulting which way he had best take,
he preferred to go for Rome, rather than to march to Alexandria, because
he saw that Alexandria was sure to him already, but that the affairs at
Rome were put into disorder by Vitellius; so he sent Mucianus to Italy,
and committed a considerable army both of horsemen and footmen to him;
yet was Mucianus afraid of going by sea, because it was the middle of
winter, and so he led his army on foot through Cappadocia and Phrygia.</p>
        <p>2. In the mean time, Antonius Primus took the third of the legions that
were in Mysia, for he was president of that province, and made haste, in
order to fight Vitellius; whereupon Vitellius sent away Cecinna, with
a great army, having a mighty confidence in him, because of his having
beaten Otho. This Cecinna marched out of Rome in great haste, and found
Antonius about Cremona in Gall, which city is in the borders of Italy;
but when he saw there that the enemy were numerous and in good order, he
durst not fight them; and as he thought a retreat dangerous, so he began
to think of betraying his army to Antonius. Accordingly, he assembled
the centurions and tribunes that were under his command, and persuaded
them to go over to Antonius, and this by diminishing the reputation of
Vitellius, and by exaggerating the power of Vespasian. He also told them
that with the one there was no more than the bare name of dominion, but
with the other was the power of it; and that it was better for them to
prevent necessity, and gain favor, and, while they were likely to be
overcome in battle, to avoid the danger beforehand, and go over to
Antonius willingly; that Vespasian was able of himself to subdue what
had not yet submitted without their assistance, while Vitellius could
not preserve what he had already with it.</p>
        <p>3. Cecinna said this, and much more to the same purpose, and persuaded
them to comply with him; and both he and his army deserted; but still
the very same night the soldiers repented of what they had done, and a
fear seized on them, lest perhaps Vitellius who sent them should get the
better; and drawing their swords, they assaulted Cecinna, in order to
kill him; and the thing had been done by them, if the tribunes had not
fallen upon their knees, and besought them not to do it; so the soldiers
did not kill him, but put him in bonds, as a traitor, and were about to
send him to Vitellius. When [Antonius] Primus heard of this, he raised
up his men immediately, and made them put on their armor, and led them
against those that had revolted; hereupon they put themselves in order
of battle, and made a resistance for a while, but were soon beaten, and
fled to Cremona; then did Primus take his horsemen, and cut off their
entrance into the city, and encompassed and destroyed a great multitude
of them before the city, and fell into the city together with the rest,
and gave leave to his soldiers to plunder it. And here it was that many
strangers, who were merchants, as well as many of the people of that
country, perished, and among them Vitellius&#x27;s whole army, being thirty
thousand and two hundred, while Antonius lost no more of those that came
with him from Mysia than four thousand and five hundred: he then loosed
Cecinna, and sent him to Vespasian to tell him the good news. So he
came, and was received by him, and covered the scandal of his treachery
by the unexpected honors he received from Vespasian.</p>
        <p>4. And now, upon the news that Antonius was approaching, Sabinus took
courage at Rome, and assembled those cohorts of soldiers that kept watch
by night, and in the night time seized upon the capitol; and, as the
day came on, many men of character came over to him, with Domitian,
his brother&#x27;s son, whose encouragement was of very great weight for the
compassing the government. Now Vitellius was not much concerned at this
Primus, but was very angry with those that had revolted with Sabinus;
and thirsting, out of his own natural barbarity, after noble blood,
he sent out that part of the army which came along with him to fight
against the capitol; and many bold actions were done on this side, and
on the side of those that held the temple. But at last, the soldiers
that came from Germany, being too numerous for the others, got the hill
into their possession, where Domitian, with many other of the principal
Romans, providentially escaped, while the rest of the multitude were
entirely cut to pieces, and Sabinus himself was brought to Vitellius,
and then slain; the soldiers also plundered the temple of its ornaments,
and set it on fire. But now within a day&#x27;s time came Antonius, with his
army, and were met by Vitellius and his army; and having had a battle
in three several places, the last were all destroyed. Then did Vitellius
come out of the palace, in his cups, and satiated with an extravagant
and luxurious meal, as in the last extremity, and being drawn along
through the multitude, and abused with all sorts of torments, had his
head cut off in the midst of Rome, having retained the government eight
months and five days 26 and had he lived much longer, I cannot but think
the empire would not have been sufficient for his lust. Of the others
that were slain, were numbered above fifty thousand. This battle was
fought on the third day of the month Apelleus [Casleu]; on the next day
Mucianus came into the city with his army, and ordered Antonius and his
men to leave off killing; for they were still searching the houses,
and killed many of Vitellius&#x27;s soldiers, and many of the populace, as
supposing them to be of his party, preventing by their rage any accurate
distinction between them and others. He then produced Domitian, and
recommended him to the multitude, until his father should come himself;
so the people being now freed from their fears, made acclamations of
joy for Vespasian, as for their emperor, and kept festival days for his
confirmation, and for the destruction of Vitellius.</p>
        <p>5. And now, as Vespasian was come to Alexandria, this good news
came from Rome, and at the same time came embassies from all his own
habitable earth, to congratulate him upon his advancement; and though
this Alexandria was the greatest of all cities next to Rome, it proved
too narrow to contain the multitude that then came to it. So upon this
confirmation of Vespasian&#x27;s entire government, which was now settled,
and upon the unexpected deliverance of the public affairs of the Romans
from ruin, Vespasian turned his thoughts to what remained unsubdued in
Judea. However, he himself made haste to go to Rome, as the winter was
now almost over, and soon set the affairs of Alexandria in order,
but sent his son Titus, with a select part of his army, to destroy
Jerusalem. So Titus marched on foot as far as Nicopolis, which is
distant twenty furlongs from Alexandria; there he put his army on board
some long ships, and sailed upon the river along the Mendesian Nomus,
as far as the city Tumuis; there he got out of the ships, and walked
on foot, and lodged all night at a small city called Tanis. His second
station was Heracleopolis, and his third Pelusium; he then refreshed his
army at that place for two days, and on the third passed over the mouths
of the Nile at Pelusium; he then proceeded one station over the desert,
and pitched his camp at the temple of the Casian Jupiter, 27 and on the
next day at Ostracine. This station had no water, but the people of
the country make use of water brought from other places. After this he
rested at Rhinocolura, and from thence he went to Raphia, which was
his fourth station. This city is the beginning of Syria. For his fifth
station he pitched his camp at Gaza; after which he came to Ascalon, and
thence to Jamnia, and after that to Joppa, and from Joppa to Cesarea,
having taken a resolution to gather all his other forces together at
that place.</p>
        <p>WAR BOOK 4 FOOTNOTES</p>
        <p>1 (return) [ Here we have the exact situation of Jeroboam&#x27;s &quot;at the exit
of Little Jordan into Great Jordan, near the place called Daphne,&quot; but
of old Dan. See the note in Antiq. B. VIII. ch. 8. sect. 4. But Reland
suspects flint here we should read Dan instead of there being no where
else mention of a place called Daphne.]</p>
        <p>2 (return) [ These numbers in Josephus of thirty furlongs&#x27; ascent to the
top of Mount Tabor, whether we estimate it by winding and gradual, or
by the perpendicular altitude, and of twenty-six furlongs&#x27; circumference
upon the top, as also fifteen furlongs for this ascent in Polybius, with
Geminus&#x27;s perpendicular altitude of almost fourteen furlongs, here noted
by Dr. Hudson, do none of&#x27; them agree with the authentic testimony of
Mr. Maundrell, an eye-witness, p. 112, who says he was not an hour in
getting up to the top of this Mount Tabor, and that the area of the top
is an oval of about two furlongs in length, and one in breadth. So I
rather suppose Josephus wrote three furlongs for the ascent or altitude,
instead of thirty; and six furlongs for the circumference at the
top, instead of twenty-six,--since a mountain of only three furlongs
perpendicular altitude may easily require near an hour&#x27;s ascent, and the
circumference of an oval of the foregoing quantity is near six furlongs.
Nor certainly could such a vast circumference as twenty-six furlongs,
or three miles and a quarter, at that height be encompassed with a
wall, including a trench and other fortifications, [perhaps those still
remaining, ibid.] in the small interval of forty days, as Josephus here
says they were by himself.]</p>
        <p>3 (return) [ This name Dorcas in Greek, was Tabitha in Hebrew or Syriac,
as Acts 9:36. Accordingly, some of the manuscripts set it down here
Tabetha or Tabeta. Nor can the context in Josephus be made out by
supposing the reading to have been this: &quot;The son of Tabitha; which, in
the language of our country, denotes Dorcas&quot; [or a doe].]</p>
        <p>4 (return) [ Here we may discover the utter disgrace and ruin of the
high priesthood among the Jews, when undeserving, ignoble, and vile
persons were advanced to that holy office by the seditious; which sort
of high priests, as Josephus well remarks here, were thereupon obliged
to comply with and assist those that advanced them in their impious
practices. The names of these high priests, or rather ridiculous
and profane persons, were Jesus the son of Damneus, Jesus the son of
Gamaliel, Matthias the son of Theophilus, and that prodigious ignoramus
Phannias, the son of Samuel; all whom we shall meet with in Josephus&#x27;s
future history of this war; nor do we meet with any other so much as
pretended high priest after Phannias, till Jerusalem was taken and
destroyed.]</p>
        <p>5 (return) [ This tribe or course of the high priests, or priests, here
called Eniachim, seems to the learned Mr. Lowth, one well versed in
Josephus, to be that 1 Chronicles 24:12, &quot;the course of Jakim,&quot; where
some copies have &quot;the course of Eliakim;&quot; and I think this to be by no
means an improbable conjecture.]</p>
        <p>6 (return) [ This Symeon, the son of Gamaliel, is mentioned as the
president of the Jewish sanhedrim, and one that perished in the
destruction of Jerusalem, by the Jewish Rabbins, as Reland observes on
this place. He also tells us that those Rabbins mention one Jesus
the son of Gamala, as once a high priest, but this long before the
destruction of Jerusalem; so that if he were the same person with this
Jesus the son of Gamala, Josephus, he must have lived to be very old, or
they have been very bad chronologers.]</p>
        <p>7 (return) [ It is worth noting here, that this Ananus, the best of the
Jews at this time, and the high priest, who was so very uneasy at the
profanation of the Jewish courts of the temple by the zealots, did not
however scruple the profanation of the &quot;court of the Gentiles;&quot; as in
our Savior&#x27;s days it was very much profaned by the Jews; and made a
market-place, nay, a &quot;den of thieves,&quot; without scruple, Matthew 21:12,
13; Mark 11:15-17. Accordingly Josephus himself, when he speaks of the
two inner courts, calls them both hagia or holy places; but, so far as
I remember, never gives that character of the court of the Gentiles. See
B. V. ch. 9. sect. 2.]</p>
        <p>8 (return) [ This appellation of Jerusalem given it here by Simon, the
general of the Idumeans, &quot;the common city&quot; of the Idumeans, who were
proselytes of justice, as well as of the original native Jews, greatly
confirms that maxim of the Rabbins, here set down by Reland, that
&quot;Jerusalem was not assigned, or appropriated, to the tribe of Benjamin
or Judah, but every tribe had equal right to it [at their coming to
worship there at the several festivals].&quot; See a little before, ch. 3.
sect. 3, or &quot;worldly worship,&quot; as the author to the Hebrews calls the
sanctuary, &quot;a worldly sanctuary.&quot;]</p>
        <p>9 (return) [ Some commentators are ready to suppose that this
&quot;Zacharias, the son of Baruch,&quot; here most unjustly slain by the Jews
in the temple, was the very same person with &quot;Zacharias, the son of
Barachias,&quot; whom our Savior says the Jews &quot;slew between the temple and
the altar,&quot; Matthew 23:35. This is a somewhat strange exposition; since
Zechariah the prophet was really &quot;the son of Barachiah,&quot; and &quot;grandson
of Iddo, Zechariah 1:1; and how he died, we have no other account than
that before us in St. Matthew: while this &quot;Zacharias&quot; was &quot;the son of
Baruch.&quot; Since the slaughter was past when our Savior spake these
words, the Jews had then already slain him; whereas this slaughter of
&quot;Zacharias, the son of Baruch,&quot; in Josephus, was then about thirty-four
years future. And since the slaughter was &quot;between the temple and the
altar,&quot; in the court of the priests, one of the most sacred and remote
parts of the whole temple; while this was, in Josephus&#x27;s own words, in
the middle of the temple, and much the most probably in the court of
Israel only [for we have had no intimation that the zealots had at this
time profaned the court of the priests. See B. V. ch. 1. sect. 2].
Nor do I believe that our Josephus, who always insists on the peculiar
sacredness of the inmost court, and of the holy house that was in it,
would have omitted so material an aggravation of this barbarous murder,
as perpetrated in. a place so very holy, had that been the true place of
it. See Antiq. B. XI. ch. 7. sect. 1, and the note here on B. V. ch. 1.
sect. 2.]</p>
        <p>10 (return) [ This prediction, that the city [Jerusalem] should then &quot;be
taken, and the sanctuary burnt, by right of war, when a sedition should
invade Jews, and their own hands should pollute that temple;&quot; or, as
it is B. VI. ch. 2. sect. 1, &quot;when any one should begin to slay his
countrymen in the city;&quot; is wanting in our present copies of the Old
Testament. See Essay on the Old Test. p. 104--112. But this prediction,
as Josephus well remarks here, though, with the other predictions of
the prophets, it was now laughed at by the seditious, was by their very
means soon exactly fulfilled. However, I cannot but here take notice
of Grotius&#x27;s positive assertion upon Matthew 26:9, here quoted by Dr.
Hudson, that &quot;it ought to be taken for granted, as a certain truth, that
many predictions of the Jewish prophets were preserved, not in writing,
but by memory.&quot; Whereas, it seems to me so far from certain, that I
think it has no evidence nor probability at all.]</p>
        <p>11 (return) [ By these hiera, or &quot;holy places,&quot; as distinct from cities,
must be meant &quot;proseuchae,&quot; or &quot;houses of prayer,&quot; out of cities; of
which we find mention made in the New Testament and other authors. See
Luke 6:12; Acts 16:13, 16; Antiq. B. XIV. ch. 10. sect. 23; his Life,
sect. 51. &quot;In qua te quero proseucha?&quot; Juvenal Sat. III. yet. 296. They
were situated sometimes by the sides of rivers, Acts 16:13, or by
the sea-side, Antiq. B. XIV. ch. 10. sect. 23. So did the seventy-two
interpreters go to pray every morning by the sea-side before they went
to their work, B. XII. ch. 2. sect. 12.]</p>
        <p>12 (return) [ Gr. Galatia, and so everywhere.]</p>
        <p>13 (return) [ Whether this Somorrhon, or Somorrha, ought not to be here
written Gomorrha, as some MSS. in a manner have it, [for the place meant
by Josephus seems to be near Segor, or Zoar, at the very south of
the Dead Sea, hard by which stood Sodom and Gomorrha,] cannot now be
certainly determined, but seems by no means improbable.]</p>
        <p>14 (return) [ This excellent prayer of Elisha is wanting in our copies,
2 Kings 2:21, 22, though it be referred to also in the Apostolical
Constitutions, B. VII. ch. 37., and the success of it is mentioned in
them all.]</p>
        <p>16 (return) [ Of these Roman affairs and tumults under Galba, Otho, and
Vitellius, here only touched upon by Josephus, see Tacitus, Suelonius,
and Dio, more largely. However, we may observe with Ottius, that
Josephus writes the name of the second of them not Otto, with many
others, but Otho, with the coins. See also the note on ch. 11. sect. 4.]</p>
        <p>17 (return) [ Some of the ancients call this famous tree, or grove, an
oak others, a turpentine tree, or grove. It has been very famous in all
the past ages, and is so, I suppose, at this day; and that particularly
for an eminent mart or meeting of merchants there every year, as the
travelers inform us.]</p>
        <p>18 (return) [ Puetonius differs hardly three days from Josephus, and
says Otho perished on the ninety-fifth day of his reign. In Anthon. See
the note on ch. 11. sect. 4.]</p>
        <p>19 (return) [ This beginning and ending the observation of the Jewish
seventh day, or sabbath, with a priest&#x27;s blowing of a trumpet, is
remarkable, and no where else mentioned, that I know of. Nor is Reland&#x27;s
conjecture here improbable, that this was the very place that has
puzzled our commentators so long, called &quot;Musach Sabbati,&quot; the &quot;Covert
of the Sabbath,&quot; if that be the true reading, 2 Kings 16:18, because
here the proper priest stood dry, under a &quot;covering,&quot; to proclaim the
beginning and ending of every Jewish sabbath.]</p>
        <p>20 (return) [ The Roman authors that now remain say Vitellius had
children, whereas Josephus introduces here the Roman soldiers in Judea
saying he had none. Which of these assertions was the truth I know not.
Spanheim thinks he hath given a peculiar reason for calling Vitellius
&quot;childless,&quot; though he really had children, Diss. de Num. p. 649, 650;
to which it appears very difficult to give our assent.]</p>
        <p>21 (return) [ This brother of Vespasian was Flavius Sabinus, as
Suetonius informs us, in Vitell. sect. 15, and in Vespas. sect. 2. He is
also named by Josephus presently ch. 11. sect; 4.]</p>
        <p>22 (return) [ It is plain by the nature of the thing, as well as by
Josephus and Eutropius, that Vespasian was first of all saluted emperor
in Judea, and not till some time afterward in Egypt. Whence Tacitus&#x27;s
and Suetonius&#x27;s present copies must be correct text, when they both say
that he was first proclaimed in Egypt, and that on the calends of July,
while they still say it was the fifth of the Nones or Ides of the same
July before he was proclaimed in Judea. I suppose the month they there
intended was June, and not July, as the copies now have it; nor does
Tacitus&#x27;s coherence imply less. See Essay on the Revelation, p. 136.]</p>
        <p>23 (return) [ Here we have an authentic description of the bounds and
circumstances of Egypt, in the days of Vespasian and Titus.]</p>
        <p>24 (return) [ As Daniel was preferred by Darius and Cyrus, on account of
his having foretold the destruction of the Babylonian monarchy by their
means, and the consequent exaltation of the Medes and Persians, Daniel
5:6 or rather, as Jeremiah, when he was a prisoner, was set at liberty,
and honorably treated by Nebuzaradan, at the command of Nebuchadnezzar,
on account of his having foretold the destruction of Jerusalem by the
Babylonians, Jeremiah 40:1-7; so was our Josephus set at liberty, and
honorably treated, on account of his having foretold the advancement
of Vespasian and Titus to the Roman empire. All these are most eminent
instances of the interposition of Divine Providence, and of the
certainty of Divine predictions in the great revolutions of the four
monarchies. Several such-like examples there are, both in the sacred and
other histories, as in the case of Joseph in Egypt. and of Jaddua the
high priest, in the days of Alexander the Great, etc.]</p>
        <p>25 (return) [ This is well observed by Josephus, that Vespasian, in
order to secure his success, and establish his government at first,
distributed his offices and places upon the foot of justice, and
bestowed them on such as best deserved them, and were best fit for
them. Which wise conduct in a mere heathen ought to put those rulers
and ministers of state to shame, who, professing Christianity, act
otherwise, and thereby expose themselves and their kingdoms to vice and
destruction.]</p>
        <p>26 (return) [ The numbers in Josephus, ch. 9. sect. 2, 9, for Galba
seven months seven days, for Otho three months two days, and here
for Vitellius eight months five days, do not agree with any Roman
historians, who also disagree among themselves. And, indeed, Sealiger
justly complains, as Dr. Hudson observes on ch. 9. sect. 2, that this
period is very confused and uncertain in the ancient authors. They were
probably some of them contemporary together for some time; one of the
best evidences we have, I mean Ptolemy&#x27;s Canon, omits them all, as if
they did not all together reign one whole year, nor had a single Thoth,
or new-year&#x27;s day, [which then fell upon August 6,] in their entire
reigns. Dio also, who says that Vitellius reigned a year within ten
days, does yet estimate all their reigns together at no more than one
year, one month, and two days.]</p>
        <p>27 (return) [ There are coins of this Casian Jupiter still extant.]</p>
