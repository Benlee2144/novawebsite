        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">From The Siege Of Gamala To The Coming Of Titus To Besiege
     Jerusalem.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 1.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">The Siege And Taking Of Gamala.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now all those Galileans who, after the taking of Jotapata, had
revolted from the Romans, did, upon the conquest of Taricheae, deliver
themselves up to them again. And the Romans received all the fortresses
and the cities, excepting Gischala and those that had seized upon Mount
Tabor; Gamala also, which is a city over against Taricheae, but on the
other side of the lake, conspired with them. This city lay upon the
borders of Agrippa&#x27;s kingdom, as also did Sogana and Seleucia. And these
were both parts of Gaulanitis; for Sogana was a part of that called
the Upper Gaulanitis, as was Gamala of the Lower; while Seleucia was
situated at the lake Semechouitis, which lake is thirty furlongs in
breadth, and sixty in length; its marshes reach as far as the place
Daphne, which in other respects is a delicious place, and hath such
fountains as supply water to what is called Little Jordan, under the
temple of the golden calf, 1 where it is sent into Great Jordan. Now
Agrippa had united Sogana and Seleucia by leagues to himself, at the
very beginning of the revolt from the Romans; yet did not Gamala accede
to them, but relied upon the difficulty of the place, which was greater
than that of Jotapata, for it was situated upon a rough ridge of a high
mountain, with a kind of neck in the middle: where it begins to ascend,
it lengthens itself, and declines as much downward before as behind,
insomuch that it is like a camel in figure, from whence it is so named,
although the people of the country do not pronounce it accurately. Both
on the side and the face there are abrupt parts divided from the rest,
and ending in vast deep valleys; yet are the parts behind, where they
are joined to the mountain, somewhat easier of ascent than the other;
but then the people belonging to the place have cut an oblique ditch
there, and made that hard to be ascended also. On its acclivity, which
is straight, houses are built, and those very thick and close to one
another. The city also hangs so strangely, that it looks as if it would
fall down upon itself, so sharp is it at the top. It is exposed to the
south, and its southern mount, which reaches to an immense height, was
in the nature of a citadel to the city; and above that was a precipice,
not walled about, but extending itself to an immense depth. There was
also a spring of water within the wall, at the utmost limits of the
city.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. As this city was naturally hard to be taken, so had Josephus, by
building a wall about it, made it still stronger, as also by ditches and
mines under ground. The people that were in it were made more bold by
the nature of the place than the people of Jotapata had been, but it
had much fewer fighting men in it; and they had such a confidence in
the situation of the place, that they thought the enemy could not be too
many for them; for the city had been filled with those that had fled
to it for safety, on account of its strength; on which account they
had been able to resist those whom Agrippa sent to besiege it for seven
months together.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. But Vespasian removed from Emmaus, where he had last pitched his
camp before the city Tiberias, [now Emmaus, if it be interpreted, may
be rendered &quot;a warm bath,&quot; for therein is a spring of warm water, useful
for healing,] and came to Gamala; yet was its situation such that he was
not able to encompass it all round with soldiers to watch it; but where
the places were practicable, he set men to watch it, and seized upon the
mountain which was over it. And as the legions, according to their usual
custom, were fortifying their camp upon that mountain, he began to cast
up banks at the bottom, at the part towards the east, where the highest
tower of the whole city was, and where the fifteenth legion pitched
their camp; while the fifth legion did duty over against the midst of
the city, and whilst the tenth legion filled up the ditches and the
valleys. Now at this time it was that as king Agrippa was come nigh
the walls, and was endeavoring to speak to those that were on the walls
about a surrender, he was hit with a stone on his right elbow by one of
the slingers; he was then immediately surrounded with his own men. But
the Romans were excited to set about the siege, by their indignation
on the king&#x27;s account, and by their fear on their own account, as
concluding that those men would omit no kinds of barbarity against
foreigners and enemies, who where so enraged against one of their own
nation, and one that advised them to nothing but what was for their own
advantage.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. Now when the banks were finished, which was done on the sudden, both
by the multitude of hands, and by their being accustomed to such work,
they brought the machines; but Chares and Joseph, who were the most
potent men in the city, set their armed men in order, though already
in a fright, because they did not suppose that the city could hold out
long, since they had not a sufficient quantity either of water, or of
other necessaries. However, these their leaders encouraged them, and
brought them out upon the wall, and for a while indeed they drove away
those that were bringing the machines; but when those machines threw
darts and stones at them, they retired into the city; then did the
Romans bring battering rams to three several places, and made the wall
shake [and fall]. They then poured in over the parts of the wall that
were thrown down, with a mighty sound of trumpets and noise of armor,
and with a shout of the soldiers, and brake in by force upon those that
were in the city; but these men fell upon the Romans for some time, at
their first entrance, and prevented their going any further, and with
great courage beat them back; and the Romans were so overpowered by the
greater multitude of the people, who beat them on every side, that they
were obliged to run into the upper parts of the city. Whereupon the
people turned about, and fell upon their enemies, who had attacked them,
and thrust them down to the lower parts, and as they were distressed
by the narrowness and difficulty of the place, slew them; and as these
Romans could neither beat those back that were above them, nor escape
the force of their own men that were forcing their way forward, they
were compelled to fly into their enemies&#x27; houses, which were low; but
these houses being thus full, of soldiers, whose weight they could not
bear, fell down suddenly; and when one house fell, it shook down a great
many of those that were under it, as did those do to such as were under
them. By this means a vast number of the Romans perished; for they were
so terribly distressed, that although they saw the houses subsiding,
they were compelled to leap upon the tops of them; so that a great many
were ground to powder by these ruins, and a great many of those that
got from under them lost some of their limbs, but still a greater number
were suffocated by the dust that arose from those ruins. The people
of Gamala supposed this to be an assistance afforded them by God, and
without regarding what damage they suffered themselves, they pressed
forward, and thrust the enemy upon the tops of their houses; and when
they stumbled in the sharp and narrow streets, and were perpetually
falling down, they threw their stones or darts at them, and slew them.
Now the very ruins afforded them stones enow; and for iron weapons,
the dead men of the enemies&#x27; side afforded them what they wanted; for
drawing the swords of those that were dead, they made use of them to
despatch such as were only half dead; nay, there were a great number
who, upon their falling down from the tops of the houses, stabbed
themselves, and died after that manner; nor indeed was it easy for those
that were beaten back to fly away; for they were so unacquainted with
the ways, and the dust was so thick, that they wandered about without
knowing one another, and fell down dead among the crowd.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">5. Those therefore that were able to find the ways out of the city
retired. But now Vespasian always staid among those that were hard set;
for he was deeply affected with seeing the ruins of the city falling
upon his army, and forgot to take care of his own preservation. He went
up gradually towards the highest parts of the city before he was aware,
and was left in the midst of dangers, having only a very few with him;
for even his son Titus was not with him at that time, having been then
sent into Syria to Mucianus. However, he thought it not safe to fly,
nor did he esteem it a fit thing for him to do; but calling to mind the
actions he had done from his youth, and recollecting his courage, as if
he had been excited by a divine fury, he covered himself and those that
were with him with their shields, and formed a testudo over both their
bodies and their armor, and bore up against the enemy&#x27;s attacks, who
came running down from the top of the city; and without showing any
dread at the multitude of the men or of their darts, he endured all,
until the enemy took notice of that divine courage that was within him,
and remitted of their attacks; and when they pressed less zealously upon
him, he retired, though without showing his back to them till he was
gotten out of the walls of the city. Now a great number of the Romans
fell in this battle, among whom was Ebutius, the decurion, a man who
appeared not only in this engagement, wherein he fell, but every where,
and in former engagements, to be of the truest courage, and one that had
done very great mischief to the Jews. But there was a centurion whose
name was Gallus, who, during this disorder, being encompassed about,
he and ten other soldiers privately crept into the house of a certain
person, where he heard them talking at supper, what the people intended
to do against the Romans, or about themselves [for both the man himself
and those with him were Syrians]. So he got up in the night time, and
cut all their throats, and escaped, together with his soldiers, to the
Romans.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">6. And now Vespasian comforted his army, which was much dejected by
reflecting on their ill success, and because they had never before
fallen into such a calamity, and besides this, because they were greatly
ashamed that they had left their general alone in great dangers. As to
what concerned himself, he avoided to say any thing, that he might by
no means seem to complain of it; but he said that &quot;we ought to bear
manfully what usually falls out in war, and this, by considering what
the nature of war is, and how it can never be that we must conquer
without bloodshed on our own side; for there stands about us that
fortune which is of its own nature mutable; that while they had killed
so many ten thousands of the Jews, they had now paid their small share
of the reckoning to fate; and as it is the part of weak people to be too
much puffed up with good success, so is it the part of cowards to be too
much affrighted at that which is ill; for the change from the one to the
other is sudden on both sides; and he is the best warrior who is of a
sober mind under misfortunes, that he may continue in that temper, and
cheerfully recover what had been lost formerly; and as for what had now
happened, it was neither owing to their own effeminacy, nor to the valor
of the Jews, but the difficulty of the place was the occasion of their
advantage, and of our disappointment. Upon reflecting on which matter
one might blame your zeal as perfectly ungovernable; for when the enemy
had retired to their highest fastnesses, you ought to have restrained
yourselves, and not, by presenting yourselves at the top of the city, to
be exposed to dangers; but upon your having obtained the lower parts of
the city, you ought to have provoked those that had retired thither to
a safe and settled battle; whereas, in rushing so hastily upon victory,
you took no care of your safety. But this incautiousness in war, and
this madness of zeal, is not a Roman maxim. While we perform all that
we attempt by skill and good order, that procedure is the part of
barbarians, and is what the Jews chiefly support themselves by. We ought
therefore to return to our own virtue, and to be rather angry than any
longer dejected at this unlucky misfortune, and let every one seek for
his own consolation from his own hand; for by this means he will avenge
those that have been destroyed, and punish those that have killed them.
For myself, I will endeavor, as I have now done, to go first before
you against your enemies in every engagement, and to be the last that
retires from it.&quot;</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">7. So Vespasian encouraged his army by this speech; but for the people
of Gamala, it happened that they took courage for a little while, upon
such great and unaccountable success as they had had. But when they
considered with themselves that they had now no hopes of any terms of
accommodation, and reflecting upon it that they could not get away, and
that their provisions began already to be short, they were exceedingly
cast down, and their courage failed them; yet did they not neglect what
might be for their preservation, so far as they were able, but the most
courageous among them guarded those parts of the wall that were beaten
down, while the more infirm did the same to the rest of the wall that
still remained round the city. And as the Romans raised their banks, and
attempted to get into the city a second time, a great many of them fled
out of the city through impracticable valleys, where no guards were
placed, as also through subterraneous caverns; while those that were
afraid of being caught, and for that reason staid in the city, perished
for want of food; for what food they had was brought together from all
quarters, and reserved for the fighting men.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">8. And these were the hard circumstances that the people of Gamala
were in. But now Vespasian went about other work by the by, during this
siege, and that was to subdue those that had seized upon Mount Tabor, a
place that lies in the middle between the great plain and Scythopolis,
whose top is elevated as high as thirty furlongs 2 and is hardly to be
ascended on its north side; its top is a plain of twenty-six furlongs,
and all encompassed with a wall. Now Josephus erected this so long a
wall in forty days&#x27; time, and furnished it with other materials, and
with water from below, for the inhabitants only made use of rain water.
As therefore there was a great multitude of people gotten together
upon this mountain, Vespasian sent Placidus with six hundred horsemen
thither. Now, as it was impossible for him to ascend the mountain, he
invited many of them to peace, by the offer of his right hand for their
security, and of his intercession for them. Accordingly they came down,
but with a treacherous design, as well as he had the like treacherous
design upon them on the other side; for Placidus spoke mildly to them,
as aiming to take them, when he got them into the plain; they also came
down, as complying with his proposals, but it was in order to fall upon
him when he was not aware of it: however, Placidus&#x27;s stratagem was too
hard for theirs; for when the Jews began to fight, he pretended to run
away, and when they were in pursuit of the Romans, he enticed them
a great way along the plain, and then made his horsemen turn back;
whereupon he beat them, and slew a great number of them, and cut off the
retreat of the rest of the multitude, and hindered their return. So they
left Tabor, and fled to Jerusalem, while the people of the country came
to terms with him, for their water failed them, and so they delivered up
the mountain and themselves to Placidus.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">9. But of the people of Gamala, those that were of the bolder sort fled
away and hid themselves, while the more infirm perished by famine; but
the men of war sustained the siege till the two and twentieth day of
the month Hyperbereteus, [Tisri,] when three soldiers of the fifteenth
legion, about the morning watch, got under a high tower that was near
them, and undermined it, without making any noise; nor when they either
came to it, which was in the night time, nor when they were under it,
did those that guarded it perceive them. These soldiers then upon their
coming avoided making a noise, and when they had rolled away five of its
strongest stones, they went away hastily; whereupon the tower fell down
on a sudden, with a very great noise, and its guard fell headlong
with it; so that those that kept guard at other places were under such
disturbance, that they ran away; the Romans also slew many of those that
ventured to oppose them, among whom was Joseph, who was slain by a dart,
as he was running away over that part of the wall that was broken down:
but as those that were in the city were greatly affrighted at the noise,
they ran hither and thither, and a great consternation fell upon them,
as though all the enemy had fallen in at once upon them. Then it was
that Chares, who was ill, and under the physician&#x27;s hands, gave up the
ghost, the fear he was in greatly contributing to make his distemper
fatal to him. But the Romans so well remembered their former ill
success, that they did not enter the city till the three and twentieth
day of the forementioned month.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">10. At which time Titus, who was now returned, out of the indignation
he had at the destruction the Romans had undergone while he was absent,
took two hundred chosen horsemen and some footmen with him, and entered
without noise into the city. Now as the watch perceived that he was
coming, they made a noise, and betook themselves to their arms; and as
that his entrance was presently known to those that were in the city,
some of them caught hold of their children and their wives, and drew
them after them, and fled away to the citadel, with lamentations
and cries, while others of them went to meet Titus, and were killed
perpetually; but so many of them as were hindered from running up to
the citadel, not knowing what in the world to do, fell among the Roman
guards, while the groans of those that were killed were prodigiously
great every where, and blood ran down over all the lower parts of the
city, from the upper. But then Vespasian himself came to his assistance
against those that had fled to the citadel, and brought his whole army
with him; now this upper part of the city was every way rocky, and
difficult of ascent, and elevated to a vast altitude, and very full of
people on all sides, and encompassed with precipices, whereby the Jews
cut off those that came up to them, and did much mischief to others
by their darts, and the large stones which they rolled down upon them,
while they were themselves so high that the enemy&#x27;s darts could hardly
reach them. However, there arose such a Divine storm against them as
was instrumental to their destruction; this carried the Roman darts
upon them, and made those which they threw return back, and drove them
obliquely away from them; nor could the Jews indeed stand upon their
precipices, by reason of the violence of the wind, having nothing that
was stable to stand upon, nor could they see those that were ascending
up to them; so the Romans got up and surrounded them, and some they slew
before they could defend themselves, and others as they were delivering
up themselves; and the remembrance of those that were slain at their
former entrance into the city increased their rage against them now;
a great number also of those that were surrounded on every side,
and despaired of escaping, threw their children and their wives, and
themselves also, down the precipices, into the valley beneath, which,
near the citadel, had been dug hollow to a vast depth; but so it
happened, that the anger of the Romans appeared not to be so extravagant
as was the madness of those that were now taken, while the Romans
slew but four thousand, whereas the number of those that had thrown
themselves down was found to be five thousand: nor did any one escape
except two women, who were the daughters of Philip, and Philip himself
was the son of a certain eminent man called Jacimus, who had been
general of king Agrippa&#x27;s army; and these did therefore escape, because
they lay concealed from the rage of the Romans when the city was taken;
for otherwise they spared not so much as the infants, of which many were
flung down by them from the citadel. And thus was Gamala taken on the
three and twentieth day of the month Hyperbereteus, [Tisri,] whereas
the city had first revolted on the four and twentieth day of the month
Gorpieus [Elul].</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 2.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">The Surrender Of Gischala; While John Flies Away From It To
     Jerusalem.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now no place of Galilee remained to be taken but the small city of
Gischala, whose multitude yet were desirous of peace; for they were
generally husbandmen, and always applied themselves to cultivate the
fruits of the earth. However, there were a great number that belonged to
a band of robbers, that were already corrupted, and had crept in among
them, and some of the governing part of the citizens were sick of the
same distemper. It was John, the son of a certain man whose name was
Levi, that drew them into this rebellion, and encouraged them in it. He
was a cunning knave, and of a temper that could put on various shapes;
very rash in expecting great things, and very sagacious in bringing
about what he hoped for. It was known to every body that he was fond of
war, in order to thrust himself into authority; and the seditious part
of the people of Gischala were under his management, by whose means the
populace, who seemed ready to send ambassadors in order to surrender,
waited for the coming of the Romans in battle-array. Vespasian sent
against them Titus, with a thousand horsemen, but withdrew the tenth
legion to Scythopolis, while he returned to Cesarea with the two other
legions, that he might allow them to refresh themselves after their long
and hard campaign, thinking withal that the plenty which was in those
cities would improve their bodies and their spirits, against the
difficulties they were to go through afterwards; for he saw there would
be occasion for great pains about Jerusalem, which was not yet taken,
because it was the royal city, and the principal city of the whole
nation, and because those that had run away from the war in other places
got all together thither. It was also naturally strong, and the walls
that were built round it made him not a little concerned about it.
Moreover, he esteemed the men that were in it to be so courageous and
bold, that even without the consideration of the walls, it would be
hard to subdue them; for which reason he took care of and exercised his
soldiers beforehand for the work, as they do wrestlers before they begin
their undertaking.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. Now Titus, as he rode out to Gischala, found it would be easy for him
to take the city upon the first onset; but knew withal, that if he took
it by force, the multitude would be destroyed by the soldiers without
mercy. [Now he was already satiated with the shedding of blood, and
pitied the major part, who would then perish, without distinction,
together with the guilty.] So he was rather desirous the city might be
surrendered up to him on terms. Accordingly, when he saw the wall full
of those men that were of the corrupted party, he said to them, That he
could not but wonder what it was they depended on, when they alone
staid to fight the Romans, after every other city was taken by them,
especially when they have seen cities much better fortified than theirs
is overthrown by a single attack upon them; while as many as have
intrusted themselves to the security of the Romans&#x27; right hands, which
he now offers to them, without regarding their former insolence, do
enjoy their own possessions in safety; for that while they had hopes
of recovering their liberty, they might be pardoned; but that their
continuance still in their opposition, when they saw that to be
impossible, was inexcusable; for that if they will not comply with such
humane offers, and right hands for security, they should have experience
of such a war as would spare nobody, and should soon be made sensible
that their wall would be but a trifle, when battered by the Roman
machines; in depending on which they demonstrate themselves to be the
only Galileans that were no better than arrogant slaves and captives.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. Now none of the populace durst not only make a reply, but durst not
so much as get upon the wall, for it was all taken up by the robbers,
who were also the guard at the gates, in order to prevent any of the
rest from going out, in order to propose terms of submission, and from
receiving any of the horsemen into the city. But John returned
Titus this answer: That for himself he was content to hearken to his
proposals, and that he would either persuade or force those that refused
them. Yet he said that Titus ought to have such regard to the Jewish
law, as to grant them leave to celebrate that day, which was the seventh
day of the week, on which it was unlawful not only to remove their
arms, but even to treat of peace also; and that even the Romans were not
ignorant how the period of the seventh day was among them a cessation
from all labors; and that he who should compel them to transgress
the law about that day would be equally guilty with those that
were compelled to transgress it: and that this delay could be of no
disadvantage to him; for why should any body think of doing any thing in
the night, unless it was to fly away? which he might prevent by placing
his camp round about them; and that they should think it a great point
gained, if they might not be obliged to transgress the laws of their
country; and that it would be a right thing for him, who designed to
grant them peace, without their expectation of such a favor, to preserve
the laws of those they saved inviolable. Thus did this man put a trick
upon Titus, not so much out of regard to the seventh day as to his own
preservation, for he was afraid lest he should be quite deserted if the
city should be taken, and had his hopes of life in that night, and
in his flight therein. Now this was the work of God, who therefore
preserved this John, that he might bring on the destruction of
Jerusalem; as also it was his work that Titus was prevailed with by this
pretense for a delay, and that he pitched his camp further off the
city at Cydessa. This Cydessa was a strong Mediterranean village of the
Tyrians, which always hated and made war against the Jews; it had also
a great number of inhabitants, and was well fortified, which made it a
proper place for such as were enemies to the Jewish nation.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. Now, in the night time, when John saw that there was no Roman guard
about the city, he seized the opportunity directly, and, taking with him
not only the armed men that were about him, but a considerable number
of those that had little to do, together with their families, he fled to
Jerusalem. And indeed, though the man was making haste to get away, and
was tormented with fears of being a captive, or of losing his life, yet
did he prevail with himself to take out of the city along with him a
multitude of women and children, as far as twenty furlongs; but there he
left them as he proceeded further on his journey, where those that were
left behind made sad lamentations; for the farther every one of them was
come from his own people, the nearer they thought themselves to be to
their enemies. They also affrighted themselves with this thought, that
those who would carry them into captivity were just at hand, and still
turned themselves back at the mere noise they made themselves in this
their hasty flight, as if those from whom they fled were just upon them.
Many also of them missed their ways, and the earnestness of such as
aimed to outgo the rest threw down many of them. And indeed there was a
miserable destruction made of the women and children; while some of them
took courage to call their husbands and kinsmen back, and to beseech
them, with the bitterest lamentations, to stay for them; but John&#x27;s
exhortation, who cried out to them to save themselves, and fly away,
prevailed. He said also, that if the Romans should seize upon those
whom they left behind, they would be revenged on them for it. So this
multitude that run thus away was dispersed abroad, according as each of
them was able to run, one faster or slower than another.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">5. Now on the next day Titus came to the wall, to make the agreement;
whereupon the people opened their gates to him, and came out to him,
with their children and wives, and made acclamations of joy to him, as
to one that had been their benefactor, and had delivered the city out
of custody; they also informed him of John&#x27;s flight, and besought him
to spare them, and to come in, and bring the rest of those that were
for innovations to punishment. But Titus, not so much regarding the
supplications of the people, sent part of his horsemen to pursue after
John, but they could not overtake him, for he was gotten to Jerusalem
before; they also slew six thousand of the women and children who went
out with him, but returned back, and brought with them almost three
thousand. However, Titus was greatly displeased that he had not been
able to bring this John, who had deluded him, to punishment; yet he had
captives enough, as well as the corrupted part of the city, to satisfy
his anger, when it missed of John. So he entered the city in the midst
of acclamations of joy; and when he had given orders to the soldiers
to pull down a small part of the wall, as of a city taken in war, he
repressed those that had disturbed the city rather by threatenings than
by executions; for he thought that many would accuse innocent persons,
out of their own private animosities and quarrels, if he should attempt
to distinguish those that were worthy of punishment from the rest; and
that it was better to let a guilty person alone in his fears, that to
destroy with him any one that did not deserve it; for that probably such
a one might be taught prudence, by the fear of the punishment he had
deserved, and have a shame upon him for his former offenses, when he had
been forgiven; but that the punishment of such as have been once put
to death could never be retrieved. However, he placed a garrison in the
city for its security, by which means he should restrain those that were
for innovations, and should leave those that were peaceably disposed
in greater security. And thus was all Galilee taken, but this not till
after it had cost the Romans much pains before it could be taken by
them.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 3.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">Concerning John Of Gischala. Concerning The Zealots And The
     High Priest Ananus; As Also How The Jews Raise Seditions One
     Against Another [In Jerusalem].</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now upon John&#x27;s entry into Jerusalem, the whole body of the people
were in an uproar, and ten thousand of them crowded about every one of
the fugitives that were come to them, and inquired of them what miseries
had happened abroad, when their breath was so short, and hot, and quick,
that of itself it declared the great distress they were in; yet did they
talk big under their misfortunes, and pretended to say that they had not
fled away from the Romans, but came thither in order to fight them with
less hazard; for that it would be an unreasonable and a fruitless thing
for them to expose themselves to desperate hazards about Gischala, and
such weak cities, whereas they ought to lay up their weapons and their
zeal, and reserve it for their metropolis. But when they related to them
the taking of Gischala, and their decent departure, as they pretended,
from that place, many of the people understood it to be no better than a
flight; and especially when the people were told of those that were made
captives, they were in great confusion, and guessed those things to be
plain indications that they should be taken also. But for John, he was
very little concerned for those whom he had left behind him, but went
about among all the people, and persuaded them to go to war, by the
hopes he gave them. He affirmed that the affairs of the Romans were in
a weak condition, and extolled his own power. He also jested upon the
ignorance of the unskillful, as if those Romans, although they should
take to themselves wings, could never fly over the wall of Jerusalem,
who found such great difficulties in taking the villages of Galilee, and
had broken their engines of war against their walls.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. These harangues of John&#x27;s corrupted a great part of the young men,
and puffed them up for the war; but as to the more prudent part, and
those in years, there was not a man of them but foresaw what was coming,
and made lamentation on that account, as if the city was already undone;
and in this confusion were the people. But then it must be observed,
that the multitude that came out of the country were at discord before
the Jerusalem sedition began; for Titus went from Gischala to Cesates,
and Vespasian from Cesarea to Jamnia and Azotus, and took them both; and
when he had put garrisons into them, he came back with a great number
of the people, who were come over to him, upon his giving them his right
hand for their preservation. There were besides disorders and civil wars
in every city; and all those that were at quiet from the Romans turned
their hands one against another. There was also a bitter contest between
those that were fond of war, and those that were desirous for peace. At
the first this quarrelsome temper caught hold of private families, who
could not agree among themselves; after which those people that were the
dearest to one another brake through all restraints with regard to each
other, and every one associated with those of his own opinion, and began
already to stand in opposition one to another; so that seditions arose
every where, while those that were for innovations, and were desirous of
war, by their youth and boldness, were too hard for the aged and prudent
men. And, in the first place, all the people of every place betook
themselves to rapine; after which they got together in bodies, in
order to rob the people of the country, insomuch that for barbarity and
iniquity those of the same nation did no way differ from the Romans;
nay, it seemed to be a much lighter thing to be ruined by the Romans
than by themselves.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. Now the Roman garrisons, which guarded the cities, partly out of
their uneasiness to take such trouble upon them, and partly out of the
hatred they bare to the Jewish nation, did little or nothing towards
relieving the miserable, till the captains of these troops of robbers,
being satiated with rapines in the country, got all together from all
parts, and became a band of wickedness, and all together crept into
Jerusalem, which was now become a city without a governor, and, as the
ancient custom was, received without distinction all that belonged to
their nation; and these they then received, because all men supposed
that those who came so fast into the city came out of kindness, and for
their assistance, although these very men, besides the seditions they
raised, were otherwise the direct cause of the city&#x27;s destruction also;
for as they were an unprofitable and a useless multitude, they spent
those provisions beforehand which might otherwise have been sufficient
for the fighting men. Moreover, besides the bringing on of the war, they
were the occasions of sedition and famine therein.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. There were besides these other robbers that came out of the country,
and came into the city, and joining to them those that were worse than
themselves, omitted no kind of barbarity; for they did not measure their
courage by their rapines and plunderings only, but preceded as far as
murdering men; and this not in the night time or privately, or with
regard to ordinary men, but did it openly in the day time, and began
with the most eminent persons in the city; for the first man they
meddled with was Antipas, one of the royal lineage, and the most potent
man in the whole city, insomuch that the public treasures were committed
to his care; him they took and confined; as they did in the next place
to Levias, a person of great note, with Sophas, the son of Raguel, both
which were of royal lineage also. And besides these, they did the
same to the principal men of the country. This caused a terrible
consternation among the people, and everyone contented himself with
taking care of his own safety, as they would do if the city had been
taken in war.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">5. But these were not satisfied with the bonds into which they had put
the men forementioned; nor did they think it safe for them to keep
them thus in custody long, since they were men very powerful, and had
numerous families of their own that were able to avenge them. Nay,
they thought the very people would perhaps be so moved at these unjust
proceedings, as to rise in a body against them; it was therefore
resolved to have them slain accordingly, they sent one John, who was the
most bloody-minded of them all, to do that execution: this man was also
called &quot;the son of Dorcas,&quot; 3 in the language of our country. Ten more
men went along with him into the prison, with their swords drawn, and
so they cut the throats of those that were in custody there. The grand
lying pretence these men made for so flagrant an enormity was this,
that these men had had conferences with the Romans for a surrender of
Jerusalem to them; and so they said they had slain only such as were
traitors to their common liberty. Upon the whole, they grew the more
insolent upon this bold prank of theirs, as though they had been the
benefactors and saviors of the city.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">6. Now the people were come to that degree of meanness and fear, and
these robbers to that degree of madness, that these last took upon them
to appoint high priests. 4 So when they had disannulled the succession,
according to those families out of which the high priests used to be
made, they ordained certain unknown and ignoble persons for that office,
that they might have their assistance in their wicked undertakings; for
such as obtained this highest of all honors, without any desert, were
forced to comply with those that bestowed it on them. They also set
the principal men at variance one with another, by several sorts of
contrivances and tricks, and gained the opportunity of doing what they
pleased, by the mutual quarrels of those who might have obstructed
their measures; till at length, when they were satiated with the unjust
actions they had done towards men, they transferred their contumelious
behavior to God himself, and came into the sanctuary with polluted feet.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">7. And now the multitude were going to rise against them already; for
Ananus, the ancientest of the high priests, persuaded them to it. He was
a very prudent man, and had perhaps saved the city if he could but have
escaped the hands of those that plotted against him. These men made the
temple of God a strong hold for them, and a place whither they might
resort, in order to avoid the troubles they feared from the people;
the sanctuary was now become a refuge, and a shop of tyranny. They
also mixed jesting among the miseries they introduced, which was more
intolerable than what they did; for in order to try what surprise
the people would be under, and how far their own power extended, they
undertook to dispose of the high priesthood by casting lots for it,
whereas, as we have said already, it was to descend by succession in a
family. The pretense they made for this strange attempt was an ancient
practice, while they said that of old it was determined by lot; but in
truth, it was no better than a dissolution of an undeniable law, and
a cunning contrivance to seize upon the government, derived from those
that presumed to appoint governors as they themselves pleased.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">8. Hereupon they sent for one of the pontifical tribes, which is called
Eniachim, 5 and cast lots which of it should be the high priest. By
fortune the lot so fell as to demonstrate their iniquity after the
plainest manner, for it fell upon one whose name was Phannias, the son
of Samuel, of the village Aphtha. He was a man not only unworthy of the
high priesthood, but that did not well know what the high priesthood
was, such a mere rustic was he! yet did they hail this man, without his
own consent, out of the country, as if they were acting a play upon the
stage, and adorned him with a counterfeit tree; they also put upon him
the sacred garments, and upon every occasion instructed him what he was
to do. This horrid piece of wickedness was sport and pastime with them,
but occasioned the other priests, who at a distance saw their law made
a jest of, to shed tears, and sorely lament the dissolution of such a
sacred dignity.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">9. And now the people could no longer bear the insolence of this
procedure, but did all together run zealously, in order to overthrow
that tyranny; and indeed they were Gorion the son of Josephus, and
Symeon the son of Gamaliel, 6 who encouraged them, by going up and down
when they were assembled together in crowds, and as they saw them
alone, to bear no longer, but to inflict punishment upon these pests
and plagues of their freedom, and to purge the temple of these bloody
polluters of it. The best esteemed also of the high priests, Jesus the
son of Gamalas, and Ananus the son of Ananus when they were at their
assemblies, bitterly reproached the people for their sloth, and excited
them against the zealots; for that was the name they went by, as if they
were zealous in good undertakings, and were not rather zealous in the
worst actions, and extravagant in them beyond the example of others.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">10. And now, when the multitude were gotten together to an assembly, and
every one was in indignation at these men&#x27;s seizing upon the sanctuary,
at their rapine and murders, but had not yet begun their attacks upon
them, [the reason of which was this, that they imagined it to be a
difficult thing to suppress these zealots, as indeed the case was,]
Ananus stood in the midst of them, and casting his eyes frequently at
the temple, and having a flood of tears in his eyes, he said, &quot;Certainly
it had been good for me to die before I had seen the house of God full
of so many abominations, or these sacred places, that ought not to be
trodden upon at random, filled with the feet of these blood-shedding
villains; yet do I, who am clothed with the vestments of the high
priesthood, and am called by that most venerable name [of high priest],
still live, and am but too fond of living, and cannot endure to undergo
a death which would be the glory of my old age; and if I were the only
person concerned, and as it were in a desert, I would give up my life,
and that alone for God&#x27;s sake; for to what purpose is it to live among
a people insensible of their calamities, and where there is no notion
remaining of any remedy for the miseries that are upon them? for when
you are seized upon, you bear it! and when you are beaten, you are
silent! and when the people are murdered, nobody dare so much as send
out a groan openly! O bitter tyranny that we are under! But why do I
complain of the tyrants? Was it not you, and your sufferance of them,
that have nourished them? Was it not you that overlooked those that
first of all got together, for they were then but a few, and by your
silence made them grow to be many; and by conniving at them when they
took arms, in effect armed them against yourselves? You ought to have
then prevented their first attempts, when they fell a reproaching your
relations; but by neglecting that care in time, you have encouraged
these wretches to plunder men. When houses were pillaged, nobody said
a word, which was the occasion why they carried off the owners of those
houses; and when they were drawn through the midst of the city, nobody
came to their assistance. They then proceeded to put those whom you have
betrayed into their hands into bonds. I do not say how many and of what
characters those men were whom they thus served; but certainly they were
such as were accused by none, and condemned by none; and since nobody
succored them when they were put into bonds, the consequence was, that
you saw the same persons slain. We have seen this also; so that still
the best of the herd of brute animals, as it were, have been still led
to be sacrificed, when yet nobody said one word, or moved his right hand
for their preservation. Will you bear, therefore, will you bear to see
your sanctuary trampled on? and will you lay steps for these profane
wretches, upon which they may mount to higher degrees of insolence? Will
not you pluck them down from their exaltation? for even by this time
they had proceeded to higher enormities, if they had been able to
overthrow any thing greater than the sanctuary. They have seized upon
the strongest place of the whole city; you may call it the temple, if
you please, though it be like a citadel or fortress. Now, while you have
tyranny in so great a degree walled in, and see your enemies over your
heads, to what purpose is it to take counsel? and what have you to
support your minds withal? Perhaps you wait for the Romans, that they
may protect our holy places: are our matters then brought to that pass?
and are we come to that degree of misery, that our enemies themselves
are expected to pity us? O wretched creatures! will not you rise up and
turn upon those that strike you? which you may observe in wild beasts
themselves, that they will avenge themselves on those that strike
them. Will you not call to mind, every one of you, the calamities you
yourselves have suffered? nor lay before your eyes what afflictions you
yourselves have undergone? and will not such things sharpen your souls
to revenge? Is therefore that most honorable and most natural of our
passions utterly lost, I mean the desire of liberty? Truly we are in
love with slavery, and in love with those that lord it over us, as if
we had received that principle of subjection from our ancestors; yet did
they undergo many and great wars for the sake of liberty, nor were they
so far overcome by the power of the Egyptians, or the Medes, but that
still they did what they thought fit, notwithstanding their commands to
the contrary. And what occasion is there now for a war with the Romans?
[I meddle not with determining whether it be an advantageous and
profitable war or not.] What pretense is there for it? Is it not that
we may enjoy our liberty? Besides, shall we not bear the lords of the
habitable earth to be lords over us, and yet bear tyrants of our own
country? Although I must say that submission to foreigners may be borne,
because fortune hath already doomed us to it, while submission to wicked
people of our own nation is too unmanly, and brought upon us by our own
consent. However, since I have had occasion to mention the Romans, I
will not conceal a thing that, as I am speaking, comes into my mind, and
affects me considerably; it is this, that though we should be taken by
them, [God forbid the event should be so!] yet can we undergo nothing
that will be harder to be borne than what these men have already brought
upon us. How then can we avoid shedding of tears, when we see the Roman
donations in our temple, while we withal see those of our own nation
taking our spoils, and plundering our glorious metropolis, and
slaughtering our men, from which enormities those Romans themselves
would have abstained? to see those Romans never going beyond the bounds
allotted to profane persons, nor venturing to break in upon any of our
sacred customs; nay, having a horror on their minds when they view at a
distance those sacred walls; while some that have been born in this very
country, and brought up in our customs, and called Jews, do walk about
in the midst of the holy places, at the very time when their hands are
still warm with the slaughter of their own countrymen. Besides, can
any one be afraid of a war abroad, and that with such as will have
comparatively much greater moderation than our own people have? For
truly, if we may suit our words to the things they represent, it is
probable one may hereafter find the Romans to be the supporters of our
laws, and those within ourselves the subverters of them. And now I am
persuaded that every one of you here comes satisfied before I speak that
these overthrowers of our liberties deserve to be destroyed, and that
nobody can so much as devise a punishment that they have not deserved by
what they have done, and that you are all provoked against them by those
their wicked actions, whence you have suffered so greatly. But perhaps
many of you are affrighted at the multitude of those zealots, and at
their audaciousness, as well as at the advantage they have over us in
their being higher in place than we are; for these circumstances, as
they have been occasioned by your negligence, so will they become still
greater by being still longer neglected; for their multitude is every
day augmented, by every ill man&#x27;s running away to those that are like to
themselves, and their audaciousness is therefore inflamed, because they
meet with no obstruction to their designs. And for their higher place,
they will make use of it for engines also, if we give them time to do
so; but be assured of this, that if we go up to fight them, they will
be made tamer by their own consciences, and what advantages they have in
the height of their situation they will lose by the opposition of their
reason; perhaps also God himself, who hath been affronted by them, will
make what they throw at us return against themselves, and these
impious wretches will be killed by their own darts: let us but make our
appearance before them, and they will come to nothing. However, it is a
right thing, if there should be any danger in the attempt, to die before
these holy gates, and to spend our very lives, if not for the sake of
our children and wives, yet for God&#x27;s sake, and for the sake of his
sanctuary. I will assist you both with my counsel and with my hand; nor
shall any sagacity of ours be wanting for your support; nor shall you
see that I will be sparing of my body neither.&quot;</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">11. By these motives Ananus encouraged the multitude to go against the
zealots, although he knew how difficult it would be to disperse them,
because of their multitude, and their youth, and the courage of their
souls; but chiefly because of their consciousness of what they had done,
since they would not yield, as not so much as hoping for pardon at the
last for those their enormities. However, Ananus resolved to undergo
whatever sufferings might come upon him, rather than overlook things,
now they were in such great confusion. So the multitude cried out
to him, to lead them on against those whom he had described in his
exhortation to them, and every one of them was most readily disposed to
run any hazard whatsoever on that account.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">12. Now while Ananus was choosing out his men, and putting those that
were proper for his purpose in array for fighting, the zealots got
information of his undertaking, [for there were some who went to them,
and told them all that the people were doing,] and were irritated at
it, and leaping out of the temple in crowds, and by parties, spared none
whom they met with. Upon this Ananus got the populace together on the
sudden, who were more numerous indeed than the zealots, but inferior
to them in arms, because they had not been regularly put into array for
fighting; but the alacrity that every body showed supplied all their
defects on both sides, the citizens taking up so great a passion as was
stronger than arms, and deriving a degree of courage from the temple
more forcible than any multitude whatsoever; and indeed these citizens
thought it was not possible for them to dwell in the city, unless they
could cut off the robbers that were in it. The zealots also thought that
unless they prevailed, there would be no punishment so bad but it
would be inflicted on them. So their conflicts were conducted by their
passions; and at the first they only cast stones at each other in the
city, and before the temple, and threw their javelins at a distance; but
when either of them were too hard for the other, they made use of their
swords; and great slaughter was made on both sides, and a great number
were wounded. As for the dead bodies of the people, their relations
carried them out to their own houses; but when any of the zealots were
wounded, he went up into the temple, and defiled that sacred floor
with his blood, insomuch that one may say it was their blood alone
that polluted our sanctuary. Now in these conflicts the robbers always
sallied out of the temple, and were too hard for their enemies; but
the populace grew very angry, and became more and more numerous, and
reproached those that gave back, and those behind would not afford room
to those that were going off, but forced them on again, till at length
they made their whole body to turn against their adversaries, and the
robbers could no longer oppose them, but were forced gradually to retire
into the temple; when Ananus and his party fell into it at the same time
together with them. 7 This horribly affrighted the robbers, because
it deprived them of the first court; so they fled into the inner court
immediately, and shut the gates. Now Ananus did not think fit to make
any attack against the holy gates, although the other threw their stones
and darts at them from above. He also deemed it unlawful to introduce
the multitude into that court before they were purified; he therefore
chose out of them all by lot six thousand armed men, and placed them as
guards in the cloisters; so there was a succession of such guards
one after another, and every one was forced to attend in his course;
although many of the chief of the city were dismissed by those that then
took on them the government, upon their hiring some of the poorer sort,
and sending them to keep the guard in their stead.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">13. Now it was John who, as we told you, ran away from Gischala, and was
the occasion of all these being destroyed. He was a man of great craft,
and bore about him in his soul a strong passion after tyranny, and at
a distance was the adviser in these actions; and indeed at this time he
pretended to be of the people&#x27;s opinion, and went all about with Ananus
when he consulted the great men every day, and in the night time also
when he went round the watch; but he divulged their secrets to the
zealots, and every thing that the people deliberated about was by his
means known to their enemies, even before it had been well agreed upon
by themselves. And by way of contrivance how he might not be brought
into suspicion, he cultivated the greatest friendship possible with
Ananus, and with the chief of the people; yet did this overdoing of his
turn against him, for he flattered them so extravagantly, that he was
but the more suspected; and his constant attendance every where, even
when he was not invited to be present, made him strongly suspected of
betraying their secrets to the enemy; for they plainly perceived
that they understood all the resolutions taken against them at their
consultations. Nor was there any one whom they had so much reason to
suspect of that discovery as this John; yet was it not easy to get quit
of him, so potent was he grown by his wicked practices. He was also
supported by many of those eminent men, who were to be consulted upon
all considerable affairs; it was therefore thought reasonable to oblige
him to give them assurance of his good-will upon oath; accordingly John
took such an oath readily, that he would be on the people&#x27;s side, and
would not betray any of their counsels or practices to their enemies,
and would assist them in overthrowing those that attacked them, and that
both by his hand and his advice. So Ananus and his party believed his
oath, and did now receive him to their consultations without further
suspicion; nay, so far did they believe him, that they sent him as
their ambassador into the temple to the zealots, with proposals of
accommodation; for they were very desirous to avoid the pollution of the
temple as much as they possibly could, and that no one of their nation
should be slain therein.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">14. But now this John, as if his oath had been made to the zealots, and
for confirmation of his good-will to them, and not against them, went
into the temple, and stood in the midst of them, and spake as follows:
That he had run many hazards on their accounts, and in order to let them
know of every thing that was secretly contrived against them by Ananus
and his party; but that both he and they should be cast into the most
imminent danger, unless some providential assistance were afforded them;
for that Ananus made no longer delay, but had prevailed with the people
to send ambassadors to Vespasian, to invite him to come presently and
take the city; and that he had appointed a fast for the next day against
them, that they might obtain admission into the temple on a religious
account, or gain it by force, and fight with them there; that he did not
see how long they could either endure a siege, or how they could fight
against so many enemies. He added further, that it was by the
providence of God he was himself sent as an ambassador to them for an
accommodation; for that Artanus did therefore offer them such proposals,
that he might come upon them when they were unarmed; that they ought
to choose one of these two methods, either to intercede with those that
guarded them, to save their lives, or to provide some foreign assistance
for themselves; that if they fostered themselves with the hopes of
pardon, in case they were subdued, they had forgotten what desperate
things they had done, or could suppose, that as soon as the actors
repented, those that had suffered by them must be presently reconciled
to them; while those that have done injuries, though they pretend to
repent of them, are frequently hated by the others for that sort of
repentance; and that the sufferers, when they get the power into their
hands, are usually still more severe upon the actors; that the friends
and kindred of those that had been destroyed would always be laying
plots against them; and that a large body of people were very angry
on account of their gross breaches of their laws, and [illegal]
judicatures, insomuch that although some part might commiserate them,
those would be quite overborne by the majority.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 4.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">The Idumeans Being Sent For By The Zealots, Came Immediately
     To Jerusalem; And When They Were Excluded Out Of The City,
     They Lay All Night There. Jesus One Of The High Priests
     Makes A Speech To Them; And Simon The Idumean Makes A Reply
     To It.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now, by this crafty speech, John made the zealots afraid; yet durst
he not directly name what foreign assistance he meant, but in a covert
way only intimated at the Idumeans. But now, that he might particularly
irritate the leaders of the zealots, he calumniated Ananus, that he was
about a piece of barbarity, and did in a special manner threaten them.
These leaders were Eleazar, the son of Simon, who seemed the most
plausible man of them all, both in considering what was fit to be done,
and in the execution of what he had determined upon, and Zacharias, the
son of Phalek; both of whom derived their families from the priests.
Now when these two men had heard, not only the common threatenings which
belonged to them all, but those peculiarly leveled against themselves;
and besides, how Artanus and his party, in order to secure their own
dominion, had invited the Romans to come to them, for that also was
part of John&#x27;s lie; they hesitated a great while what they should do,
considering the shortness of the time by which they were straitened;
because the people were prepared to attack them very soon, and because
the suddenness of the plot laid against them had almost cut off all
their hopes of getting any foreign assistance; for they might be under
the height of their afflictions before any of their confederates could
be informed of it. However, it was resolved to call in the Idumeans; so
they wrote a short letter to this effect: That Ananus had imposed on
the people, and was betraying their metropolis to the Romans; that
they themselves had revolted from the rest, and were in custody in the
temple, on account of the preservation of their liberty; that there was
but a small time left wherein they might hope for their deliverance; and
that unless they would come immediately to their assistance, they should
themselves be soon in the power of Artanus, and the city would be in the
power of the Romans. They also charged the messengers to tell many more
circumstances to the rulers of the Idumeans. Now there were two active
men proposed for the carrying this message, and such as were able to
speak, and to persuade them that things were in this posture, and, what
was a qualification still more necessary than the former, they were very
swift of foot; for they knew well enough that these would immediately
comply with their desires, as being ever a tumultuous and disorderly
nation, always on the watch upon every motion, delighting in mutations;
and upon your flattering them ever so little, and petitioning them, they
soon take their arms, and put themselves into motion, and make haste to
a battle, as if it were to a feast. There was indeed occasion for quick
despatch in the carrying of this message, in which point the messengers
were no way defective. Both their names were Ananias; and they soon came
to the rulers of the Idumeans.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. Now these rulers were greatly surprised at the contents of the
letter, and at what those that came with it further told them; whereupon
they ran about the nation like madmen, and made proclamation that the
people should come to war; so a multitude was suddenly got together,
sooner indeed than the time appointed in the proclamation, and every
body caught up their arms, in order to maintain the liberty of their
metropolis; and twenty thousand of them were put into battle-array, and
came to Jerusalem, under four commanders, John, and Jacob the son of
Sosas; and besides these were Simon, the son of Cathlas, and Phineas,
the son of Clusothus.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. Now this exit of the messengers was not known either to Ananus or to
the guards, but the approach of the Idumeans was known to him; for as
he knew of it before they came, he ordered the gates to be shut against
them, and that the walls should be guarded. Yet did not he by any means
think of fighting against them, but, before they came to blows, to try
what persuasions would do. Accordingly, Jesus, the eldest of the high
priests next to Artanus, stood upon the tower that was over against
them, and said thus: &quot;Many troubles indeed, and those of various kinds,
have fallen upon this city, yet in none of them have I so much wondered
at her fortune as now, when you are come to assist wicked men, and
this after a manner very extraordinary; for I see that you are come to
support the vilest of men against us, and this with so great alacrity,
as you could hardly put on the like, in case our metropolis had called
you to her assistance against barbarians. And if I had perceived that
your army was composed of men like unto those who invited them, I had
not deemed your attempt so absurd; for nothing does so much cement the
minds of men together as the alliance there is between their manners.
But now for these men who have invited you, if you were to examine
them one by one, every one of them would be found to have deserved ten
thousand deaths; for the very rascality and offscouring of the whole
country, who have spent in debauchery their own substance, and, by way
of trial beforehand, have madly plundered the neighboring villages and
cities, in the upshot of all, have privately run together into this holy
city. They are robbers, who by their prodigious wickedness have profaned
this most sacred floor, and who are to be now seen drinking themselves
drunk in the sanctuary, and expending the spoils of those whom they have
slaughtered upon their unsatiable bellies. As for the multitude that
is with you, one may see them so decently adorned in their armor, as
it would become them to be had their metropolis called them to her
assistance against foreigners. What can a man call this procedure of
yours but the sport of fortune, when he sees a whole nation coming to
protect a sink of wicked wretches? I have for a good while been in doubt
what it could possibly be that should move you to do this so suddenly;
because certainly you would not take on your armor on the behalf of
robbers, and against a people of kin to you, without some very great
cause for your so doing. But we have an item that the Romans are
pretended, and that we are supposed to be going to betray this city
to them; for some of your men have lately made a clamor about those
matters, and have said they are come to set their metropolis free. Now
we cannot but admire at these wretches in their devising such a lie
as this against us; for they knew there was no other way to irritate
against us men that were naturally desirous of liberty, and on that
account the best disposed to fight against foreign enemies, but by
framing a tale as if we were going to betray that most desirable thing,
liberty. But you ought to consider what sort of people they are that
raise this calumny, and against what sort of people that calumny is
raised, and to gather the truth of things, not by fictitious speeches,
but out of the actions of both parties; for what occasion is there for
us to sell ourselves to the Romans, while it was in our power not to
have revolted from them at the first, or when we had once revolted, to
have returned under their dominion again, and this while the neighboring
countries were not yet laid waste? whereas it is not an easy thing to
be reconciled to the Romans, if we were desirous of it, now they have
subdued Galilee, and are thereby become proud and insolent; and to
endeavor to please them at the time when they are so near us, would
bring such a reproach upon us as were worse than death. As for myself,
indeed, I should have preferred peace with them before death; but now we
have once made war upon them, and fought with them, I prefer death, with
reputation, before living in captivity under them. But further, whether
do they pretend that we, who are the rulers of the people, have sent
thus privately to the Romans, or hath it been done by the common
suffrages of the people? If it be ourselves only that have done it, let
them name those friends of ours that have been sent, as our servants, to
manage this treachery. Hath any one been caught as he went out on this
errand, or seized upon as he came back? Are they in possession of our
letters? How could we be concealed from such a vast number of our fellow
citizens, among whom we are conversant every hour, while what is done
privately in the country is, it seems, known by the zealots, who are but
few in number, and under confinement also, and are not able to come out
of the temple into the city. Is this the first time that they are become
sensible how they ought to be punished for their insolent actions? For
while these men were free from the fear they are now under, there was
no suspicion raised that any of us were traitors. But if they lay
this charge against the people, this must have been done at a public
consultation, and not one of the people must have dissented from the
rest of the assembly; in which case the public fame of this matter would
have come to you sooner than any particular indication. But how could
that be? Must there not then have been ambassadors sent to confirm
the agreements? And let them tell us who this ambassador was that was
ordained for that purpose. But this is no other than a pretense of such
men as are loath to die, and are laboring to escape those punishments
that hang over them; for if fate had determined that this city was to be
betrayed into its enemies&#x27; hands, no other than these men that accuse
us falsely could have the impudence to do it, there being no wickedness
wanting to complete their impudent practices but this only, that they
become traitors. And now you Idumeans are come hither already with
your arms, it is your duty, in the first place, to be assisting to your
metropolis, and to join with us in cutting off those tyrants that have
infringed the rules of our regular tribunals, that have trampled upon
our laws, and made their swords the arbitrators of right and wrong; for
they have seized upon men of great eminence, and under no accusation,
as they stood in the midst of the market-place, and tortured them with
putting them into bonds, and, without bearing to hear what they had to
say, or what supplications they made, they destroyed them. You may, if
you please, come into the city, though not in the way of war, and take
a view of the marks still remaining of what I now say, and may see the
houses that have been depopulated by their rapacious hands, with those
wives and families that are in black, mourning for their slaughtered
relations; as also you may hear their groans and lamentations all the
city over; for there is nobody but hath tasted of the incursions of
these profane wretches, who have proceeded to that degree of madness,
as not only to have transferred their impudent robberies out of the
country, and the remote cities, into this city, the very face and head
of the whole nation, but out of the city into the temple also; for that
is now made their receptacle and refuge, and the fountain-head whence
their preparations are made against us. And this place, which is adored
by the habitable world, and honored by such as only know it by report,
as far as the ends of the earth, is trampled upon by these wild beasts
born among ourselves. They now triumph in the desperate condition they
are already in, when they hear that one people is going to fight against
another people, and one city against another city, and that your nation
hath gotten an army together against its own bowels. Instead of which
procedure, it were highly fit and reasonable, as I said before, for you
to join with us in cutting off these wretches, and in particular to
be revenged on them for putting this very cheat upon you; I mean, for
having the impudence to invite you to assist them, of whom they ought to
have stood in fear, as ready to punish them. But if you have some regard
to these men&#x27;s invitation of you, yet may you lay aside your arms, and
come into the city under the notion of our kindred, and take upon you
a middle name between that of auxiliaries and of enemies, and so become
judges in this case. However, consider what these men will gain by being
called into judgment before you, for such undeniable and such flagrant
crimes, who would not vouchsafe to hear such as had no accusations laid
against them to speak a word for themselves. However, let them gain this
advantage by your coming. But still, if you will neither take our part
in that indignation we have at these men, nor judge between us, the
third thing I have to propose is this, that you let us both alone,
and neither insult upon our calamities, nor abide with these plotters
against their metropolis; for though you should have ever so great a
suspicion that some of us have discoursed with the Romans, it is in your
power to watch the passages into the city; and in case any thing that we
have been accused of is brought to light, then to come and defend your
metropolis, and to inflict punishment on those that are found guilty;
for the enemy cannot prevent you who are so near to the city. But if,
after all, none of these proposals seem acceptable and moderate, do not
you wonder that the gates are shut against you, while you bear your arms
about you.&quot;</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. Thus spake Jesus; yet did not the multitude of the Idumeans give any
attention to what he said, but were in a rage, because they did not meet
with a ready entrance into the city. The generals also had indignation
at the offer of laying down their arms, and looked upon it as equal to
a captivity, to throw them away at any man&#x27;s injunction whomsoever.
But Simon, the son of Cathlas, one of their commanders, with much ado
quieted the tumult of his own men, and stood so that the high priests
might hear him, and said as follows: &quot;I can no longer wonder that the
patrons of liberty are under custody in the temple, since there are
those that shut the gates of our common city 8 to their own nation, and
at the same time are prepared to admit the Romans into it; nay, perhaps
are disposed to crown the gates with garlands at their coming, while
they speak to the Idumeans from their own towers, and enjoin them to
throw down their arms which they have taken up for the preservation of
its liberty. And while they will not intrust the guard of our metropolis
to their kindred, profess to make them judges of the differences that
are among them; nay, while they accuse some men of having slain others
without a legal trial, they do themselves condemn a whole nation after
an ignominious manner, and have now walled up that city from their
own nation, which used to be open to even all foreigners that came to
worship there. We have indeed come in great haste to you, and to a war
against our own countrymen; and the reason why we have made such haste
is this, that we may preserve that freedom which you are so unhappy
as to betray. You have probably been guilty of the like crimes against
those whom you keep in custody, and have, I suppose, collected together
the like plausible pretenses against them also that you make use of
against us; after which you have gotten the mastery of those within the
temple, and keep them in custody, while they are only taking care of
the public affairs. You have also shut the gates of the city in general
against nations that are the most nearly related to you; and while you
give such injurious commands to others, you complain that you have been
tyrannized over by them, and fix the name of unjust governors upon such
as are tyrannized over by yourselves. Who can bear this your abuse of
words, while they have a regard to the contrariety of your actions,
unless you mean this, that those Idumeans do now exclude you out of
your metropolis, whom you exclude from the sacred offices of your own
country? One may indeed justly complain of those that are besieged in
the temple, that when they had courage enough to punish those tyrants
whom you call eminent men, and free from any accusations, because of
their being your companions in wickedness, they did not begin with you,
and thereby cut off beforehand the most dangerous parts of this treason.
But if these men have been more merciful than the public necessity
required, we that are Idumeans will preserve this house of God, and will
fight for our common country, and will oppose by war as well those that
attack them from abroad, as those that betray them from within. Here
will we abide before the walls in our armor, until either the Romans
grow weary in waiting for you, or you become friends to liberty, and
repent of what you have done against it.&quot;</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">5. And now did the Idumeans make an acclamation to what Simon had said;
but Jesus went away sorrowful, as seeing that the Idumeans were against
all moderate counsels, and that the city was besieged on both sides. Nor
indeed were the minds of the Idumeans at rest; for they were in a rage
at the injury that had been offered them by their exclusion out of the
city; and when they thought the zealots had been strong, but saw nothing
of theirs to support them, they were in doubt about the matter, and many
of them repented that they had come thither. But the shame that would
attend them in case they returned without doing any thing at all, so far
overcame that their repentance, that they lay all night before the wall,
though in a very bad encampment; for there broke out a prodigious storm
in the night, with the utmost violence, and very strong winds, with
the largest showers of rain, with continued lightnings, terrible
thunderings, and amazing concussions and bellowings of the earth, that
was in an earthquake. These things were a manifest indication that some
destruction was coming upon men, when the system of the world was
put into this disorder; and any one would guess that these wonders
foreshowed some grand calamities that were coming.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">6. Now the opinion of the Idumeans and of the citizens was one and the
same. The Idumeans thought that God was angry at their taking arms, and
that they would not escape punishment for their making war upon their
metropolis. Ananus and his party thought that they had conquered without
fighting, and that God acted as a general for them; but truly they
proved both ill conjectures at what was to come, and made those events
to be ominous to their enemies, while they were themselves to undergo
the ill effects of them; for the Idumeans fenced one another by uniting
their bodies into one band, and thereby kept themselves warm, and
connecting their shields over their heads, were not so much hurt by the
rain. But the zealots were more deeply concerned for the danger these
men were in than they were for themselves, and got together, and looked
about them to see whether they could devise any means of assisting them.
The hotter sort of them thought it best to force their guards with their
arms, and after that to fall into the midst of the city, and publicly
open the gates to those that came to their assistance; as supposing the
guards would be in disorder, and give way at such an unexpected attempt
of theirs, especially as the greater part of them were unarmed and
unskilled in the affairs of war; and that besides the multitude of the
citizens would not be easily gathered together, but confined to
their houses by the storm: and that if there were any hazard in their
undertaking, it became them to suffer any thing whatsoever themselves,
rather than to overlook so great a multitude as were miserably perishing
on their account. But the more prudent part of them disapproved of this
forcible method, because they saw not only the guards about them very
numerous, but the walls of the city itself carefully watched, by reason
of the Idumeans. They also supposed that Ananus would be every where,
and visit the guards every hour; which indeed was done upon other
nights, but was omitted that night, not by reason of any slothfulness
of Ananus, but by the overbearing appointment of fate, that so both he
might himself perish, and the multitude of the guards might perish with
him; for truly, as the night was far gone, and the storm very terrible,
Ananus gave the guards in the cloisters leave to go to sleep; while it
came into the heads of the zealots to make use of the saws belonging to
the temple, and to cut the bars of the gates to pieces. The noise of the
wind, and that not inferior sound of the thunder, did here also conspire
with their designs, that the noise of the saws was not heard by the
others.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">7. So they secretly went out of the temple to the wall of the city, and
made use of their saws, and opened that gate which was over against the
Idumeans. Now at first there came a fear upon the Idumeans themselves,
which disturbed them, as imagining that Ananus and his party were coming
to attack them, so that every one of them had his right hand upon his
sword, in order to defend himself; but they soon came to know who they
were that came to them, and were entered the city. And had the Idumeans
then fallen upon the city, nothing could have hindered them from
destroying the people every man of them, such was the rage they were in
at that time; but as they first of all made haste to get the zealots out
of custody, which those that brought them in earnestly desired them to
do, and not to overlook those for whose sakes they were come, in the
midst of their distresses, nor to bring them into a still greater
danger; for that when they had once seized upon the guards, it would
be easy for them to fall upon the city; but that if the city were once
alarmed, they would not then be able to overcome those guards, because
as soon as they should perceive they were there, they would put
themselves in order to fight them, and would hinder their coming into
the temple.</p>
