        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">Concerning Bernice&#x27;s Petition To Florus, To Spare The Jews,
     But In Vain; As Also How, After The Seditious Flame Was
     Quenched, It Was Kindled Again By Florus.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. About this very time king Agrippa was going to Alexandria, to
congratulate Alexander upon his having obtained the government of Egypt
from Nero; but as his sister Bernice was come to Jerusalem, and saw the
wicked practices of the soldiers, she was sorely affected at it, and
frequently sent the masters of her horse and her guards to Florus, and
begged of him to leave off these slaughters; but he would not comply
with her request, nor have any regard either to the multitude of those
already slain, or to the nobility of her that interceded, but only to
the advantage he should make by this plundering; nay, this violence of
the soldiers brake out to such a degree of madness, that it spent itself
on the queen herself; for they did not only torment and destroy those
whom they had caught under her very eyes, but indeed had killed herself
also, unless she had prevented them by flying to the palace, and had
staid there all night with her guards, which she had about her for fear
of an insult from the soldiers. Now she dwelt then at Jerusalem, in
order to perform a vow 22 which she had made to God; for it is usual
with those that had been either afflicted with a distemper, or with any
other distresses, to make vows; and for thirty days before they are to
offer their sacrifices, to abstain from wine, and to shave the hair of
their head. Which things Bernice was now performing, and stood barefoot
before Florus&#x27;s tribunal, and besought him [to spare the Jews]. Yet
could she neither have any reverence paid to her, nor could she escape
without some danger of being slain herself.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. This happened upon the sixteenth day of the month Artemisius [Jyar].
Now, on the next day, the multitude, who were in a great agony, ran
together to the Upper Market-place, and made the loudest lamentations
for those that had perished; and the greatest part of the cries were
such as reflected on Florus; at which the men of power were affrighted,
together with the high priests, and rent their garments, and fell down
before each of them, and besought them to leave off, and not to provoke
Florus to some incurable procedure, besides what they had already
suffered. Accordingly, the multitude complied immediately, out of
reverence to those that had desired it of them, and out of the hope they
had that Florus would do them no more injuries.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. So Florus was troubled that the disturbances were over, and
endeavored to kindle that flame again, and sent for the high priests,
with the other eminent persons, and said the only demonstration that the
people would not make any other innovations should be this, that they
must go out and meet the soldiers that were ascending from Cesarea,
whence two cohorts were coming; and while these men were exhorting
the multitude so to do, he sent beforehand, and gave directions to the
centurions of the cohorts, that they should give notice to those that
were under them not to return the Jews&#x27; salutations; and that if they
made any reply to his disadvantage, they should make use of their
weapons. Now the high priests assembled the multitude in the temple, and
desired them to go and meet the Romans, and to salute the cohorts very
civilly, before their miserable case should become incurable. Now
the seditious part would not comply with these persuasions; but the
consideration of those that had been destroyed made them incline to
those that were the boldest for action.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">4. At this time it was that every priest, and every servant of God,
brought out the holy vessels, and the ornamental garments wherein they
used to minister in sacred things. The harpers also, and the singers of
hymns, came out with their instruments of music, and fell down before
the multitude, and begged of them that they would preserve those holy
ornaments to them, and not provoke the Romans to carry off those sacred
treasures. You might also see then the high priests themselves, with
dust sprinkled in great plenty upon their heads, with bosoms deprived of
any covering but what was rent; these besought every one of the eminent
men by name, and the multitude in common, that they would not for a
small offense betray their country to those that were desirous to have
it laid waste; saying, &quot;What benefit will it bring to the soldiers to
have a salutation from the Jews? or what amendment of your affairs will
it bring you, if you do not now go out to meet them? and that if they
saluted them civilly, all handle would be cut off from Florus to begin
a war; that they should thereby gain their country, and freedom from all
further sufferings; and that, besides, it would be a sign of great
want of command of themselves, if they should yield to a few seditious
persons, while it was fitter for them who were so great a people to
force the others to act soberly.&quot;</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">5. By these persuasions, which they used to the multitude and to the
seditious, they restrained some by threatenings, and others by the
reverence that was paid them. After this they led them out, and they met
the soldiers quietly, and after a composed manner, and when they were
come up with them, they saluted them; but when they made no answer,
the seditious exclaimed against Florus, which was the signal given for
falling upon them. The soldiers therefore encompassed them presently,
and struck them with their clubs; and as they fled away, the horsemen
trampled them down, so that a great many fell down dead by the strokes
of the Romans, and more by their own violence in crushing one another.
Now there was a terrible crowding about the gates, and while every
body was making haste to get before another, the flight of them all was
retarded, and a terrible destruction there was among those that fell
down, for they were suffocated, and broken to pieces by the multitude of
those that were uppermost; nor could any of them be distinguished by
his relations in order to the care of his funeral; the soldiers also who
beat them, fell upon those whom they overtook, without showing them any
mercy, and thrust the multitude through the place called Bezetha, 23 as
they forced their way, in order to get in and seize upon the temple, and
the tower Antonia. Florus also being desirous to get those places into
his possession, brought such as were with him out of the king&#x27;s palace,
and would have compelled them to get as far as the citadel [Antonia;]
but his attempt failed, for the people immediately turned back upon him,
and stopped the violence of his attempt; and as they stood upon the tops
of their houses, they threw their darts at the Romans, who, as they were
sorely galled thereby, because those weapons came from above, and they
were not able to make a passage through the multitude, which stopped up
the narrow passages, they retired to the camp which was at the palace.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">6. But for the seditious, they were afraid lest Florus should come
again, and get possession of the temple, through Antonia; so they got
immediately upon those cloisters of the temple that joined to Antonia,
and cut them down. This cooled the avarice of Florus; for whereas he
was eager to obtain the treasures of God [in the temple], and on that
account was desirous of getting into Antonia, as soon as the cloisters
were broken down, he left off his attempt; he then sent for the high
priests and the sanhedrim, and told them that he was indeed himself
going out of the city, but that he would leave them as large a garrison
as they should desire. Hereupon they promised that they would make no
innovations, in case he would leave them one band; but not that which
had fought with the Jews, because the multitude bore ill-will against
that band on account of what they had suffered from it; so he changed
the band as they desired, and, with the rest of his forces, returned to
Cesarea.</p>
