     Concerning Simon The Tyrant How He Was Taken, And Reserved
     For The Triumph.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. Now at the same time that Titus Caesar lay at the siege of Jerusalem,
did Vespasian go on board a merchantship and sailed from Alexandria to
Rhodes; whence he sailed away in ships with three rows of oars; and
as he touched at several cities that lay in his road, he was joyfully
received by them all, and so passed over from Ionia into Greece; whence
he set sail from Corcyra to the promontory of Iapyx, whence he took his
journey by land. But as for Titus, he marched from that Cesarea which
lay by the sea-side, and came to that which is named Cesarea Philippi,
and staid there a considerable time, and exhibited all sorts of shows
there. And here a great number of the captives were destroyed, some
being thrown to wild beasts, and others in multitudes forced to kill one
another, as if they were their enemies. And here it was that Titus was
informed of the seizure of Simon the son of Gioras, which was made after
the manner following: This Simon, during the siege of Jerusalem, was in
the upper city; but when the Roman army was gotten within the walls,
and were laying the city waste, he then took the most faithful of his
friends with him, and among them some that were stone-cutters, with
those iron tools which belonged to their occupation, and as great a
quantity of provisions as would suffice them for a long time, and let
himself and all them down into a certain subterraneous cavern that was
not visible above ground. Now, so far as had been digged of old, they
went onward along it without disturbance; but where they met with solid
earth, they dug a mine under ground, and this in hopes that they should
be able to proceed so far as to rise from under ground in a safe place,
and by that means escape. But when they came to make the experiment,
they were disappointed of their hope; for the miners could make but
small progress, and that with difficulty also; insomuch that their
provisions, though they distributed them by measure, began to fail
them. And now Simon, thinking he might be able to astonish and elude the
Romans, put on a white frock, and buttoned upon him a purple cloak, and
appeared out of the ground in the place where the temple had formerly
been. At the first, indeed, those that saw him were greatly astonished,
and stood still where they were; but afterward they came nearer to him,
and asked him who he was. Now Simon would not tell them, but bid them
call for their captain; and when they ran to call him, Terentius Rufus
2 who was left to command the army there, came to Simon, and learned of
him the whole truth, and kept him in bonds, and let Caesar know that he
was taken. Thus did God bring this man to be punished for what bitter
and savage tyranny he had exercised against his countrymen by those who
were his worst enemies; and this while he was not subdued by violence,
but voluntarily delivered himself up to them to be punished, and that
on the very same account that he had laid false accusations against many
Jews, as if they were falling away to the Romans, and had barbarously
slain them; for wicked actions do not escape the Divine anger, nor is
justice too weak to punish offenders, but in time overtakes those that
transgress its laws, and inflicts its punishments upon the wicked in a
manner, so much more severe, as they expected to escape it on account of
their not being punished immediately. 3 Simon was made sensible of this
by falling under the indignation of the Romans. This rise of his out of
the ground did also occasion the discovery of a great number of others
of the seditious at that time, who had hidden themselves under ground.
But for Simon, he was brought to Caesar in bonds, when he was come back
to that Cesarea which was on the seaside, who gave orders that he should
be kept against that triumph which he was to celebrate at Rome upon this
occasion.</p>
