        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">CHAPTER 5. How Solomon Built Himself A Royal Palace, Very Costly And
Splendid; And How He Solved The Riddles Which Were Sent Him By Hiram.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">1. After the building of the temple, which, as we have before said, was
finished in seven years, the king laid the foundation of his palace,
which he did not finish under thirteen years, for he was not equally
zealous in the building of this palace as he had been about the temple;
for as to that, though it was a great work, and required wonderful and
surprising application, yet God, for whom it was made, so far co-
operated therewith, that it was finished in the forementioned number of
years: but the palace, which was a building much inferior in dignity to
the temple, both on account that its materials had not been so long
beforehand gotten ready, nor had been so zealously prepared, and on
account that this was only a habitation for kings, and not for God, it
was longer in finishing. However, this building was raised so
magnificently, as suited the happy state of the Hebrews, and of the king
thereof. But it is necessary that I describe the entire structure and
disposition of the parts, that so those that light upon this book may
thereby make a conjecture, and, as it were, have a prospect of its
magnitude.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">2. This house was a large and curious building, and was supported by
many pillars, which Solomon built to contain a multitnde for hearing
causes, and taking cognizance of suits. It was sufficiently capacious to
contain a great body of men, who would come together to have their
causes determined. It was a hundred cubits long, and fifty broad, and
thirty high, supported by quadrangular pillars, which were all of cedar;
but its roof was according to the Corinthian order, 14 with folding
doors, and their adjoining pillars of equal magnitude, each fluted with
three cavities; which building as at once firm, and very ornamental.
There was also another house so ordered, that its entire breadth was
placed in the middle; it was quadrangular, and its breadth was thirty
cubits, having a temple over against it, raised upon massy pillars; in
which temple there was a large and very glorious room, wherein the king
sat in judgment. To this was joined another house that was built for his
queen. There were other smaller edifices for diet, and for sleep, after
public matters were over; and these were all floored with boards of
cedar. Some of these Solomon built with stones of ten cubits, and
wainscoted the walls with other stones that were sawed, and were of
great value, such as are dug out of the earth for the ornaments of
temples, and to make fine prospects in royal palaces, and which make the
mines whence they are dug famous. Now the contexture of the curious
workmanship of these stones was in three rows, but the fourth row would
make one admire its sculptures, whereby were represented trees, and all
sorts of plants; with the shades that arose from their branches, and
leaves that hung down from them. Those trees and plants covered the
stone that was beneath them, and their leaves were wrought so prodigious
thin and subtile, that you would think they were in motion; but the
other part up to the roof, was plastered over, and, as it were,
embroidered with colors and pictures. He, moreover, built other edifices
for pleasure; as also very long cloisters, and those situate in an
agreeable place of the palace; and among them a most glorious dining
room, for feastings and compotations, and full of gold, and such other
furniture as so fine a room ought to have for the conveniency of the
guests, and where all the vessels were made of gold. Now it is very hard
to reckon up the magnitude and the variety of the royal apartments; how
many rooms there were of the largest sort, how many of a bigness
inferior to those, and how many that were subterraneous and invisible;
the curiosity of those that enjoyed the fresh air; and the groves for
the most delightful prospect, for the avoiding the heat, and covering of
their bodies. And, to say all in brief, Solomon made the whole building
entirely of white stone, and cedar wood, and gold, and silver. He also
adorned the roofs and walls with stones set in gold, and beautified them
thereby in the same manner as he had beautified the temple of God with
the like stones. He also made himself a throne of prodigious bigness, of
ivory, constructed as a seat of justice, and having six steps to it; on
every one of which stood, on each end of the step two lions, two other
lions standing above also; but at the sitting place of the throne hands
came out and received the king; and when he sat backward, he rested on
half a bullock, that looked towards his back; but still all was fastened
together with gold.</p>
        <p style="font-family:var(--font-reading);line-height:1.8;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0.8rem 0;">3. When Solomon had completed all this in twenty years&#x27; time, because
Hiram king of Tyre had contributed a great deal of gold, and more silver
to these buildings, as also cedar wood and pine wood, he also rewarded
Hiram with rich presents; corn he sent him also year by year, and wine
and oil, which were the principal things that he stood in need of,
because he inhabited an island, as we have already said. And besides
these, he granted him certain cities of Galilee, twenty in number, that
lay not far from Tyre; which, when Hiram went to, and viewed, and did
not like the gift, he sent word to Solomon that he did not want such
cities as they were; and after that time these cities were called the
land of Cabul; which name, if it be interpreted according to the
language of the Phoenicians, denotes what does not please. Moreover, the
king of Tyre sent sophisms and enigmatical sayings to Solomon, and
desired he would solve them, and free them from the ambiguity that was
in them. Now so sagacious and understanding was Solomon, that none of
these problems were too hard for him; but he conquered them all by his
reasonings, and discovered their hidden meaning, and brought it to
light. Menander also, one who translated the Tyrian archives out of the
dialect of the Phoenicians into the Greek language, makes mention of
these two kings, where he says thus: &quot;When Abibalus was dead, his son
Hiram received the kingdom from him, who, when he had lived fifty-three
years, reigned thirty-four. He raised a bank in the large place, and
dedicated the golden pillar which is in Jupiter&#x27;s temple. He also went
and cut down materials of timber out of the mountain called Libanus, for
the roof of temples; and when he had pulled down the ancient temples, he
both built the temple of Hercules and that of Astarte; and he first set
up the temple of Hercules in the month Peritius; he also made an
expedition against the Euchii, or Titii, who did not pay their tribute,
and when he had subdued them to himself he returned. Under this king
there was Abdemon, a very youth in age, who always conquered the
difficult problems which Solomon, king of Jerusalem, commanded him to
explain. Dius also makes mention of him, where he says thus: &#x27;When
Abibalus was dead, his son Hiram reigned. He raised the eastern parts of
the city higher, and made the city itself larger. He also joined the
temple of Jupiter, which before stood by itself, to the city, by raising
a bank in the middle between them; and he adorned it with donations of
gold. Moreover, he went up to Mount Libanus, and cut down materials of
wood for the building of the temples.&#x27; He says also, that Solomon, who
was then king of Jerusalem, sent riddles to Hiram, and desired to
receive the like from him, but that he who could not solve them should
pay money to them that did solve them, and that Hiram accepted the
conditions; and when he was not able to solve the riddles proposed by
Solomon, he paid a great deal of money for his fine; but that he
afterward did solve the proposed riddles by means of Abdemon, a man of
Tyre; and that Hiram proposed other riddles, which, when Solomon could
not solve, he paid back a great deal of money to Hiram.&quot; This it is
which Dius wrote.</p>
