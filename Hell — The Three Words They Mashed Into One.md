# "Hell" — The Three Words They Mashed Into One
### Conversation between Ben and Fredrick — February 23, 2026

---

The English Bible uses "hell" as if it's one place. It's not. There are THREE completely different Greek/Hebrew words that all got translated as "hell." And when you separate them back out, the entire doctrine of eternal conscious torment starts to collapse.

---

## WORD #1: SHEOL (Hebrew — שְׁאוֹל)

This is the Old Testament word. It appears **65 times** in the Hebrew Bible. It simply means **"the grave"** or **"the realm of the dead."** It's where EVERYONE went — righteous and wicked alike.

- **Genesis 37:35** — Jacob says "I shall go down to Sheol to my son mourning." Jacob was a righteous man. He expected to go to Sheol. If Sheol is hell, Jacob expected to burn?
- **Psalm 16:10** — *"For You will not leave my soul in Sheol."* Messianic psalm about Jesus. If Sheol is hell, David is saying Jesus went to hell?
- **Psalm 139:8** — *"If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, You are there."* God is PRESENT in Sheol. If it's a place of separation from God, how is God there?
- **Ecclesiastes 9:10** — *"Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave (Sheol) where you are going."* Solomon says everyone is going there. Not as punishment. As the natural destination of the dead.

Sheol isn't punishment. It isn't fire. It isn't torture. It's the grave. The unseen realm. The place of the dead.

The KJV translated Sheol as "hell" **31 times**, as "grave" **31 times**, and as "pit" **3 times.** Same word. Three different English translations depending on what the translators felt like. That's not translation. That's editorial choice.

## WORD #2: HADES (Greek — ᾍδης)

The New Testament equivalent of Sheol. Appears **10 times**. Means the same thing — the realm of the dead, the unseen world.

- **Matthew 16:18** — *"The gates of Hades shall not prevail against my church."* Jesus wasn't saying hell won't defeat the church. He was saying DEATH won't defeat it.
- **Acts 2:27** — *"You will not leave my soul in Hades."* Peter quoting Psalm 16 about Jesus. Jesus went to Hades and came back. That's resurrection — conquering Hades, not escaping hell.
- **Revelation 20:13-14** — *"Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them... Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire."* Hades itself gets DESTROYED. Thrown into the lake of fire. If Hades IS hell, does hell go to hell? Unless Hades and the lake of fire are two completely different things. Which they are.

Hades is temporary. It's the holding place of the dead. It gets emptied and destroyed at the end.

## WORD #3: GEHENNA (Greek — γέεννα)

This is the one Jesus actually used when warning people. Appears **12 times** — 11 from Jesus, 1 from James. It was a REAL, PHYSICAL PLACE.

**Gehenna** comes from the Hebrew **ge-hinnom** — the Valley of Hinnom. A literal valley on the south side of Jerusalem. You can visit it TODAY.

- **2 Kings 23:10** — King Josiah defiled Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom because people had been burning their CHILDREN as sacrifices to Molech.
- **Jeremiah 7:31-32** — God specifically says burning people was NEVER His idea. *"...which I did not command, nor did it come into My heart."* The concept of people burning was so repulsive to God He said it never even entered His mind.
- **Jeremiah 19:6** — God says this valley will be called "the Valley of Slaughter."

By Jesus's time, Gehenna had become **Jerusalem's garbage dump.** Trash, dead animals, fires burning continuously, worms feeding on decay.

When Jesus said "it's better to cut off your hand than to be thrown into Gehenna" — His audience didn't picture an underground fire dimension. They pictured THE DUMP. The place where worthless things are thrown away and destroyed.

He was using the most vivid image available to communicate DESTRUCTION and WASTE — not eternal conscious torment.

---

## WORD #4 (bonus): TARTARUS (Greek — ταρταρόω)

Appears exactly ONE time — **2 Peter 2:4** — *"God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to hell (tartarus)."*

Borrowed from Greek mythology — the deepest prison where the Titans were imprisoned. Peter uses it specifically for the fallen angels (Watchers from Genesis 6 / Book of Enoch). Not humans. Angels.

This isn't where people go. It's an angelic prison.

## What The Translators Did

They took Sheol (the grave), Hades (realm of the dead), Gehenna (Jerusalem's garbage dump), and Tartarus (angelic prison) — four completely different concepts — and translated them all as one word: **HELL.**

From that one English word, an entire theology was built:
- Underground fire dimension ← not in the text
- Eternal conscious torment ← built on mistranslation of "aionios"
- Satan rules hell ← nowhere in Scripture (prepared as punishment FOR him — Matthew 25:41)
- You go there if you don't say the right prayer ← the sinner's prayer doesn't exist in the Bible

---

## "Eternal" — The Word That Sealed The Lie

**Aionios** (αἰώνιος) — translated "eternal" or "everlasting." Comes from **aion** (αἰών) — an AGE. A period of time with a beginning and end.

**Matthew 25:46** — "everlasting (aionios) punishment." If translated consistently: "age-lasting punishment."

**Romans 16:25** — "the mystery kept secret since the world began (aionios)." Here aionios clearly means "for a long time" not "literally infinite."

The early church father **Origen** (3rd century) taught universal reconciliation based on this exact Greek reading.

Of the six major theological schools in the early church:
- **Four** taught universal reconciliation (majority view)
- **One** taught annihilation (wicked cease to exist)
- **One** taught eternal torment

Eternal conscious torment was the MINORITY position for the first 500 years. It became dominant after Augustine (who didn't read Greek) systematized it.

## What About The Rich Man and Lazarus? (Luke 16:19-31)

1. It follows a series of PARABLES — Jesus is teaching through illustration
2. The rich man is in HADES — not Gehenna. Hades gets emptied and destroyed (Revelation 20). It's not the final state.
3. The rich man can SEE Abraham, TALK to him. Doesn't match modern hell.
4. His primary concern is WARNING HIS BROTHERS. Even in Hades, he's showing compassion.
5. Abraham says "they have Moses and the Prophets." Jesus is making a point about the PHARISEES, not building geography of the afterlife.

---

## What About "The Worm That Does Not Die"? (Mark 9:48)

Jesus is quoting **Isaiah 66:24** — *"they shall go forth and look upon the CORPSES."* Dead bodies. Not living people being tortured. Worms eat dead things. Unquenchable fire consumes COMPLETELY — it can't be PUT OUT, meaning it burns until there's nothing left.

The image is DESTRUCTION, not eternal torture. Things thrown into Gehenna were consumed. They didn't burn forever.

---

## What About "The Lake of Fire"? (Revelation 20:14-15)

The lake of fire is called **"the second DEATH."** Death. Not eternal life in torment.

If the wicked live forever in conscious torment, they have ETERNAL LIFE — just a painful version. But the Bible says the wages of sin is DEATH (Romans 6:23), not eternal living punishment.

**John 3:16** — The two options: everlasting life or PERISH. Not everlasting life or everlasting suffering. Perish. Apollymi (ἀπόλλυμι) — to destroy utterly.

---

## Where Did Eternal Conscious Torment Come From?

1. **Augustine of Hippo** (4th-5th century) — didn't read Greek, worked from Latin Vulgate
2. **The institutional church** — terrified people are obedient people
3. **Dante's Inferno** (1320) — a POEM, not theology
4. **Medieval Catholic art** — demons with pitchforks became the dominant visual
5. **Jonathan Edwards** — "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" (1741)

None of that is Scripture. It's tradition, poetry, art, and preaching built on mistranslated words.

---

## The Real Question

Is God — who IS love (1 John 4:8), who desires ALL men to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4), whose mercy endures forever (Psalm 136, 26 times), who takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 33:11) — going to torture billions of people for infinite time for finite sins committed during a 70-year life they didn't ask for?

The doctrine of eternal conscious torment doesn't reveal God's justice. It assassinates His character.
