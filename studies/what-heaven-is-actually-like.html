          Ask someone what heaven looks like and you will get clouds, harps, white robes, and people floating around as disembodied spirits singing worship songs for eternity. Maybe some pearly gates. Maybe some angels with wings. The whole picture looks suspiciously like a Renaissance painting crossed with a Hallmark card&mdash;and almost none of it comes from the Bible. What Scripture actually describes is so much stranger, more physical, more beautiful, and more specific than the vague &ldquo;eternal church service in the sky&rdquo; that most Christians imagine. The Bible does not describe heaven as an escape <em>from</em> creation. It describes heaven as the <em>restoration</em> of creation&mdash;and the merging of God&rsquo;s realm with ours in a way that changes everything.
        </p>

        <p>
          The original languages&mdash;Hebrew and Greek&mdash;are far more precise than the English word &ldquo;heaven,&rdquo; which does enormous damage by making one word cover at least three completely different concepts. When Jesus says &ldquo;the kingdom of heaven is at hand,&rdquo; He is not talking about the same thing John describes in Revelation 21. When Paul says he was caught up to &ldquo;the third heaven,&rdquo; he is using a framework that most modern readers have never been taught. And when the prophets describe the age to come, they describe something that would shock most churchgoers: a <em>physical</em> world, with <em>physical</em> bodies, on a <em>renewed</em> earth, with God Himself dwelling <em>among</em> His people&mdash;not somewhere else entirely.
        </p>

        <p>
          This study will take you through every word that matters, in the language it was written, and let Scripture speak for itself about what is coming.
        </p>

        <h2>The Three Heavens &mdash; What the Bible Actually Means by &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo;</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          The English word &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; translates two different words&mdash;one Hebrew, one Greek&mdash;and both of them are used for multiple, distinct realities. Understanding which &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; is being discussed in any given passage is the first step to understanding what the Bible actually teaches.
        </p>

        <div class="hebrew-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</div>
          <div class="transliteration">shamayim</div>
          <div class="pronunciation">shah-MY-im</div>
          <div><a href="../lexicon/h8064.html" class="strongs-number" style="text-decoration:none;">H8064</a></div>
          <div class="word-definition">Heaven, heavens, sky, the expanse above. A dual/plural form, suggesting <em>multiple heavens</em> built into the word itself. Used 420 times in the OT. Covers the atmospheric sky (&ldquo;the birds of <em>shamayim</em>&rdquo;&mdash;Genesis 1:20), the celestial expanse (&ldquo;the stars of <em>shamayim</em>&rdquo;&mdash;Genesis 22:17), and the dwelling place of God (&ldquo;hear in <em>shamayim</em> Your dwelling place&rdquo;&mdash;1 Kings 8:30). The Hebrew word is inherently plural&mdash;there is not <em>one</em> heaven. There are <em>heavens</em>.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="greek-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#962;</div>

          <div><a href="../lexicon/g3772.html" class="strongs-number" style="text-decoration:none;">G3772</a></div>
          <div class="word-definition">Heaven, sky, the abode of God. Used 273 times in the NT. Like <em>shamayim</em>, it covers the atmosphere (Matthew 6:26&mdash;&ldquo;birds of the <em>ouranos</em>&rdquo;), the celestial realm (Matthew 24:29&mdash;&ldquo;stars shall fall from <em>ouranos</em>&rdquo;), and God&rsquo;s dwelling (Matthew 6:9&mdash;&ldquo;Our Father in <em>ouranos</em>&rdquo;). Often appears in the plural: <em>ouranoi</em>&mdash;&ldquo;the heavens.&rdquo;</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Paul explicitly references this multi-layered structure:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago&mdash;whether in the body I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know, God knows&mdash;such a one was caught up to the third heaven.
          <cite class="scripture-ref">&mdash; 2 Corinthians 12:2</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          <strong>The first heaven</strong>: the atmosphere&mdash;the sky you see when you look up. Where birds fly and clouds form. <strong>The second heaven</strong>: the celestial realm&mdash;the stars, the sun, the cosmos. What we would call &ldquo;outer space.&rdquo; <strong>The third heaven</strong>: the dwelling place of God Himself&mdash;what Paul also calls &ldquo;Paradise&rdquo; in the very next verse (2 Corinthians 12:4). This is not a physical location &ldquo;above&rdquo; the stars. It is a different dimension of reality entirely&mdash;the realm where God&rsquo;s presence is unmediated and His glory is fully manifest.
        </p>

        <div class="greek-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#963;&#959;&#962;</div>
          <div class="transliteration">paradeisos</div>
          <div class="pronunciation">pah-RAH-day-sos</div>
          <div><a href="../lexicon/g3857.html" class="strongs-number" style="text-decoration:none;">G3857</a></div>
          <div class="word-definition">Paradise, a garden, a park, an enclosed garden of delight. Borrowed from Old Persian <em>pairidaeza</em> (&ldquo;an enclosed park, a royal garden&rdquo;). The Septuagint uses this word for the Garden of Eden (Genesis 2:8). Jesus used it on the cross: &ldquo;Today you will be with Me in Paradise&rdquo; (Luke 23:43). Paul equates it with &ldquo;the third heaven&rdquo; (2 Corinthians 12:4). And it appears again in Revelation 2:7&mdash;&ldquo;the tree of life, which is in the <em>paradeisos</em> of God.&rdquo; Heaven is not a sterile, abstract realm. It is a <em>garden</em>. The story that began in a garden ends in a garden.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          That last detail is worth pausing on. The Bible begins in a garden (Genesis 2) and ends in a garden-city (Revelation 22). The tree of life appears in the first chapters and reappears in the last. The story is not about escaping earth for heaven. It is about God restoring what was lost in Eden&mdash;and doing it on a scale that dwarfs the original.
        </p>

        <h2>The Present Heaven vs. The Final Destination</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          Here is where most theology goes wrong. There are <em>two</em> stages, and they are radically different. The &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; where believers go at death is <strong>not</strong> the final destination. It is the intermediate state&mdash;real, glorious, in the presence of Christ&mdash;but it is temporary. The <em>final</em> destination is something far greater: the new heaven and new earth, where God dwells <em>with</em> humanity on a renewed, physical creation.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Stage 1: The Intermediate State (present heaven)</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          When a believer dies now, they go to be &ldquo;with Christ&rdquo; (Philippians 1:23), which Paul calls &ldquo;far better.&rdquo; They are &ldquo;absent from the body and present with the Lord&rdquo; (2 Corinthians 5:8). This is Paradise (Luke 23:43)&mdash;the third heaven. They are conscious, aware, at rest, and in the presence of God. But they are not yet in their final state. They do not yet have resurrection bodies. They are waiting for something.
        </p>

        <p>
          (For more on this intermediate state, see our study: <a href="where-do-believers-go-when-they-die.html">Where Do Believers Go When They Die</a>.)
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Stage 2: The New Heaven and New Earth (final destination)</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          This is what Revelation 21&ndash;22 describes. This is the <em>telos</em>&mdash;the end goal, the final purpose, what everything has been building toward. And here is the stunning part: <strong>heaven comes <em>down</em></strong>. God does not take us away from earth. He brings heaven <em>to</em> earth. The two realms merge. God dwells <em>with</em> humanity on a renewed creation.
        </p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, &ldquo;Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God.&rdquo;
          <cite class="scripture-ref">&mdash; Revelation 21:3</cite>

          <div class="word-definition">Tabernacle, tent, dwelling, booth. The same word used for the tabernacle in the wilderness (Acts 7:44). God&rsquo;s <em>sk&#275;n&#275;</em>&mdash;His dwelling&mdash;is <strong>with men</strong>. Not men going up to God. God coming down to men. The entire trajectory of Scripture is not humanity ascending to heaven but God descending to earth. The incarnation was the preview. The New Jerusalem is the permanent reality.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="greek-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#963;&#954;&#951;&#957;&#972;&#969;</div>

          <div><a href="../lexicon/g4637.html" class="strongs-number" style="text-decoration:none;">G4637</a></div>
          <div class="word-definition">To dwell, to pitch a tent, to tabernacle, to take up residence. &ldquo;He will <em>sk&#275;no&#333;</em> with them&rdquo;&mdash;He will <em>tent</em> among them, set up permanent residence. This is the same word John uses in John 1:14: &ldquo;The Word became flesh and <em>dwelt</em> (<em>esk&#275;n&#333;sen</em>) among us.&rdquo; What happened temporarily in the incarnation becomes permanent in the new creation. God <em>moves in</em>.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Read that again. God does not say &ldquo;I will bring you up to My dwelling.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;<strong>My dwelling is with you.</strong>&rdquo; The direction of travel in Scripture is consistently <em>downward</em>: God comes to us. The New Jerusalem comes <em>down</em> out of heaven (Revelation 21:2). The entire point is not escape from creation but the <em>redemption</em> of creation.
        </p>

        <h2>The New Heaven and New Earth</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          The final state is not &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; as most people imagine it. It is a renewed cosmos&mdash;a new heaven <em>and</em> a new earth. The Greek words are critical:
        </p>

        <div class="greek-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#954;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#962;</div>
          <div class="transliteration">kainos</div>
          <div class="pronunciation">kai-NOS</div>
          <div><a href="../lexicon/g2537.html" class="strongs-number" style="text-decoration:none;">G2537</a></div>
          <div class="word-definition">New in quality, new in kind, fresh, unprecedented. NOT <em>neos</em> (<a href="../lexicon/g3501.html" style="color:var(--ultramarine);text-decoration:none;">G3501</a>&mdash;new in time, recently made). When Revelation 21:1 says &ldquo;a <em>new</em> (<em>kainos</em>) heaven and a <em>new</em> (<em>kainos</em>) earth,&rdquo; it does not mean the old one is destroyed and replaced from scratch. It means the old one is <strong>renewed, transformed, made qualitatively new</strong>. Same creation, gloriously remade. Not discarded. Redeemed.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          This distinction between <em>kainos</em> and <em>neos</em> is essential. If John had used <em>neos</em>, it would mean a completely different earth&mdash;a replacement. He used <em>kainos</em>&mdash;the same earth, made new in <em>quality</em>. Renewed. Restored. Upgraded. This aligns with what Paul says in Romans 8:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it in hope; because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
          <cite class="scripture-ref">&mdash; Romans 8:19&ndash;21</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <div class="greek-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#948;&#959;&#954;&#943;&#945;</div>

          <div class="word-definition">Eager expectation, anxious anticipation, stretching the neck forward to see something coming. Compound of <em>apo</em> (&ldquo;away from&rdquo;) + <em>kara</em> (&ldquo;head&rdquo;) + <em>dokeo</em> (&ldquo;to watch, to expect&rdquo;). Literally: <em>craning the neck forward in intense anticipation</em>. Creation itself is straining forward, eager, desperate for the day it will be set free. The earth is not destined for destruction. It is destined for <em>liberation</em>.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Creation is groaning&mdash;not for annihilation, but for <em>delivery</em>. The same word used for a woman in labor (<em>synodin&#333;</em>, Romans 8:22). The earth is in labor pains, waiting to give birth to its own renewal. The final state is not the absence of earth. It is earth <em>healed</em>. Earth <em>glorified</em>. Earth set free from the curse that has bound it since Genesis 3.
        </p>

        <h2>The New Jerusalem &mdash; The City That Comes Down</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          Revelation 21&ndash;22 gives the most detailed physical description of the final dwelling place in all of Scripture. Whether the measurements are literal or symbolic (and there are good arguments for both), the sheer specificity is striking. God is not vague about what is coming.
        </p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
          <cite class="scripture-ref">&mdash; Revelation 21:2</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <div class="greek-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#7993;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#955;&#8052;&#956; &#954;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#942;</div>

          <div class="word-definition">New Jerusalem. <em>Hierousal&#275;m</em> = the holy city, from Hebrew <em>Yerushalayim</em> (possibly &ldquo;foundation of peace&rdquo; or &ldquo;city of shalom&rdquo;). <em>Kain&#275;</em> = new in kind. The New Jerusalem is not a renovated version of the earthly city. It is qualitatively new&mdash;coming <em>down from God</em>, prepared, adorned. It is described as both a city and a bride. Architecture and intimacy fused into one image.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          John then gives dimensions:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          The city is laid out as a square; its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed: twelve thousand stadia. Its length, breadth, and height are equal.
          <cite class="scripture-ref">&mdash; Revelation 21:16</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Twelve thousand stadia is approximately 1,400 miles (2,200 kilometers). The city is a <em>cube</em>&mdash;equal in length, breadth, and height. This is not a random shape. The only other perfect cube in Scripture is the Holy of Holies in Solomon&rsquo;s temple (1 Kings 6:20&mdash;20 cubits in every direction). The entire New Jerusalem <em>is</em> the Holy of Holies. The place where God&rsquo;s presence was concentrated in one room in one building in one city&mdash;that presence now fills a city the size of a continent. From one room to a cosmos.
        </p>

        <p>
          The description continues with staggering detail:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Walls of jasper</strong> (Revelation 21:18)&mdash;a crystalline stone, possibly diamond or translucent quartz. The wall is 144 cubits (~216 feet / 65 meters) thick.</li>
          <li><strong>The city itself is pure gold, like clear glass</strong> (Revelation 21:18)&mdash;gold that is <em>transparent</em>. A material that does not exist in current physics. New creation physics.</li>
          <li><strong>Twelve foundation stones</strong>, each a different precious gem (Revelation 21:19&ndash;20)&mdash;jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysoprase, jacinth, amethyst. These are not decoration. They are <em>structure</em>. The city is built on color and light.</li>
          <li><strong>Twelve gates, each a single pearl</strong> (Revelation 21:21)&mdash;this is where &ldquo;pearly gates&rdquo; comes from, but notice: each gate is <em>one pearl</em>. Not pearl-decorated. A single, enormous pearl. And the gates are never shut (Revelation 21:25).</li>
          <li><strong>The street is pure gold, transparent as glass</strong> (Revelation 21:21).</li>
          <li><strong>A river of the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb</strong> (Revelation 22:1).</li>
          <li><strong>The tree of life, bearing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit every month</strong> (Revelation 22:2)&mdash;Eden restored and amplified. The tree that was lost in Genesis 3 is returned in Revelation 22.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Is NOT There &mdash; The Absences That Define It</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          Revelation 21&ndash;22 describes the new creation as much by what is <em>absent</em> as by what is present. And these absences are described with a Greek phrase that hits like a hammer:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.

God&rsquo;s presence is everywhere, unmediated. The entire city is the Holy of Holies.</li>
          <li><strong>The sun and moon</strong> (21:23)&mdash;&ldquo;the city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it. The Lamb is its light.&rdquo; Not darkness. <em>More</em> light than the sun could provide.</li>
          <li><strong>The curse</strong> (22:3)&mdash;&ldquo;there shall be no more curse.&rdquo; The curse of Genesis 3 is <em>undone</em>. Thorns, sweat, pain in childbirth, death&mdash;all gone. The ground no longer resists. Creation cooperates with humanity again.</li>

        <h2>Resurrection Bodies &mdash; You Will Be Physical</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          One of the most persistent and most unbiblical ideas about heaven is that we will be disembodied spirits&mdash;ghosts floating in a spiritual realm. Paul dedicates all of 1 Corinthians 15 to demolishing this idea. The Christian hope is not the <em>escape</em> from the body. It is the <em>resurrection</em> of the body.
        </p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          So also is the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.

Just as a &ldquo;natural body&rdquo; (<em>s&#333;ma psychikon</em>) is a body animated by the soul, a &ldquo;spiritual body&rdquo; is a body animated by the Spirit. It is still a body.

Same hardware, infinitely better operating system.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          The proof that resurrection bodies are physical is Jesus Himself. After His resurrection, He was not a ghost:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>He was touched.</strong> &ldquo;Handle Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have&rdquo; (Luke 24:39). He explicitly said He had <em>flesh and bones</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>He ate food.</strong> &ldquo;They gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb. And He took it and ate in their presence&rdquo; (Luke 24:42&ndash;43). Ghosts do not eat fish.</li>
          <li><strong>He was recognized.</strong> Mary recognized His voice (John 20:16). The disciples on the road to Emmaus recognized Him in the breaking of bread (Luke 24:30&ndash;31).</li>
          <li><strong>He had scars.</strong> &ldquo;Reach your finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side&rdquo; (John 20:27). His body bore the marks of the cross.</li>
          <li><strong>He also did things normal bodies cannot.</strong> He appeared in a locked room (John 20:19). He vanished from sight (Luke 24:31). He ascended into heaven (Acts 1:9). Physical&mdash;but not limited by current physics.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Jesus&rsquo;s resurrection body is the prototype. &ldquo;Who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body&rdquo; (Philippians 3:21). Your resurrection body will be like His: physical, tangible, capable of eating and being touched&mdash;but also glorified, imperishable, and no longer subject to death, decay, or the limitations of fallen physics.

        <h2>What Will We Do? &mdash; Reign, Create, Explore</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          The most common fear about heaven is boredom. An eternal church service. Singing one song forever. Floating on a cloud with nothing to do. This reveals how far the popular imagination has drifted from what Scripture actually describes. The Bible says we will <em>reign</em>:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          And they shall reign forever and ever.
          <cite class="scripture-ref">&mdash; Revelation 22:5</cite>

          <div class="pronunciation">bah-sil-YOO-oh</div>
          <div><a href="../lexicon/g936.html" class="strongs-number" style="text-decoration:none;">G936</a></div>
          <div class="word-definition">To reign, to exercise kingly authority, to rule. From <em>basileus</em> (&ldquo;king&rdquo;&mdash;<a href="../lexicon/g935.html" style="color:var(--ultramarine);text-decoration:none;">G935</a>). Believers will reign&mdash;not as figureheads, but as active rulers. Over what? Paul says believers will judge angels (1 Corinthians 6:3). Jesus said the faithful servant would be set over ten cities (Luke 19:17). The scope of this governance is cosmic, not ceremonial.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          The original mandate given to humanity in Genesis 1:28 was to &ldquo;fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion.&rdquo; That mandate was never rescinded&mdash;it was corrupted by the fall. In the new creation, it is restored and expanded. Humanity was designed to be co-rulers with God over creation. That is what we will finally, fully do.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the Bible also describes <em>service</em>:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          His servants shall serve Him. They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads.
          <cite class="scripture-ref">&mdash; Revelation 22:3&ndash;4</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <div class="greek-block">

          <div class="word-definition">To serve, to worship, to render sacred service. From <em>latris</em> (&ldquo;a servant&rdquo;). In the NT, <em>latreu&#333;</em> covers both worship and active service&mdash;because in God&rsquo;s economy, they are the same thing. To serve God <em>is</em> worship. To worship God <em>is</em> service. There is no sacred/secular divide. All of life in the new creation is both.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          And notice the staggering promise in verse 4: &ldquo;<strong>They shall see His face.</strong>&rdquo; In the Old Testament, no one could see God&rsquo;s face and live (Exodus 33:20). Moses only saw God&rsquo;s back (Exodus 33:23). In the new creation, you will see His face directly. The veil is not merely torn&mdash;it is gone. No more indirect encounter. No more seeing &ldquo;through a glass, darkly&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 13:12). Face to face. Direct. Unmediated. The intimacy that humanity lost in Eden is fully restored.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond reigning and serving, the Bible hints at dimensions we can barely imagine. Isaiah describes the new creation in terms of building, planting, and enjoying the work of your hands:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit. They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat&hellip; My elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
          <cite class="scripture-ref">&mdash; Isaiah 65:21&ndash;22</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Building. Planting. Creating. Enjoying. This is not an abstract spiritual existence. This is <em>life</em>&mdash;real, physical, creative, productive, satisfying life. Without the curse. Without futility. Without the frustration of building something only to watch it decay or be taken away. You will build and inhabit. Plant and eat. Create and enjoy. <em>Forever</em>.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          Jesus described the kingdom of heaven as a banquet repeatedly: the parable of the wedding feast (Matthew 22:1&ndash;14), the great supper (Luke 14:15&ndash;24), and His own promise at the Last Supper: &ldquo;I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father&rsquo;s kingdom&rdquo; (Matthew 26:29). He is waiting to share a meal with you. Physically. With real wine. At a real table. In a real kingdom. That is the promise.

What was lost in the garden is returned in the city. The circle closes.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          The entire narrative of Scripture is a circle: garden to garden-city, tree of life to tree of life, God walking with humanity in the cool of the day (Genesis 3:8) to God dwelling permanently among His people (Revelation 21:3). Heaven is not a departure from the story. It is the <em>conclusion</em> of the story. Everything that was lost is restored. Everything that was broken is healed. Everything that was corrupted is made new.

        <h2>What the Prophets Saw</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          The Old Testament prophets consistently describe the age to come in physical, earthly terms&mdash;not as an escape from the material world but as its transformation:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the young goat, the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them&hellip; They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.

        </blockquote>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with singing, with everlasting joy on their heads. They shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
          <cite class="scripture-ref">&mdash; Isaiah 35:10</cite>

        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Animals at peace. Joy without end. Sorrow permanently gone. New creation that makes the old seem forgettable. And all of it on <em>earth</em>&mdash;a renewed, healed, glorified earth. This is not &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; in the sense of &ldquo;immaterial.&rdquo; It is spiritual in the sense of &ldquo;Spirit-animated.&rdquo; Physical reality infused with the unchecked, unmediated presence of God.
        </p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          Heaven is not an escape from creation. It is the <em>redemption</em> of creation. The final destiny of believers is not disembodied existence in the clouds. It is <em>physical</em> life in <em>resurrection</em> bodies on a <em>renewed</em> earth in a <em>city</em> that comes <em>down from God</em>&mdash;where He dwells <em>with</em> us, face to face, forever.

          The curse is removed. Death is abolished. Tears are wiped away&mdash;not metaphorically but by God&rsquo;s own hand. The tree of life bears fruit every month. The river of life flows from the throne. The gates are never shut. The light is God Himself. And you will see His face.
        </p>

        <p>
          You will eat. You will build. You will create. You will reign. You will explore a creation unbound from entropy and decay, animated by the Spirit, lit by the glory of God, in a body that cannot die and a world that cannot fall. That is what is coming. Not harps on clouds. <em>A wedding feast in a city of gold on a new earth with the God of the universe living next door.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          And it will never end.
