        <p class="drop-cap">
          Ask the average churchgoer how to be saved and you will get some version of this: &ldquo;Accept Jesus into your heart. Pray the sinner&rsquo;s prayer. Believe that He died for your sins. Come forward during the altar call. Get baptized.&rdquo; It sounds so familiar, so established, so <em>Christian</em>, that most people assume it comes straight from Scripture. It does not. Not one syllable of the &ldquo;sinner&rsquo;s prayer&rdquo; appears anywhere in the Bible. The phrase &ldquo;accept Jesus into your heart&rdquo; does not exist in any manuscript in any language. The altar call was invented by Charles Finney in the 1830s. The &ldquo;repeat after me&rdquo; prayer was popularized by Billy Graham in the 1950s. We have been taught a procedure for salvation that is younger than the United States Constitution&mdash;and we have been told it comes from Jesus.
        </p>

        <p>
          So what <em>did</em> Jesus actually say about being saved? What do the original Greek words mean&mdash;the ones He and His apostles actually used? What is the &ldquo;narrow road&rdquo; that few find, and why does Jesus say that many who call Him &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; and perform miracles in His name will hear &ldquo;I never <em>knew</em> you&rdquo;?
        </p>

        <p>
          The answer, when you trace it through the Greek, is simultaneously simpler and more radical than anything religion has offered. It is not a formula. It is not a transaction. It is not a prayer you repeat and a box you check. It is a <em>person</em>. And the Greek words that describe it are so precise, so layered, and so deliberately chosen that flattening them into English slogans is not just reductive&mdash;it is dangerous.
        </p>

        <p>
          This study will take you through every word that matters, in the language it was written, with the meaning the original audience understood. By the end, the sinner&rsquo;s prayer will feel like what it is: a modern invention that replaced something infinitely deeper.
        </p>

        <h2>S&#333;z&#333; &mdash; What &ldquo;Saved&rdquo; Actually Means</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          Before we can discuss <em>how</em> we are saved, we need to understand what &ldquo;saved&rdquo; means&mdash;because the English word is tragically thin compared to the Greek. When modern Christians say &ldquo;saved,&rdquo; they almost always mean &ldquo;going to heaven when I die.&rdquo; That is a fraction of what the Greek says.
        </p>

        <div class="greek-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#963;&#974;&#950;&#969;</div>

          <div class="pronunciation">SOH-dzoh</div>
          <div><a href="../lexicon/g4982.html" class="strongs-number" style="text-decoration:none;">G4982</a></div>
          <div class="word-definition">To save, to deliver, to rescue, to heal, to make whole, to preserve, to restore to health. Used 106 times in the NT. This single word covers physical healing, deliverance from danger, rescue from death, spiritual regeneration, AND ultimate eschatological salvation. In the Gospels, Jesus uses <em>s&#333;z&#333;</em> interchangeably for healing the sick and saving the lost&mdash;because in the Hebrew mind, they are the same thing: <strong>restoration to wholeness</strong>.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Look at how Jesus uses this word:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mark 5:34</strong> &mdash; To the woman with the issue of blood: &ldquo;Your faith has <em>made you well</em> (<em>ses&#333;ken se</em>).&rdquo; Literally: &ldquo;Your faith has <em>saved</em> you.&rdquo;</li>
          <li><strong>Luke 7:50</strong> &mdash; To the sinful woman who anointed His feet: &ldquo;Your faith has <em>saved</em> you (<em>ses&#333;ken se</em>). Go in peace.&rdquo; Same exact Greek phrase. Same word for healing <em>and</em> forgiveness.</li>
          <li><strong>Luke 19:10</strong> &mdash; &ldquo;The Son of Man has come to seek and to <em>save</em> (<em>s&#333;sai</em>) that which was lost.&rdquo;</li>
          <li><strong>Acts 2:47</strong> &mdash; &ldquo;The Lord added to the church daily those who were being <em>saved</em> (<em>s&#333;zomenous</em>).&rdquo; Present passive participle&mdash;<strong>being saved</strong>. Not &ldquo;who got saved.&rdquo; An ongoing process.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The noun form is equally expansive:
        </p>

        <div class="greek-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#963;&#969;&#964;&#951;&#961;&#943;&#945;</div>
          <div class="transliteration">s&#333;t&#275;ria</div>
          <div class="pronunciation">soh-tay-REE-ah</div>
          <div><a href="../lexicon/g4991.html" class="strongs-number" style="text-decoration:none;">G4991</a></div>
          <div class="word-definition">Salvation, deliverance, preservation, wholeness, restoration. From <em>s&#333;t&#275;r</em> (&ldquo;savior, deliverer&rdquo;&mdash;<a href="../lexicon/g4990.html" style="color:var(--ultramarine);text-decoration:none;">G4990</a>). Covers the full spectrum: rescue from danger, healing of the body, deliverance from sin, regeneration of the spirit, ongoing transformation of the soul, and final glorification. It is past (you were saved), present (you are being saved), and future (you will be saved).</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          This is critical. Salvation in the New Testament is not a one-time event. It is described in <strong>three tenses</strong>:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Past</strong> &mdash; &ldquo;By grace you <em>have been saved</em> (<em>este ses&#333;smenoi</em>)&rdquo; (Ephesians 2:8). Perfect tense&mdash;completed action with ongoing results. Your spirit was reborn. Done.</li>
          <li><strong>Present</strong> &mdash; &ldquo;The message of the cross&hellip;to us who <em>are being saved</em> (<em>s&#333;zomenois</em>)&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 1:18). Present participle&mdash;an ongoing process. Your soul is being renewed.</li>
          <li><strong>Future</strong> &mdash; &ldquo;We shall <em>be saved</em> (<em>s&#333;th&#275;sometha</em>) from wrath through Him&rdquo; (Romans 5:9). Future tense&mdash;your body will be redeemed, creation will be restored.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When someone says &ldquo;I got saved,&rdquo; they are describing one-third of what <em>s&#333;z&#333;</em> means. They are past-tensing a word that Scripture uses in all three tenses simultaneously. Salvation is not a moment. It is a <em>life</em>. It has a beginning&mdash;but it does not stop there.
        </p>

        <h2>The Hebrew Foundation &mdash; Yasha</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          The Greek <em>s&#333;z&#333;</em> translates the Hebrew <em>yasha</em>, and the Hebrew adds dimensions the Greek alone does not convey. The name &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; itself comes from this root.
        </p>

        <div class="hebrew-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506;</div>
          <div class="transliteration">yasha</div>
          <div class="pronunciation">yah-SHAH</div>
          <div><a href="../lexicon/h3467.html" class="strongs-number" style="text-decoration:none;">H3467</a></div>
          <div class="word-definition">To save, to deliver, to rescue, to give victory, to help, to bring to a spacious place. The root carries the idea of being brought from a <em>narrow, constricted place</em> into a <em>wide, open, free space</em>. It is rescue from being hemmed in. The Hebrew name <em>Yehoshua</em> (Joshua/Jesus) means &ldquo;Yahweh saves&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yahweh brings to a wide place.&rdquo;</div>
        </div>

        <div class="hebrew-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</div>
          <div class="transliteration">yeshuah</div>
          <div class="pronunciation">yeh-shoo-AH</div>
          <div><a href="../lexicon/h3444.html" class="strongs-number" style="text-decoration:none;">H3444</a></div>
          <div class="word-definition">Salvation, deliverance, victory, rescue. The feminine noun form of <em>yasha</em>. When the Old Testament says &ldquo;the salvation of the Lord,&rdquo; this is the word. It is also the root of the name <em>Yeshua</em>&mdash;Jesus. His very name IS salvation. He does not just <em>bring</em> salvation. He <em>is</em> salvation.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          So salvation, from the Hebrew root, is not &ldquo;getting a ticket to heaven.&rdquo; It is being brought from constriction into freedom, from danger into safety, from brokenness into wholeness, from death into life. The whole person&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;being restored to what God intended. And the person who does this carries the name: <em>Yeshua</em>. Yahweh saves.
        </p>

        <h2>What Jesus Actually Said You Must Do</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          Strip away every tradition, every system, every denominational position paper. Go back to the red letters. What did Jesus Himself say was required? He said it plainly, repeatedly, and in shockingly few words.
        </p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel.
          <cite class="scripture-ref">&mdash; Mark 1:15</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Two commands. That is it. <em>Repent</em> and <em>believe</em>. But both of these words have been so distorted by religion that we need to excavate what they actually mean.
        </p>

        <div class="greek-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#941;&#969;</div>
          <div class="transliteration">metanoe&#333;</div>
          <div class="pronunciation">meh-tah-NOH-eh-oh</div>
          <div><a href="../lexicon/g3340.html" class="strongs-number" style="text-decoration:none;">G3340</a></div>
          <div class="word-definition">To change one&rsquo;s mind, to think differently after, to reconsider. Compound of <em>meta</em> (&ldquo;after, changed&rdquo;) + <em>noe&#333;</em> (&ldquo;to think, to perceive, to understand&rdquo;). This word has NOTHING to do with guilt, sorrow, or emotional anguish in its etymology. It is a <em>cognitive</em> word. A shift in perception. A change in how you understand reality. (See our full study: <a href="repent-does-not-mean-for-your-sins.html">Repent Does NOT Mean &ldquo;For Your Sins&rdquo;</a>)</div>
        </div>

        <div class="greek-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;</div>
          <div class="transliteration">pisteu&#333;</div>
          <div class="pronunciation">pis-TYOO-oh</div>
          <div><a href="../lexicon/g4100.html" class="strongs-number" style="text-decoration:none;">G4100</a></div>
          <div class="word-definition">To believe, to trust, to be persuaded, to commit to, to entrust oneself to. From <em>pistis</em> (&ldquo;faith, trust, persuasion&rdquo;&mdash;<a href="../lexicon/g4102.html" style="color:var(--ultramarine);text-decoration:none;">G4102</a>). This is not intellectual agreement. It is full-weight, life-staking trust. The kind of trust that changes how you live&mdash;because you are persuaded of something so deeply that you act on it without hesitation.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          So Mark 1:15 says: <em>Change how you perceive reality&mdash;and throw your entire weight onto the good news</em>. That is the entry point. Not a prayer. Not a formula. A paradigm shift followed by radical trust.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the most revealing construction in the entire New Testament comes from how <em>pisteu&#333;</em> is used with a specific preposition:
        </p>

        <h2>Pisteu&#333; Eis &mdash; Believe INTO</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          When Jesus says &ldquo;believe <em>in</em> Me,&rdquo; the English obscures something extraordinary. There are three different Greek constructions that English translates as &ldquo;believe in,&rdquo; and they mean radically different things:
        </p>

        <div class="greek-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969; &#8005;&#964;&#953;</div>
          <div class="transliteration">pisteu&#333; hoti</div>
          <div class="pronunciation">pis-TYOO-oh HOH-tee</div>
          <div><span class="strongs-number"><a href="../lexicon/g4100.html" style="color:var(--ultramarine);text-decoration:none;">G4100</a> + <a href="../lexicon/g3754.html" style="color:var(--ultramarine);text-decoration:none;">G3754</a></span></div>
          <div class="word-definition">To believe <em>that</em> something is true. Intellectual assent. &ldquo;I believe that God exists.&rdquo; &ldquo;I believe that Jesus is the Messiah.&rdquo; This is the <em>weakest</em> form of belief. It is factual agreement. <strong>Even demons have this</strong> (James 2:19).</div>
        </div>

        <div class="greek-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969; + dative</div>
          <div class="transliteration">pisteu&#333; + dative case</div>
          <div class="pronunciation">pis-TYOO-oh</div>
          <div><a href="../lexicon/g4100.html" class="strongs-number" style="text-decoration:none;">G4100</a></div>
          <div class="word-definition">To believe <em>someone</em>&mdash;to credit them, to accept what they say as true. &ldquo;I believe God&rdquo; (as in, I believe what He tells me). Abraham &ldquo;believed God (<em>episteusen t&#333; the&#333;</em>), and it was credited to him as righteousness&rdquo; (Romans 4:3). Stronger than <em>hoti</em>&mdash;you trust the person, not just the proposition.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="greek-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969; &#949;&#7984;&#962;</div>

          <div><span class="strongs-number"><a href="../lexicon/g4100.html" style="color:var(--ultramarine);text-decoration:none;">G4100</a> + <a href="../lexicon/g1519.html" style="color:var(--ultramarine);text-decoration:none;">G1519</a></span></div>
          <div class="word-definition">To believe <em>into</em>. This is the strongest construction&mdash;and it is the one Jesus uses most often. The preposition <em>eis</em> (<a href="../lexicon/g1519.html" style="color:var(--ultramarine);text-decoration:none;">G1519</a>) means &ldquo;into, toward, unto&rdquo;&mdash;it implies <strong>movement and union</strong>. You are not just believing facts about Jesus. You are not just believing what He says. You are placing yourself <em>into</em> Him. Your identity enters His identity. It is relational, directional, and total. This construction is almost exclusive to the New Testament&mdash;it is rare in secular Greek, as if the biblical writers needed a new expression for a new kind of trust.</div>
        </div>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes <strong>into</strong> Him should not perish but have everlasting life.

        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Every time Jesus says &ldquo;believe in Me&rdquo; in the Gospel of John, He uses <em>pisteu&#333; eis</em>. Not &ldquo;believe <em>that</em> I exist.&rdquo; Not &ldquo;believe what I say.&rdquo; <em>Believe <strong>into</strong> Me.</em> Place yourself inside Me. Stake your existence on union with Me. This is not a mental exercise. It is a <em>relocation of identity</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is the difference between believing a bridge can hold you and <em>walking across it</em>. Between believing a parachute works and <em>jumping out of the plane</em>. The preposition <em>eis</em> turns intellectual belief into existential commitment. You go <em>into</em> Christ.
        </p>

        <p>
          Paul captures this with a phrase he uses 89 times in his letters:

Not &ldquo;with Christ&rdquo; or &ldquo;near Christ&rdquo; or &ldquo;following Christ.&rdquo; <em>In</em> Christ. You are <em>inside</em> Him. He is your location. He is your identity. He is your address in the spirit realm. Everything you are, everything you have, everything you can do comes from being <em>in</em> Him.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          <em>Pisteu&#333; eis</em> is the action. <em>En Christ&#333;</em> is the result. You believe <em>into</em> Him, and you end up <em>in</em> Him. That is salvation. Not a transaction. A <em>union</em>.
        </p>

        <h2>Born from Above &mdash; Not &ldquo;Born Again&rdquo;</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          Everyone knows John 3:3. Almost everyone misreads it. &ldquo;You must be born again&rdquo; is such a cultural fixture that entire denominations are named after it. But the Greek word Jesus used is not &ldquo;again.&rdquo;

          If salvation were a transaction&mdash;pray a prayer, check a box, get a ticket&mdash;then Matthew 7:21&ndash;23 would make no sense.

In the Septuagint (the Greek OT), <em>gin&#333;sk&#333;</em> translates the Hebrew <em>yada</em>, which is the word used for a husband &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; his wife (Genesis 4:1).

        </div>

        <p>
          Jesus did not say &ldquo;your theology was wrong.&rdquo; He did not say &ldquo;your miracles were fake.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;I never <em>knew</em> you.&rdquo; They had <em>power</em> (<em>dynamis</em>) without <em>relationship</em> (<em>gin&#333;sk&#333;</em>). They had religious performance without intimate knowledge of the Person. They had ministry without <em>knowing</em> God.

        <h2>The Will of the Father</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          If &ldquo;doing the will of the Father&rdquo; is the requirement (Matthew 7:21), then we desperately need to know what that will is. Religion will hand you a list of rules. Jesus handed us a single verse:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes into Him may have everlasting life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
          <cite class="scripture-ref">&mdash; John 6:40 (Greek: &#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#8166;&#959;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#957;)</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The Father&rsquo;s will <em>is</em> belief. <em>Pisteu&#333; eis</em>. Believe <em>into</em> the Son. Not a list of 613 commandments. Not ten rules on stone tablets. Trust the Son. Place yourself into Him. That is the Father&rsquo;s will.
        </p>

        <p>
          And John makes it even more explicit:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          And this is His commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as He gave us commandment.

        </div>

        <p>
          Two things. Trust the Son. Love people. That is the entire will of the Father distilled to its essence. Not a behavior management program. Not a moral improvement plan. <em>Trust</em> and <em>love</em>. Everything else&mdash;every transformation, every good work, every fruit of the Spirit&mdash;grows organically from those two roots.

        <h2>Pistis &mdash; The Faith That Saves</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          We have already seen the verb <em>pisteu&#333;</em> (to believe/trust). Now we need to examine the noun, because Paul uses it to make one of the most consequential statements in all of Scripture:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.

It is not believing without evidence. It is <strong>being so thoroughly persuaded</strong> that you stake everything on it. It is the settled conviction that produces action. Hebrews 11:1 defines it: &ldquo;the substance (<em>hypostasis</em>) of things hoped for, the evidence (<em>elegchos</em>) of things not seen.&rdquo; Substance. Evidence. This is not wishful thinking. It is confident, grounded trust.</div>

Not merely &ldquo;unmerited favor&rdquo; (though it includes that). In its fullest sense, <em>charis</em> is God&rsquo;s <em>enabling power</em>&mdash;the divine empowerment to be and do what you cannot be or do in your own strength. Grace is not just permission. It is <em>power</em>.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          &ldquo;By <em>charis</em> you have been saved through <em>pistis</em>.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s enabling power, received through full-weight trust. Not your works. Not your effort. Not your religious performance. God&rsquo;s power, received by trust.
        </p>

        <p>
          And notice: &ldquo;that not of yourselves; it is the gift (<em>d&#333;ron</em>) of God.&rdquo; Even the faith is a gift. Even the <em>ability to trust</em> comes from God. You did not generate your own salvation. You did not manufacture your own faith. God gave you the capacity to trust, and when you used it, His grace activated. The entire process is initiated, sustained, and completed by God. You participate by <em>trusting</em>. That is your role. Trust.
        </p>

        <h2>Demons Believe &mdash; But They Don&rsquo;t Trust</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          James 2:19 is the verse that demolishes the idea that intellectual agreement equals saving faith:
        </p>

          <div class="word-definition">To shudder, to tremble with horror, to bristle (like hair standing on end). The demons do not merely &ldquo;believe that God exists.&rdquo; They <em>know</em> He exists. They are in His presence. They have seen His face. Their &ldquo;belief&rdquo; is <em>pisteu&#333; hoti</em>&mdash;factual knowledge. It is not <em>pisteu&#333; eis</em>&mdash;personal trust. They know God is real and it <em>terrifies</em> them. Knowledge without trust is not saving faith. It is just information that makes you shudder.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          So when someone says &ldquo;I believe in God&rdquo; and means &ldquo;I believe God exists,&rdquo; they have demon-level faith. Congratulations. They believe the same thing the demons believe. The demons are just more honest about what it implies&mdash;they tremble. Most &ldquo;believers&rdquo; do not even do that.
        </p>

        <p>
          Saving faith is not &ldquo;I believe God exists.&rdquo; It is &ldquo;I have placed myself <em>into</em> Christ and I am staking my entire existence on who He is and what He did.&rdquo; <em>Pisteu&#333; eis</em>. Not <em>pisteu&#333; hoti</em>. The preposition is everything.

        <p>
          <strong>Honesty.</strong> You cannot fake intimacy with God. You can fake religion for decades. You can attend services, quote verses, lead committees, and write checks. But you cannot fake <em>knowing</em> someone. David was a murderer and an adulterer&mdash;and he was called &ldquo;a man after God&rsquo;s own heart&rdquo; (Acts 13:22). Why? Not because of his behavior. Because of his <em>honesty</em>. Read the Psalms. David screamed at God, wept before God, raged at God, and worshipped God&mdash;all with raw, unfiltered honesty. God does not want your performance. He wants your <em>truth</em>.

This becomes THE model. Churches adopt it wholesale. Salvation becomes a <em>moment</em> defined by <em>words you repeat</em>. The entire New Testament concept of ongoing relationship, transformation, and intimate knowledge of God is compressed into 30 seconds at the front of a stadium.</div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          None of this makes Billy Graham a villain. The man was sincere. But sincere people can build systems that replace what Jesus actually said with something simpler, tidier, and far less demanding. &ldquo;Repeat after me&rdquo; is easier to manage than &ldquo;be born from above by the Spirit of the living God and spend the rest of your life knowing Him face to face.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <h2>What the Early Church Fathers Actually Taught</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          The Christians closest in time and language to the apostles understood salvation as transformation, not transaction. Here is what they actually said:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Irenaeus of Lyon</strong> (c. 130&ndash;202 AD), a student of Polycarp who was a student of John the Apostle: &ldquo;God became man so that man might become God&rdquo; (<em>Against Heresies</em>, Book V, preface). This is the doctrine of <em>theosis</em>&mdash;divinization. Not that humans become God in essence, but that they are <em>transformed</em> into the likeness of God, partaking of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4). Salvation is not escaping earth for heaven. It is being transformed into the image of Christ.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Clement of Alexandria</strong> (c. 150&ndash;215 AD): &ldquo;The Word of God became man, that you may learn from a man how a man may become God&rdquo; (<em>Exhortation to the Heathen</em>, Chapter 1). Salvation as participation in the divine nature. Not a legal transaction. A relational transformation.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Athanasius of Alexandria</strong> (c. 296&ndash;373 AD): &ldquo;He was made man that we might be made God&rdquo; (<em>On the Incarnation</em>, 54.3). The consistent witness of the first four centuries: salvation is about becoming something new, not just being forgiven.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>John Chrysostom</strong> (c. 349&ndash;407 AD), the &ldquo;Golden-Mouthed&rdquo; preacher of Constantinople, writing on Ephesians 2:8: &ldquo;He does not say &lsquo;through works,&rsquo; lest anyone should boast. It is faith alone that saves; but it is not a dead faith, a mere assent of the mind&mdash;for such a faith even the demons possess. It is a <em>working</em> faith, a faith that transforms, a faith that takes hold of Christ and will not let go.&rdquo; (<em>Homilies on Ephesians</em>, Homily 4). Even the greatest preacher of the ancient church knew the difference between <em>pisteu&#333; hoti</em> and <em>pisteu&#333; eis</em>.
        </p>

        <h2>The Process of Salvation &mdash; How It Actually Happens</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          With the Greek now open in front of us, here is what salvation actually looks like&mdash;not as a theological abstraction, but as a lived experience:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>1. Your spirit encounters God&rsquo;s Spirit.</strong> This can happen anywhere&mdash;in a cathedral, in a prison cell, at 3 AM on a bathroom floor, in a field, in the middle of an argument. There is no required location, no required ceremony, no required human mediator. It is a <em>meeting</em>. Spirit touches Spirit. God reveals Himself. The initiative is His (John 6:44&mdash;&ldquo;No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him&rdquo;).
        </p>

        <div class="greek-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#7957;&#955;&#954;&#969;</div>
          <div class="transliteration">helk&#333;</div>
          <div class="pronunciation">HEL-koh</div>
          <div><a href="../lexicon/g1670.html" class="strongs-number" style="text-decoration:none;">G1670</a></div>
          <div class="word-definition">To draw, to drag, to pull toward. The same word used for drawing a net full of fish (John 21:6) and drawing a sword (John 18:10). This is not a gentle suggestion. It is a powerful pull. God <em>draws</em> people to Himself. He initiates. He pursues. He creates the conditions for the encounter. Salvation begins with God acting, not with a human deciding.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          <strong>2. Metanoia happens.</strong> Your perception shifts. The old way of seeing reality cracks open. You begin to see the kingdom. You begin to see yourself differently&mdash;not as the self-sufficient person you thought you were, but as someone desperately in need of God. This is not an emotion (though emotions may accompany it). It is a cognitive and spiritual paradigm shift at the deepest level.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>3. Pistis activates.</strong> You throw your weight onto it. Not &ldquo;I think this is probably true&rdquo; but &ldquo;I am staking my life on this.&rdquo; <em>Pisteu&#333; eis</em>&mdash;you step <em>into</em> Christ. This might come with words. It might come in silence. It might come with tears or with laughter or with nothing at all. God is not checking your technique. He is checking your heart.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>4. Your spirit is reborn.</strong> Not reformed&mdash;<em>reborn</em>. Born from above (<em>an&#333;then</em>). <em>Kain&#275; ktisis</em>&mdash;new creation. This is the moment your dead spirit comes alive (Ephesians 2:1, 5). You enter the covenant&mdash;not because you earned it, but because the covenant was already cut by God alone (Genesis 15&mdash;see our study on <a href="blood-covenants-why-jesus-had-to-die.html">Blood Covenants</a>). You step into what was already prepared.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>5. The journey begins.</strong> <em>S&#333;t&#275;ria</em> in its fullness. Salvation is not the finish line. It is the starting gate. Now begins:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Renewing your mind</strong> (<em>anakainosis</em>, Romans 12:2)&mdash;your soul catching up to your spirit</li>
          <li><strong>Learning to walk by the Spirit</strong> (Galatians 5:16)&mdash;spirit leading, soul following</li>
          <li><strong>Discovering your identity <em>en Christ&#333;</em></strong>&mdash;who you actually are now</li>
          <li><strong>Exercising your authority</strong> (<em>exousia</em>)&mdash;the delegated right to act in His name (see our study on <a href="authority-vs-power-why-your-prayers-dont-work.html">Authority vs Power</a>)</li>
          <li><strong>Growing in intimacy</strong> (<em>gin&#333;sk&#333;</em>)&mdash;knowing Him deeper, face to face, Spirit to Spirit</li>
          <li><strong>Being transformed</strong> from glory to glory (2 Corinthians 3:18)&mdash;becoming the new creation you already are</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="greek-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;</div>

          <div><a href="../lexicon/g342.html" class="strongs-number" style="text-decoration:none;">G342</a></div>
          <div class="word-definition">Renewal, renovation, complete transformation. From <em>ana</em> (&ldquo;again, from above&rdquo;) + <em>kainos</em> (&ldquo;new in kind&rdquo;). The renewing of the mind (Romans 12:2) is not thinking harder or memorizing more verses. It is the progressive transformation of your entire way of perceiving reality&mdash;your <em>nous</em> (mind) being renovated by the Spirit to think the way God thinks.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="greek-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#972;&#969;</div>

          <div><a href="../lexicon/g3339.html" class="strongs-number" style="text-decoration:none;">G3339</a></div>
          <div class="word-definition">To transform, to change form, to transfigure. The root of English &ldquo;metamorphosis.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be <em>transformed</em> by the renewing of your mind&rdquo; (Romans 12:2) and &ldquo;we are being <em>transformed</em> from glory to glory&rdquo; (2 Corinthians 3:18). This is the same word used for Jesus&rsquo;s transfiguration on the mountain (Matthew 17:2)&mdash;an outward manifestation of inward reality. You are being <em>metamorphosed</em>. Changed from the inside out. Your spirit is already new; your soul is being transformed; your body will be redeemed.</div>
        </div>

        <h2>The Treasure in the Field</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          Jesus told a one-verse parable that captures everything we have said in a single image:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
          <cite class="scripture-ref">&mdash; Matthew 13:44</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Notice: he did not sell everything out of <em>obligation</em>. He sold everything out of <strong>joy</strong>. Because what he found was worth infinitely more than everything he had. The narrow road costs you everything&mdash;your self-sovereignty, your religious performance, your need to be in control, your reputation within the system. And it is worth infinitely more than what you gave up.
        </p>

        <div class="greek-block">
          <div class="original-word">&#967;&#945;&#961;&#940;</div>
          <div class="transliteration">chara</div>
          <div class="pronunciation">khar-AH</div>
          <div><a href="../lexicon/g5479.html" class="strongs-number" style="text-decoration:none;">G5479</a></div>
          <div class="word-definition">Joy, gladness, delight. From the same root as <em>charis</em> (grace). The man does not sell everything because God is forcing him. He sells everything because what he found is so valuable, so precious, so beyond anything he currently possesses, that letting go of everything else is not sacrifice&mdash;it is common sense. This is the joy of salvation. Not grim duty. <em>Joy</em>.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          That is the narrow road. It is not a tightrope you might fall off. It is an intimate path walked with God where most people simply choose not to go&mdash;because the wide road is easier, has more company, and does not require you to leave anything behind.
        </p>

        <p>
          Few find it. Not because it is hidden. But because few are willing to sell everything for the treasure.
        </p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          Salvation is not a formula. It is not a transaction. It is not a prayer you repeat and a box you check and a ticket you receive. It is a <em>Person</em>. Knowing Him&mdash;<em>gin&#333;sk&#333;</em>, intimate, experiential, face-to-face. Trusting Him&mdash;<em>pisteu&#333; eis</em>, believing <em>into</em> Him so completely that your identity relocates. Being reborn from above&mdash;<em>genna&#333; an&#333;then</em>, a new creation that has never existed before. And then walking with Him, daily, as your mind is renewed and your soul is transformed and you become, from glory to glory, the person He made you to be before the foundation of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          The sinner&rsquo;s prayer is 200 years old. The narrow road is eternal. The sinner&rsquo;s prayer asks you to repeat words. The narrow road asks you to surrender your life. The sinner&rsquo;s prayer gives you a moment. The narrow road gives you a Person.
        </p>

        <p>
          The road is narrow. But the One who walks it with you is worth everything.
