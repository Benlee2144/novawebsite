        <h2>The Manuscripts Are Intact</h2>

        <p class="drop-cap">The Bible itself was not changed. The Hebrew manuscripts in the Dead Sea Scrolls match the Masoretic text we use today with stunning accuracy across a thousand years of copying. The Greek New Testament manuscripts&mdash;over 5,800 of them&mdash;give us a text that textual scholars consider remarkably stable. <a href="../lexicon/g3341.html"><em>Metanoia</em></a> still means <em>metanoia</em>. <a href="../lexicon/g166.html"><em>Aionios</em></a> still means <em>aionios</em>. <a href="../lexicon/g1577.html"><em>Ekklesia</em></a> still means <em>ekklesia</em>. The source has not been corrupted.</p>

        <p>What got corrupted is the <strong>lens</strong> we read it through&mdash;translations, traditions, doctrines built on top of the text by people who had more interest in controlling than in communicating.</p>

        <p>God preserved His word. The Greek and Hebrew are still there for anyone willing to dig. The problem is that most people don&rsquo;t dig. They trust the English translation and the pastor&rsquo;s interpretation and never go deeper.</p>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h2>Why It Got Twisted: Power and Money</h2>

        <p>When Christianity went from an underground movement to the official religion of the Roman Empire under Constantine (313 AD), everything changed. The faith that was about knowing God personally became an <strong>institution</strong>. And institutions need:</p>

        <div class="hebrew-block">
          <p><strong>Buildings</strong> &mdash; so <a href="../lexicon/g1577.html"><em>ekklesia</em></a> (assembly of called-out ones) becomes &ldquo;church&rdquo;</p>
          <p><strong>Revenue</strong> &mdash; so free-will giving becomes mandatory tithing</p>
          <p><strong>Control</strong> &mdash; so &ldquo;change your mind&rdquo; (<a href="../lexicon/g3340.html"><em>metanoeo</em></a>) becomes &ldquo;do penance through us&rdquo;</p>
          <p><strong>Hierarchy</strong> &mdash; so elder-led communities become <a href="../lexicon/g4166.html">pastor</a>-dominated institutions</p>
          <p><strong>Fear</strong> &mdash; so &ldquo;<a href="../lexicon/g166.html">age-lasting</a> consequences&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;eternal torture if you leave&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <p>Every single twist serves the institution. Every one. That is not a coincidence. For the full evidence on each of these, see our study: <a href="things-twisted-in-the-bible-the-full-breakdown.html"><strong>Things Twisted In The Bible &mdash; The Full Breakdown</strong></a>.</p>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h2>Did God Allow It?</h2>

        <p>God allows a great many things He does not endorse. He allowed Israel to demand a king when He wanted to be their king (<a href="../interlinear/1sa-8.html">1 Samuel 8</a>). He told Samuel: &ldquo;They have not rejected you&mdash;they have rejected Me.&rdquo; But He let them do it. And then He worked <strong>through</strong> the broken system&mdash;David came out of that monarchy. Jesus came through David&rsquo;s line.</p>

        <p>God allows humans to make choices&mdash;even terrible ones&mdash;and then redeems the mess. He is not a micromanager. He is a Father who lets His children make mistakes and then meets them in the wreckage.</p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          They have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them.
          <cite class="scripture-ref">&mdash; <a href="../interlinear/1sa-8.html" style="color:inherit;">1 Samuel 8:7</a></cite>
        </blockquote>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h2>Jesus Predicted This Would Happen</h2>

        <p>The warnings are scattered throughout the New Testament. They were not afterthoughts. They were direct predictions:</p>

        <div class="key-verse-box">
          <p class="key-verse-ref"><a href="../interlinear/mat-7.html">Matthew 7:15</a></p>
          <p class="key-verse-text">&ldquo;Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-verse-box">
          <p class="key-verse-ref"><a href="../interlinear/act-20.html">Acts 20:29&ndash;30</a></p>
          <p class="key-verse-text">&ldquo;For I know this, that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. Also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-verse-box">
          <p class="key-verse-ref"><a href="../interlinear/2pe-2.html">2 Peter 2:1&ndash;3</a></p>
          <p class="key-verse-text">&ldquo;But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies&hellip; By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-verse-box">
          <p class="key-verse-ref"><a href="../interlinear/2ti-4.html">2 Timothy 4:3&ndash;4</a></p>
          <p class="key-verse-text">&ldquo;For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <p>They <strong>told</strong> us it was coming. It was not a surprise to God. He warned us, gave us the original text, gave us the Holy Spirit to lead us into truth (<a href="../interlinear/jhn-16.html">John 16:13</a>)&mdash;and then let humans be humans.</p>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h2>The Twisting Is A Test Of Hunger</h2>

        <p>The truth is <strong>right there</strong>. The Greek is available. Strong&rsquo;s Concordance is free online. <a href="../interlinear/">Interlinear Bibles</a> exist. Anyone with a phone can look up what <a href="../lexicon/g3341.html"><em>metanoia</em></a> actually means in thirty seconds. The information has <strong>never been more accessible</strong> than it is right now.</p>

        <p>So why don&rsquo;t people look?</p>

        <p>Because most people do not actually want truth. They want comfort. They want someone to tell them they are okay. They want a system that does the thinking for them. Sit in a pew, listen to a sermon, tithe ten percent, go home feeling good. That is easy. That is the wide road.</p>

        <p>Digging into the Greek, questioning traditions, thinking for yourself, going directly to God instead of through an institution&mdash;that is the narrow road. It costs you something. It might cost you your church community. Your family might think you are a heretic. Your pastor might say you are &ldquo;deceived.&rdquo;</p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it. Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it.
          <cite class="scripture-ref">&mdash; <a href="../interlinear/mat-7.html" style="color:inherit;">Matthew 7:13&ndash;14</a></cite>
        </blockquote>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h2>Hidden In Plain Sight &mdash; On Purpose</h2>

        <p>The twisted translations actually serve a purpose&mdash;they separate the hungry from the comfortable. The people who accept the surface reading stay on the surface. The people who feel something is off and dig deeper find the gold underneath.</p>

        <p>Jesus taught in parables for the same reason. The disciples asked why He did not just speak plainly. His answer is one of the most revealing statements in all of Scripture:</p>

        <div class="key-verse-box">
          <p class="key-verse-ref"><a href="../interlinear/mat-13.html">Matthew 13:11&ndash;12</a></p>
          <p class="key-verse-text">&ldquo;Because it has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For whoever has, to him more will be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <p>The truth is hidden in plain sight. Not hidden <strong>by</strong> God&mdash;hidden <strong>for</strong> the hungry. The ones who dig, find. The ones who do not, get the surface version and think that is all there is.</p>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h2>What This Means For You</h2>

        <p>God did not allow His word to be changed. He allowed humans to build traditions on top of it that obscure it. But He also made the original accessible to anyone willing to look.</p>

        <p>And He gave you a Spirit inside you that says &ldquo;something is not right here&rdquo; when you hear a twisted teaching&mdash;which is exactly what is happening when you are reading this right now.</p>

        <p>That nudge is not rebellion. That is your spirit recognizing truth and rejecting the counterfeit. That <strong>is</strong> God protecting His word&mdash;not by preventing bad translations, but by putting something inside you that can tell the difference.</p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">
          But the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you will abide in Him.
