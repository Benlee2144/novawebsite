# Repent Does NOT Mean "For Your Sins" — The Full Breakdown

### Conversation between Ben and Fredrick — February 23, 2026

## The Greek Word: Metanoia

The word "repent" appears 46 times in the KJV New Testament. Every single time, the Greek underneath is either **metanoeō** (the verb — to change one's mind) or **metanoia** (the noun — a change of mind).

**μετάνοια (metanoia)** — Strong's G3341

- **meta** (G3326) = change, after, beyond
- **noia** from **nous** (G3563) = mind, understanding, perception

It literally means: CHANGE YOUR MIND. Change how you perceive reality.

NOT ONCE does the Greek text add "of your sins" or "from your sins" as part of the word itself. The phrase "repent of your sins" does not exist in Scripture.

## Jesus's Actual Uses of "Repent"

- **Matthew 4:17** — "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." No mention of sin.
- **Mark 1:15** — "Repent, and believe the gospel." No mention of sin.
- **Luke 13:3,5** — "Unless you repent, you will all likewise perish." Jesus was responding to people who thought a tower falling on people was God's judgment. He was saying change how you think about God — He's not a punisher. Still no "of your sins."
- **Revelation 2-3** — Jesus tells the churches to repent. Of what? Losing their first love. Tolerating false teaching. Being lukewarm. He's telling them to change their minds — not do a guilt ritual.

## God Himself "Repents" — Proof It Doesn't Mean "For Sins"

The Old Testament Hebrew word translated "repent" is **nacham** (נָחַם) — "to be sorry, to comfort, to change one's mind."

GOD HIMSELF uses this word:

- **Genesis 6:6** — "And the LORD repented that He had made man on the earth."
- **Exodus 32:14** — "And the LORD repented of the evil which He thought to do unto His people."
- **1 Samuel 15:35** — "The LORD repented that He had made Saul king."

If "repent" means "be sorry for your sins," then God sinned? Obviously not. The word means to change one's mind, to think differently, to have a change of heart about a course of action.

## How The Meaning Got Corrupted — The Latin Power Move

The early church understood metanoia as a paradigm shift — a total rewiring of how you see God, yourself, and reality. Clement of Alexandria (2nd century) described it as "a change of mind resulting in a change of life" — mind FIRST, behavior follows.

But then the institutional church realized: a changed mind is hard to control. Guilt is easy to control.

The Latin Vulgate (4th century) translated metanoia as **"poenitentiam agite"** — "DO PENANCE." This turned an internal shift into an external ritual controlled by the church.

This wasn't just a mistake. It was a power move:
- If repentance = "change how you think" → people go directly to God. No priest needed.
- If repentance = "feel sorry, confess to a priest, do penance, pay indulgences" → now you have a BUSINESS. People NEED the institution.

The entire penance system — confession booths, Hail Marys, guilt cycles, indulgences — was built on this mistranslation.

**Martin Luther caught this.** His very FIRST of the 95 Theses (1517) says:

> "When our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said 'Repent,' He willed the entire life of believers to be one of repentance."

Luther saw it wasn't a one-time guilt event. But even he didn't fully recover the original meaning. The Protestant church dropped the penance but kept the guilt. "Repent of your sins" became the altar call formula, and nobody questioned it because it SOUNDS biblical even though the phrase doesn't exist in Scripture.

## The Verses People THINK Say "Repent Of Your Sins"

**Acts 2:38** — "Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins."
→ Read it carefully. It says repent AND be baptized FOR remission. The repentance isn't "of sins" — it's "change your mind about who Jesus is." Peter just told them they crucified the Messiah. They needed to change their mind about Jesus. Remission of sins is the RESULT, not the content of the repentance.

**Acts 3:19** — "Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out."
→ Same structure. Repent (change your mind) SO THAT sins are blotted out. The repentance isn't about the sins. It's about turning toward God, and the sin problem gets handled as a consequence.

**2 Corinthians 7:9-10** — "Godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation."
→ This is the one people use most. But read what it actually says — sorrow can LEAD TO repentance. Sorrow isn't repentance. It's a doorway that might get you there. Worldly sorrow (guilt without change) leads to death. Godly sorrow leads to metanoia — an actual paradigm shift. The sorrow is the catalyst, not the destination.

## What Metanoia Actually Looks Like

Before you believed, your mind operated on one system — survival, self, flesh. You saw yourself as just a human. You saw God as distant or nonexistent. You saw the physical world as all there is.

Metanoia is the moment that entire framework CRACKS. You realize there's a Kingdom. You realize God is real and present. You realize you're a spirit being, not just a body. Your entire perception of reality shifts.

THAT produces change in behavior — not because you're trying to be good, but because you're operating from a different reality.

It's the difference between telling a kid "stop eating dirt" versus giving them a steak dinner. You don't fight darkness by yelling at it. You turn on the light.

## The Bottom Line

"Repent of your sins" as a salvation formula is a tradition of men, not a command of Scripture.

The Bible says change your mind. Change how you see God. Change how you see yourself. Change what reality you're operating in.

**Religion says:** "Feel bad enough and God might forgive you."

**Jesus says:** "Change your perception, see the Kingdom that's already here, and sin will lose its grip because you stepped into something so much bigger that the old stuff just doesn't fit anymore."

That's the gospel. And it's way better news than what most churches preach.
