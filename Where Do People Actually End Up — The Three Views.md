## People ON The Narrow Road — Where Do They End Up?

**You don't "go to heaven." Heaven comes to YOU.**

**Revelation 21:2-3** — *"Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming DOWN out of heaven from God... 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is WITH MEN, and He will dwell WITH THEM.'"*

Heaven and Earth MERGE. God doesn't pull you out of creation. He renews creation and moves in permanently.

**Romans 8:21** — *"the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God."*

You get a resurrected, glorified body (1 Corinthians 15:42-44). Not a ghost. Not a spirit floating in a cloud dimension. A BODY. Like Jesus's resurrected body — He ate fish (Luke 24:42), He was touched (John 20:27). Physical but upgraded. No decay. No sickness. No death.

And you REIGN.

**Revelation 22:5** — *"They shall reign forever and ever."*
**Revelation 5:10** — *"And have made us kings and priests to our God; and we shall reign on the earth."*

ON THE EARTH. The job Adam was given in Genesis 2 — tend the garden, rule over creation — gets fully restored. Humanity finally does what it was designed to do.

**For those on the narrow road:** Resurrected body, renewed Earth, face-to-face communion with God, reigning over a restored creation, forever.

## People NOT On The Narrow Road — The Three Views

The Bible presents evidence that serious Christians have used to arrive at THREE different conclusions. All three existed in the early church.

---

### View 1: Annihilationism / Conditional Immortality

The unsaved don't suffer forever — they CEASE TO EXIST. The second death is actual death. Permanent. Final. Gone.

The biblical case:

- **John 3:16** — "should not PERISH" — apollymi means to destroy utterly
- **Romans 6:23** — "the wages of sin is DEATH" — not eternal life in torment
- **Matthew 10:28** — "fear Him who is able to DESTROY both soul and body in Gehenna"
- **2 Thessalonians 1:9** — "punished with everlasting DESTRUCTION" — the destruction is permanent, not the process
- **Malachi 4:1,3** — the wicked "shall be ashes under the soles of your feet"
- **Psalm 37:20** — "the wicked shall perish... into smoke they shall vanish away"
- **Obadiah 1:16** — "they shall be as though they had never been"
- **Revelation 20:14** — the lake of fire is "the SECOND DEATH"

The logic: Only God has immortality (1 Timothy 6:16). Eternal life is a GIFT given to believers (Romans 6:23). If you don't receive the gift, you don't have eternal life — in ANY form. You can't be tormented forever if you don't exist forever. Immortality is conditional on being in Christ.

### View 2: Universal Reconciliation (Apokatastasis)

Eventually — after a period of corrective punishment — ALL of creation is restored to God. Everyone. The lake of fire is purifying, not punitive. God's love wins in the end.

The biblical case:

- **1 Timothy 2:4** — God *"desires ALL men to be saved."* If God desires ALL and God is sovereign... does He not get what He wants?
- **1 Timothy 4:10** — *"the living God, who is the Savior of ALL men, especially of those who believe."* Savior of ALL — especially believers, but not exclusively.
- **1 Corinthians 15:22** — *"as in Adam ALL die, even so in Christ ALL shall be made alive."*
- **Romans 5:18** — *"through one Man's righteous act the free gift came to ALL men, resulting in justification of life."*
- **Colossians 1:19-20** — *"by Him to RECONCILE ALL THINGS to Himself... having made peace through the blood of His cross."*
- **Philippians 2:10-11** — *"EVERY knee should bow... EVERY tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord."* Every. Including those "under the earth."
- **Acts 3:21** — *"the times of RESTORATION OF ALL THINGS, which God has spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began."*
- **Romans 11:32** — *"God has committed them all to disobedience, that He might have MERCY ON ALL."*
- **Lamentations 3:31-33** — *"The Lord will not cast off forever. Though He causes grief, yet He will show compassion."*

This was the MAJORITY view in the early church for the first 500 years. Origen taught it. Clement of Alexandria taught it. Gregory of Nyssa (who helped formulate the doctrine of the Trinity) taught it. These weren't fringe thinkers. They were the architects of orthodox Christianity.

The logic: God IS love. His mercy endures FOREVER (Psalm 136 — 26 times). If aionios means "age-lasting" rather than "infinite," the punishment is real but not permanent. It's corrective, not retributive. Like a father disciplining a child — the goal is restoration.

---

### View 3: Eternal Conscious Torment (traditional church view)

The biblical case:

- **Matthew 25:46** — "everlasting punishment" (IF aionios means infinite)
- **Revelation 14:11** — "the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever"
- **Revelation 20:10** — the devil, beast, and false prophet tormented "forever and ever"
- **Mark 9:48** — "where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched"
- **Luke 16:26** — "a great gulf fixed"

The issues:
- Depends on aionios meaning "infinite" — a translation choice, not a certainty
- Revelation 14:11 echoes Isaiah 34:10 about EDOM — Edom isn't still burning. The smoke ascending is an image of complete destruction.
- Revelation 20:10 specifically mentions the devil, beast, and false prophet — not ordinary humans
- It makes God worse than any human dictator — infinite punishment for finite sins
- It means God FAILS to get what He wants (all men saved)
- It wasn't the majority view of the early church

## What I Actually Think

For those on the narrow road: resurrected life, new creation, reigning with Christ, face-to-face with God. Clear. Beautiful.

For those NOT on the narrow road: there are real consequences. But the NATURE of that judgment has been grotesquely distorted by the church.

Is it possible that the "lake of fire" is purifying rather than punitive — burning away everything that isn't of God? Is it possible that "every knee will bow and every tongue confess" isn't forced submission but eventual recognition? Is it possible that God's love really does win in the end?

I don't know with certainty. And anyone who says they know is selling something.

But whatever the answer is, it will be CONSISTENT with God's character. And God's character is love that sent His Son to die for people who hated Him.

**1 John 4:8** — God IS love. Not God has love. God IS love. Whatever happens after death will be an expression of THAT nature — not a contradiction of it.
