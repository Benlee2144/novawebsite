# How To Actually Operate From Your Spirit
### A Practical Daily Guide — Ben & Fredrick, February 22, 2026

## The Core Problem

You have two signals running at all times. Your **spirit** broadcasts one frequency. Your **soul** broadcasts another. Your body and your life follow whichever signal is stronger.

For most Christians, the soul signal is BLASTING — it's been running unchecked your whole life. Every worry, fear, reaction, anxious thought — that's your soul running the show. Your spirit is still connected to God, still carrying the Kingdom. But it's a whisper in a room full of screaming.

Operating from your spirit isn't about learning something new. It's about **turning down the soul volume and turning up the spirit volume.**

## The 6 Practices

### ① Morning — Set The Frequency BEFORE The World Gets In

The first thing most people do is grab their phone. Emails. Texts. News. You just handed your soul the microphone for the entire day.

**Instead:** Wake up and be still. Even 5 minutes. Not reciting prayers. Not reading a devotional out of duty. Just being present with God.

> *"Be still and know that I am God."* — Psalm 46:10

That word "know" in Hebrew is **yada** — intimate experiential knowledge. The same word used for Adam "knowing" Eve. That level of closeness.

**This sets your spirit as the lead signal for the day** — before your soul starts its anxiety playlist.

### ② Recognize The Switch — Soul vs. Spirit In Real Time

Stuff happens. Someone cuts you off. Bank account is low. Your kid is screaming. Something hits wrong.

In that MOMENT you have a choice:

| | **Soul Response** | **Spirit Response** |
|---|---|---|
| Speed | Instant, automatic | Requires a pause |
| Sound | "Fix this! React NOW!" | "The King is on the throne. Be still." |
| Fuel | Fear, anger, offense | Peace, authority, trust |
| Focus | The circumstance | The One in charge |

**The practice:** When you feel that rush — anger, anxiety, fear — PAUSE. One second. Ask: *"Is this my soul or my spirit talking?"*

At first you'll catch it AFTER you react. Over time, you catch it BEFORE. That's Romans 12:2 — the mind being renewed in real time.

### ③ Speak FROM The Kingdom, Not From The Circumstance

Most people pray FROM their problems:
> *"God, I'm broke. God, I'm sick. God, I'm scared."*

That's your soul talking to God about how bad things are. You're actually **agreeing with the circumstance** and asking God to change it.

**Kingdom prayer** speaks FROM the reality of who God is:
> *"Father, Your Word says You supply all my needs according to Your riches in glory (Philippians 4:19). Provision is already handled. My source isn't my job — it's You."*

That's not positive thinking. That's FAITH — calling things that are not as though they are (**Romans 4:17**). Abraham did it. God does it. He told you to do it.

You're not denying reality. You're choosing **WHICH reality** to operate from.

### ④ Worship Is A Lifestyle Frequency, Not Sunday Morning

Worship is tuning your spirit to God's frequency. It's not about music quality or singing talent.

- Driving in your car, just talking to Him like He's in the passenger seat. Because He is.
- Putting on worship music as a **frequency adjustment** — changing the signal your mind receives.
- Practicing awareness of His presence in the grocery store, at your desk, changing your son's diaper.

> *"Pray without ceasing."* — 1 Thessalonians 5:17

This doesn't mean pray 24/7. It means stay in **communion** 24/7. Prayer is talking. Communion is awareness.

Brother Lawrence (1600s) — a monk who worked in a kitchen and felt as close to God washing dishes as taking communion. Because he practiced presence.

### ⑤ Feed Your Spirit More Than Your Soul

Whatever you feed grows. Whatever you starve dies.

| | **Feeding Your Soul** | **Feeding Your Spirit** |
|---|---|---|
| | 3 hrs scrolling | Time in silence |
| | News (fear) | The Word while driving |
| | Social media (comparison) | Teaching that builds faith |
| | Entertainment (distraction) | Journaling what God shows you |
| | | Reading the Bible as conversation |

This isn't about guilt. It's about **spiritual physics.** You become what you consume.

If your soul is getting a feast and your spirit is getting crumbs — don't be surprised when your soul runs the show.

### ⑥ The Test — Peace

How do you know which one you're operating from?

**Peace.**

Your spirit ALWAYS has peace. Even in chaos. Even when nothing makes sense. Because it's connected to the Prince of Peace and the Kingdom doesn't have anxiety in it.

Your soul ALMOST NEVER has peace. Always processing, always worried about the next thing, replaying the last thing.

> *"Let the peace of God rule in your hearts."* — Colossians 3:15

That word "rule" is **brabeuō** — it means **to act as an umpire.**

Let peace be the umpire:
- Making a decision and you have peace → **that's your spirit**
- Something "makes sense" logically but no peace → **that's your spirit saying no, your soul saying yes**

**Trust the peace. Even when your mind disagrees.**

## The Honest Truth

This isn't a formula. It's a relationship.

Some days you'll operate from your spirit all day and everything flows. Some days your soul will hijack you by 8am.

The point isn't perfection. The point is **awareness.** Every time you catch yourself in your soul and shift back to your spirit — that's a rep. That's spiritual muscle.

You're not becoming something new. You're becoming **what you already are.**

---

## Start Here

Tomorrow morning. Before you touch your phone.

**5 minutes of stillness. Just you and Him.**

That's the first step.
