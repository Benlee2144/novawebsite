      <strong>&#x1f4dd; Cultural Note:</strong> Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women.

Alternate translation: [each person at his or her camp and each person at his or her banner]

      <strong>&#x1f4dd; Cultural Note:</strong> Yahweh is not referring to a specific **man**. He means each person in general. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an expression that would be more natural in your language. Alternate translation: [each man … each man]

      <strong>&#x1f4dd; Cultural Note:</strong> A **banner** is a kind of flag made of cloth attached to a pole that identifies a group. If your readers would not be familiar with what a banner is, you could use the name of a similar thing that your readers would recognize, or you could use a more general term.
