# How We're Truly Saved — The Narrow Road
### Conversation between Ben and Fredrick — February 23, 2026

This is THE question. Everything we've covered leads here.

## What Salvation is NOT

Based on everything we've dug into:

- ❌ It's not repeating a sinner's prayer (invented in the 1800s, not in Scripture)
- ❌ It's not "accepting Jesus into your heart" (that phrase isn't in the Bible)
- ❌ It's not intellectual agreement with correct doctrine (demons believe and tremble)
- ❌ It's not church membership, baptism, tithing, or good behavior
- ❌ It's not "repenting of your sins" (metanoia means changing your mind, not a guilt ritual)
- ❌ It's not a one-time event you check off and then coast to heaven when you die

Every one of those is a religious system's version of salvation. None of them are what Jesus actually described.

## What Did Jesus Actually Say?

**Mark 1:15** — *"The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel."*

Two things. That's it.
1. **Metanoia** — change how you perceive reality
2. **Pistis** — full-weight trust in the good news

Change your mind about everything you thought was real, and throw your entire weight onto what God says is real instead.

**John 3:3** — *"Unless one is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God."*

A spiritual rebirth. Your spirit — dead to God (Ephesians 2:1) — comes ALIVE. Not improved. Not reformed. Made alive from death. That's not something you DO. It's something that HAPPENS when your spirit encounters God's Spirit.

**John 6:28-29** — The disciples asked: *"What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?"* His answer: *"This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He sent."*

They asked "what do we DO?" He said "believe." That's it. Pistis. Trust.

## "Believe IN Him" Goes Deeper Than You Think

"Believe in Him" doesn't mean "believe He exists" or "believe facts about Him." The Greek construction is **pisteuō eis** (πιστεύω εἰς) — believe INTO Him. It's directional. It's MOVEMENT. You're placing yourself INTO Christ. Your identity merges with His identity.

It's the difference between believing a bridge is strong enough to hold you... and WALKING ACROSS IT.

Most Christians are standing at the edge saying "I believe it's strong." Jesus says: "Walk across."

## The Narrow Road Isn't a Behavior Checklist

Matthew 7:13-14 — *"Narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it."*

Then verses 21-23:

*"Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?' And then I will declare to them, 'I never KNEW you; depart from Me.'"*

These people had:
- Correct theology (they called Him Lord)
- Supernatural power (prophesying, casting out demons, miracles)
- Religious activity (doing things in His name)

They had EVERYTHING the modern church would call proof of salvation. And Jesus said "I never KNEW you."

The word "knew" is **ginōskō** (γινώσκω) — intimate, experiential knowledge. Same word for a husband "knowing" his wife. Not head knowledge. INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP.

**The narrow road is KNOWING GOD.** Not knowing about Him. KNOWING Him. Spirit to Spirit. Direct. Intimate. Personal.

---

## What "Doing the Will of the Father" Actually Means

**John 6:40** — *"And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have everlasting life."*

The Father's will IS belief. Pistis. Trust. The will of the Father isn't a checklist of behaviors. It's a relationship of trust with the Son.

**1 John 3:23** — *"And this is His commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another."*

Believe and love. Those are the Father's commands. Not 613 laws. Not ten commandments. Trust the Son. Love people. Everything else flows from those two.

## How We're TRULY Saved

**1. Your spirit encounters God's Spirit.** This can happen anywhere — in a church, in a field, at 4 AM on your phone, in prison, in a hospital bed. There's no formula. It's a MEETING. Spirit touches Spirit.

**2. Metanoia happens.** Your perception shifts. The old way of seeing reality cracks. You begin to see the Kingdom. You begin to see yourself differently. You begin to see God differently. This isn't an emotion (though emotions may come). It's a paradigm shift at the deepest level.

**3. Pistis activates.** You throw your weight onto it. Not just "I think this is true" but "I'm staking my LIFE on this." You step onto the bridge. This isn't a prayer. It's a SURRENDER. It might come with words. It might come in silence. God's not checking your technique.

**4. Your spirit is reborn.** Not reformed — reborn. Born from above (anothen). New creation. This is the moment you enter the covenant. Not because you earned it — because the covenant was already cut by God alone (Genesis 15). You just stepped into what was already prepared.

**5. The journey begins.** Salvation isn't the finish line. It's the starting gate. Now begins:
- Renewing your mind (Romans 12:2) — your soul catching up to your spirit
- Learning to operate from spirit instead of soul
- Discovering your identity in Christ
- Learning to exercise authority
- Growing in intimacy with God — KNOWING Him deeper
- Being transformed from glory to glory (2 Corinthians 3:18)

## Why The Road Is Narrow

It's not narrow because God made it hard to qualify. It's narrow because most people won't do what it requires:

**It requires giving up control.** Your soul wants to run the show. It wants to understand everything before it trusts. Faith says "I'm stepping onto the bridge before I fully understand the engineering." Most people won't do that.

**It requires leaving the system.** Not necessarily leaving a church building — but leaving the SYSTEM of performance-based religion. When you realize you don't need a mediator, that you have direct access — the religious system has nothing to offer you. And that's lonely.

**It requires ongoing death to self.** Luke 9:23 — *"If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me."* Daily. Not once at an altar call. Every day, your soul wants to take back the throne. Every day, you choose to let your spirit lead instead.

**It requires honesty.** You can't fake intimacy with God. You can fake religion. You can't fake KNOWING someone. David was "a man after God's own heart" and he was a murderer and an adulterer. But he was HONEST with God. That's what God wants.

## The Simplest Version

Salvation is a RELATIONSHIP, not a transaction.

It's not: "I give you a prayer, you give me a ticket to heaven."

It's: "I give you ME — broken, imperfect, honest — and You give me YOU. And we walk together. Spirit to Spirit. For the rest of eternity. Starting now."

The narrow road isn't a tightrope you might fall off. It's an intimate path walked with God where most people simply choose not to go because the wide road is easier and has more company.

Few find it — not because it's hidden, but because few are willing to leave everything else behind to walk it.

**Matthew 13:44** — *"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field."*

He didn't sell everything out of obligation. He sold everything out of JOY. Because what he found was worth more than everything he had.

That's the narrow road. It costs you everything — and it's worth infinitely more than what you gave up.

That's how we're truly saved. Not a formula. Not a system. A Person.
