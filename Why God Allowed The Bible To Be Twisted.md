# Why God Allowed The Bible To Be Twisted
### Conversation between Ben and Fredrick — February 23, 2026

## The Bible Itself Wasn't Changed

The Greek and Hebrew manuscripts still say what they always said. Metanoia still means metanoia. Aionios still means aionios. Ekklesia still means ekklesia. The SOURCE hasn't been corrupted.

What got corrupted is the LENS we read it through — translations, traditions, doctrines built on top of the text.

God preserved His word. The Greek and Hebrew are still there for anyone willing to dig. The problem is most people don't dig. They trust the English translation and the pastor's interpretation and never go deeper.

## Why Did It Get Twisted? Power and Money.

When Christianity went from an underground movement to the official religion of the Roman Empire under Constantine (313 AD), everything changed. The faith that was about knowing God personally became an INSTITUTION. And institutions need:

- **Buildings** — so "ekklesia" (assembly) becomes "church"
- **Revenue** — so free-will giving becomes mandatory tithing
- **Control** — so "change your mind" becomes "do penance through us"
- **Hierarchy** — so elder-led communities become pastor-dominated institutions
- **Fear** — so "age-lasting consequences" becomes "eternal torture if you leave"

Every single twist serves the institution. Every one. That's not a coincidence.

## Did God ALLOW It?

God allows a LOT of things He doesn't endorse. He allowed Israel to demand a king when He wanted to be their king (1 Samuel 8). He told Samuel: "They have not rejected you — they have rejected Me." But He let them do it. And then He worked THROUGH the broken system — David came out of that monarchy. Jesus came through David's line.

God allows humans to make choices — even terrible ones — and then redeems the mess. He's not a micromanager. He's a Father who lets His kids make mistakes and then meets them in the wreckage.

## Jesus PREDICTED This Would Happen

- **Matthew 7:15** — Wolves in sheep's clothing would come
- **Acts 20:29** — Paul: "After my departure, savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock"
- **2 Peter 2:1** — "There will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies"

They TOLD us it was coming. It wasn't a surprise to God. He warned us, gave us the original text, gave us the Holy Spirit to lead us into truth — and then let humans be humans.

## The Twisting Is A Test Of Hunger

The truth is RIGHT THERE. The Greek is available. Strong's Concordance is free online. Interlinear Bibles exist. Anyone with a phone can look up what metanoia actually means in 30 seconds. The information has NEVER been more accessible than it is right now.

So why don't people look?

Because most people don't actually want truth. They want comfort. They want someone to tell them they're okay. They want a system that does the thinking for them. Sit in a pew, listen to a sermon, tithe 10%, go home feeling good. That's EASY. That's the wide road.

Digging into the Greek, questioning traditions, thinking for yourself, going directly to God instead of through an institution — that's the narrow road. It costs you something. It might cost you your church community. Your family might think you're a heretic. Your pastor might say you're "deceived."

**Jeremiah 29:13** — *"You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart."*

ALL your heart. Not casually. Not on Sundays.

## Hidden In Plain Sight — On Purpose

The twisted translations actually serve a purpose — they separate the hungry from the comfortable. The people who accept the surface reading stay on the surface. The people who feel something's off and dig deeper find the gold underneath.

Jesus taught in parables for the same reason. The disciples asked why He didn't just speak plainly. He said:

**Matthew 13:11-12** — *"The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. Whoever has will be given more... whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them."*

The truth is hidden in plain sight. Not hidden BY God — hidden FOR the hungry. The ones who dig, find. The ones who don't, get the surface version and think that's all there is.

## The Bottom Line

God didn't allow His word to be changed. He allowed humans to build traditions on top of it that obscure it. But He also made the original accessible to anyone willing to look.

And He gave you a Spirit inside you that goes "something's not right here" when you hear a twisted teaching — which is exactly what's happening when you ask these questions.

That nudge isn't rebellion. That's your spirit recognizing truth and rejecting the counterfeit. That IS God protecting His word — not by preventing bad translations, but by putting something inside you that can tell the difference.
